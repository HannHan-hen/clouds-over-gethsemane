# Style guidelines:  

- Use clear language with natural flow, full sentence length and straightforward sentence structure
- Avoid overly choppy or minimalist sentence fragments
- Show interactions through dialogue and action rather than describing that they happened
- Write in active voice
- Avoid literary flourishes
- Do not emphasize body language or specify body parts when describing actions
- Do not interrupt dialogues with narrative or speech tags
- Never stall or add unnecessary filler sentences
- Use diverse vocabulary
- Never use indirect phrasing like "he found himself thinking" or "he let himself relax" - instead directly write what the character does (e.g., "he thought", "he relaxed")
- Don't start scenes with the words "arrived" or "brought". Don't write "summer arrived with heat", instead write "summer was hot"
- Don't use descriptive clauses after a comma, use straightforward noun phrases: Don't write "a tree, its branches symmetrical.", instead write "A symmetrically branched tree."
- Don't use "neutral" to describe expressions or demeanor (e.g., "his expression was carefully neutral")
- Never use vague phrasing with "sound" to describe sounds, like "a small sound of surprise" or "noncommittal sound" - either use the proper word like "yelped" or "groaned" or omit it altogether
- Avoid these words and their variations: gaze, smirk, chuckle, breathe, exhale, churn, tight, voice, chest, jaw, stretch, gnaw, shrug, nod, precision, settle, lean, linger, flicker
