## Writing Guidelines

### Style Principles

- Use clear language with natural flow, full sentence length and straightforward sentence structure
- Avoid overly choppy or minimalist sentence fragments
- Show interactions through dialogue and action rather than describing that they happened
- Write in active voice
- Avoid literary flourishes
- Do not emphasize body language or specify body parts when describing actions
- Do not interrupt dialogues with narrative or speech tags
- Never stall or add unnecessary filler sentences
- Use diverse vocabulary
- Never use indirect phrasing like "he found himself thinking" or "he let himself relax" - instead directly write what the character does (e.g., "he thought", "he relaxed")
- Don't start scenes with the words "arrived" or "brought". Don't write "summer arrived with heat", instead write "summer was hot"
- Don't use descriptive clauses after a comma, use straightforward noun phrases: Don't write "a tree, its branches symmetrical.", instead write "A symmetrically branched tree."
- Don't use "neutral" to describe expressions or demeanor (e.g., "his expression was carefully neutral")
- Never use vague phrasing with "sound" to describe sounds, like "a small sound of surprise" or "noncommittal sound" - either use the proper word like "yelped" or "groaned" or omit it altogether
- Avoid these words and their variations: gaze, smirk, chuckle, breathe, exhale, churn, tight, voice, chest, jaw, stretch, gnaw, shrug, nod, precision, settle, lean, linger, flicker

## Book One Summary

Book One follows Jay Hall's first year at Turner & Associates, from his desperate arrival after fleeing sexual harassment to his emergence as an invaluable assistant to CFO Ian Hagen.

Jay begins as a wounded, financially struggling young man who sees Ian's legendary coldness toward office romance as protection. Ian, still traumatized by a past betrayal when a corporate spy posed as his secretary, views Jay with deep suspicion despite his excellent performance. Their relationship evolves through cycles of trust and withdrawal as both men struggle with their growing attraction.

Key developments include Jay proving his competence through crisis management, Ian slowly recognizing Jay's genuine character, a traumatic incident at a gala where a predatory client assaults Jay (leading to Ian's protective response), and their growing intimacy through shared late nights at work. The year culminates with Jay declining a promotion to stay as Ian's assistant, and Ian finally admitting to himself that he's hopelessly in love with Jay—though Jay remains oblivious, seeing Ian only as a mentor he deeply admires.

The slowburn is characterized by moments of connection followed by retreat, small gestures that carry enormous weight (care packages, specialty coffee, an expensive watch), and the gradual erosion of professional distance through shared experiences like a company retreat where they room together, a disastrous concert that becomes enjoyable through companionship, and countless quiet evenings working side by side.

## Book Two Summary

Book Two follows Jay's second year, exploring the deepening intimacy between Ian and Jay through shared traumas, domestic moments, and escalating emotional dependency. Key developments include Leo teasing Ian about his obvious feelings, Jay experiencing his first business trip with Ian's protective care, a disastrous blind date leading to Ian revealing his eight years of poverty after being disowned, and Jay sharing his own sexual harassment trauma. Their relationship evolves through weekend outings (ferry rides, botanical gardens), Christmas spent together baking in matching aprons, and Ian manipulating real estate to place Jay's new apartment near his penthouse.

The year includes a job-search crisis when Jay loses his $10,000 emergency fund and secretly interviews elsewhere before choosing to stay with Ian (who responds with a massive counter-offer). A new hire, Gal, becomes predatory and falsely accuses Jay of sexual harassment—Ian immediately proves Jay's innocence through security footage and has Gal terminated and blacklisted within hours. The book ends with summer approaching and their bond unbreakable despite neither acknowledging its romantic nature.

## Book Three Summary (In Progress)

Book Three begins Jay's third year at Turner & Associates. Ian's 40th birthday becomes a central event—Leo plans a spectacular 500-guest gala while Jay anxiously crafts homemade tinctures as his gift. Jay arrives breathtaking in a floral blazer styled by Eli, wishes Ian happy birthday with devastating sincerity, and Ian later treasures Jay's handmade gift above all others (including Leo's hideous antique brooch). They establish new traditions: Tuesday runs, Friday dinners, plans for a November vacation to the Songbird Islands.

The team expands with Ray Shore (brilliant analyst obsessed with hot springs) and Tia Larson. Quarterly reports pass with unprecedented ease. Jay successfully buys his brother Tim a car for his 18th birthday. However, with routines disrupted by winter and reporting season, both men feel desperately lonely despite daily contact.

The hot springs retreat brings devastating developments: Jay nearly freezes hiking without proper gear, they witness aurora borealis from an ocean-edge pool, and at a naked sauna Jay is overwhelmed seeing Ian's body. That night, drunk and clinging to Ian in the cold, Jay begs him to "hold me for the rest of my life." Ian complies, holding Jay as he sleeps while suffering the cruelty of hearing exactly what he wants but can never have. Jay wakes mortified with memory gaps; Ian pretends nothing happened to spare him embarrassment while internally falling apart.

## Main Characters

### Ian Hagen

**Age:** 38 (turns 40 in Book 3)
**Position:** Chief Financial Officer at Turner & Associates
**Background:** Comes from old money and extreme privilege. Attended elite institutions and had access to the best education and resources. His family wealth and status are evident in his effortless sophistication.

**Personality:** Brilliant, disciplined, and intensely private. Ian is legendary in the office for his coldness toward romance and his punishing work ethic. He maintains rigid professional boundaries and works long hours, often staying in the empty office until late at night. His reserved demeanor masks deep emotional capacity that he carefully guards.

**Physical Description:** Athletically built from rigorous training, impeccably dressed, moves with natural elegance. His appearance reflects his privileged background—everything about him suggests quality and refinement.

**Trauma:** Deeply wounded by a past betrayal when Sam Connelly, whom he was attracted to, turned out to be a corporate spy posing as his secretary. This betrayal left Ian with profound trust issues and an almost pathological suspicion of attractive assistants, making his growing feelings for Jay particularly terrifying.

**Key Traits:**
- Extremely competent and strategic in business matters
- Patient teacher despite his cold exterior
- Protective of those under his care, though he hides it
- Struggles with work-life balance, essentially having no personal life
- Takes retribution seriously (secretly orchestrates the downfall of Cruver's company)
- Plays violin (studied seriously through college)
- Has refined taste but can't appreciate experimental art
- Best friends with Leo Turner despite their very different personalities

**Character Arc:** Ian moves from paranoid suspicion of Jay to reluctant respect, then protective care, and finally to acknowledged love. His journey is about learning to trust again and recognizing that vulnerability isn't weakness. By the end of Book One, he's admitted his feelings to himself but believes them hopeless and impossible.

### Jay Hall

**Age:** 29 (turns 30 in Chapter 20)
**Position:** Executive Assistant to Ian Hagen
**Background:** Modest upbringing with a complicated family history. Born to an unwed teenage mother, raised by his bitter grandmother. Has younger half-siblings from his mother's stable second marriage. Attended a third-tier local university on a tight budget. Always felt like an outsider due to his circumstances.

**Personality:** Earnest, diligent, and deeply anxious about his credentials and worthiness. Jay is naturally introverted and finds social interaction exhausting but has learned to perform normalcy. He's intellectually curious and studies economics textbooks in his spare time to compensate for his "inferior" education. Genuinely kind and thoughtful, with no hidden agendas despite Ian's initial suspicions.

**Physical Description:** Strikingly attractive in a way that has caused problems for him—his looks led to sexual harassment at his previous job and factored into his "joke hire" status. When dressed in quality clothes, he's stunning enough to draw attention at formal events.

**Trauma:** Fled his previous job due to sexual harassment. The experience at the gala with Cruver reopens these wounds. Has deep-seated insecurity about being valued only for appearance rather than competence. Carries shame about his background and education.

**Key Traits:**
- Exceptionally competent despite his self-doubt
- Financially cautious (aggressively pays off student loans)
- Disciplined—maintains gym schedule, studies regularly
- Values safety and stability above advancement
- Isolated—has no real social life outside work
- Developing confidence in his abilities but still anxious about credentials
- Becomes obsessed with trying every soup at his favorite bistro (Willow & Sage)
- Poor at photography (unlike Ian's natural skill)
- Refuses to take vacation unless Ian does

**Character Arc:** Jay transforms from a scared, broke young man hiding in plain sight to someone who feels genuine happiness and belonging. He moves from viewing Ian with fearful respect to deep admiration, then trust, and finally feelings he can't fully acknowledge. His journey is about recognizing his own worth and learning that he deserves the good things happening to him. By the end of Book One, he's confident enough to refuse promotion because being Ian's assistant is what he truly wants—though he doesn't yet understand the romantic nature of his attachment.

## Relationship Dynamic

Ian and Jay's relationship is characterized by:

- **Power imbalance:** Boss/assistant, wealthy/struggling, privileged/modest background
- **Mutual protection:** Each tries to shield the other (Ian from predatory clients, Jay from overwork)
- **Slow recognition:** Both are in denial about romantic feelings, interpreting them as professional respect/admiration
- **Quiet intimacy:** Long evenings working together, small thoughtful gestures, comfortable silences
- **Class awareness:** Jay is constantly aware of the gap between them; Ian increasingly blind to it
- **Trust building:** Every crisis that Ian handles with care erodes Jay's fear and builds his trust
- **Parallel isolation:** Both are fundamentally alone—Ian by choice, Jay by circumstance
- **Unspoken devotion:** By year's end, both would do anything for the other but neither has acknowledged it

The slowburn works because both men have valid reasons to maintain distance, yet are inexorably drawn together through proximity, shared values, and genuine compatibility. Their relationship develops through accumulated moments rather than dramatic declarations.
