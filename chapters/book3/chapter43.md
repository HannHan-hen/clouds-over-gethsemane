Chapter 43: The celebration
Scene 1
Gold lions and carved dragons
Jay had never been to Leo's office before. He half-expected gold lions on the furniture, carved dragons, maybe even a water feature. Instead, he found a plain desk and a neat bookshelf. Almost aggressively normal.
"Something wrong?" Leo asked from behind his desk.
"No, I just—I expected something different."
"Like what? A throne?"
"Maybe."
Leo laughed. "My father has the throne room. I just needed somewhere to hide when he's being insufferable. Sit. What's this about?"
"I need an extra invitation. For someone named Eli."
Leo's eyebrow arched immediately, theatrically suspicious. "Eli? And who is this mysterious Eli?"
"Someone who's been kind to me. I want to pay them back."
"By inviting him to Ian's birthday party. Interesting choice."
"Is it a problem?"
"Not at all. I'll have an invitation prepared. Anything else?" 
"No. Thank you."
"You're very welcome. This is going to be a spectacular party, Jay. You'll see."
Jay left before Leo could ask any more questions.
That evening Jay called his mother. The conversation started with pleasantries—how was work, how was the apartment, had he been eating properly—before moving to the real reason for the call.
"Tim's birthday is coming up. I've been looking at cars, but the selection here is limited."
"I can look in the city. There's probably more variety."
"Would you? That would help so much."
They spent the next hour building a list: brands known for reliability, models that fit the budget, features that mattered. His mother wanted something safe. Jay wanted something that wouldn't break down every other month. Tim, apparently, wanted something that didn't look like it belonged to someone's grandfather.
"That narrows it down," Jay said dryly.
His mother laughed. "He's eighteen. He'll be happy with anything that runs and doesn't embarrass him."
"I'll see what I can find," Jay promised.
"Thank you, sweetheart. I don't know what we'd do without you."
Jay said goodbye and set his phone down, staring at the list of car models she had sent. He could do this. It was just research.
Friday dinners with Ian had become the highlight of Jay’s week. The previous one had been canceled for Tia’s welcome party, leaving him unsure whether the tradition would continue or if it had dissolved for good. When Ian stopped by his desk that afternoon to invite him out, relief rushed through him so fast he had to pause before answering.
The restaurant was different this time, but it had the same inviting atmosphere, the same sense of being in a place that felt like theirs.
“How’s your week been?” Ian asked once they’d ordered.
"Busy. I'm helping my mother look for a car. For Tim's birthday."
"That's thoughtful of you."
"The selection in their town is terrible. I figured I'd look here instead."
"I know someone."
"Of course you do."
"A reputable dealer," Ian continued, ignoring the faint sarcasm. "I can arrange an appointment. He owes me a favor."
"You don't have to—"
"It's no trouble. Give me the list of models you're considering, and I'll have him pull together options."
Jay pulled out his phone and showed Ian the notes from the call. 
"I'll call him. You should hear from him by Monday."
"Thank you."
"It's nothing," Ian said.
They ate and talked about work, neither of them paying real attention to the details. The joy of being together filled the space more than the words did. When they finally got up to leave, Jay looked at Ian with that helplessly tender expression he never noticed himself making, and Ian wanted to hold onto that look forever.
Saturday morning at the gym, Rus greeted Jay with amusement clear on his face.
"You won't believe this. Luc contacted me yesterday. About the party," Rus said.
"What about it?" Jay asked.
"Apparently he's arranging clothes for all of us. The whole gym group. He wants to make sure we're appropriately dressed. Do these rich people think we're going to show up with clubs and pelts?"
Jay laughed. "I don't think that's it."
"Well, we're getting fitted next week. It'll be a circus."
"Probably," Jay agreed.
Rus clapped him on the shoulder. "Don't worry about Ema, by the way. We've all got her back. She'll be safe."
"I know," Jay said, but it didn't stop the knot in his stomach from tightening every time he thought about it.
"Also, we got a group gift for your boss. It's good. Really good."
"What is it?"
"Not telling."
Jay groaned. "You're all impossible."
"We're delightful. Now stop stalling and get on the treadmill."
Saturday evening Jay was elbow-deep in tinctures when Leo appeared at his door without warning.
Jay sighed. "What do you want?"
"I brought Eli's invitation," Leo said, holding up an envelope. Then he stopped, taking in the kitchen. "What is all this?"
The kitchen looked like an apothecary had exploded. Bottles covered every surface—some full of dark liquid, others pale amber, still more in various stages of infusion. Jars of herbs and spices lined the counter. The beautiful crystal bottles Jay had ordered sat in their protective packaging, waiting to be filled. Notes covered in Jay's handwriting were scattered across the table.
"It's nothing."
"This is not nothing. This is a production facility." Leo picked up one of the experimental jars. "What are you making?"
Jay snatched it back. "Ian's birthday gift. And you're not touching anything."
"Can I try it?"
"No."
"Come on. Just a taste."
"No. It's for Ian. I won't let you taint Ian's gift with your meddling paws."
"You know, I'm starting to think you like him."
Jay stilled for a second before resuming his work. "He's my boss."
"Sure. Your boss. Who you make artisan liqueurs for."
"It's a gift. For his birthday."
"And it's very sweet. Painfully, devastatingly sweet."
Leo wandered around the kitchen, inspecting labels, asking questions about ingredients, and generally making himself at home. Eventually he dropped onto the couch and started rattling off details about the party. He left an hour later and Jay returned to his bottles.
Monday morning Jay slipped out of the office during a quiet stretch and crossed the street to the boutique. Eli was arranging a display near the window and looked up when the door chimed.
"Jay. Back so soon?"
"I brought the invitation for the party, if you still want to come."
Eli took the envelope as though it might dissolve in his hands. He opened it, read it, and then looked up with awe.
"You really invited me," Eli said.
"I said I would."
"I know, but—This is incredible. Thank you."
"It's just a party."
"It's not just a party. Not from what I've heard. What are you getting him?"
"Why do you want to know?"
"Because I need to get him something too. Standard courtesy for attending someone's birthday celebration. And while it's well-known that he likes good alcohol and classical music, you probably know him better. Any insights?"
"He's very into fitness and spends a lot of time at the gym. And he loves his work."
"That's not exactly helpful for gift ideas."
"I know. He's difficult to buy for. Everything he wants, he already has. Everything he needs, he's already arranged for himself."
"So you're going with alcohol?"
"Something like that. But classical music is always safe. Recordings, concert tickets, music-related items. He appreciates quality in that area."
They chatted pleasantly for a few more minutes—Eli asking about Jay's work, Jay learning that Eli had been at Hathaway's for four years and enjoyed the customer interaction. Jay was relieved that Eli seemed nice. Not pushy, not inappropriately curious, just friendly. Maybe inviting him hadn't been reckless after all.
The car dealership meeting happened later that week. Ian's contact was a middle-aged man with no interest in overselling. He listened to Jay's requirements, consulted his inventory, and promised to find something from the shortlist.
"Good price, excellent condition. I'll contact you with options."
"Thank you."
"Ian vouched for you. That's enough for me."
Another problem solved, another piece falling into place. And then, before Jay even registered the passing days, the final week before the party was already at his door.
Jay sat on his couch surrounded by three bottles. He had chosen the best of his tinctures, the ones with the clearest flavours. He had tucked them into the wooden box, and written a note describing each one. He stared at the box, willing his heart to slow down. He wanted this to be perfect. He wanted Ian to like it, to understand how much thought had gone into every step.
He definitely wanted too much.
Scene 2
Incandescent
It was raining on Tuesday. Not the gentle autumn drizzle that made everything seem romantic, but a relentless downpour that turned the streets into rivers.
At six, Ian appeared at Jay's desk. "Ready to go?"
"Yeah."
They drove through the rain in silence. Jay watched the water run down the window and felt an odd weight in his chest.
"We have to  cancel the run," Ian said.
"I was looking forward to it," Jay replied. He was unreasonably disappointed. Now the evening stretched ahead, empty.
"So was I."
"Next week."
"Yes. Next week."
Ian pulled up outside Jay's building, and Jay hesitated before getting out.
"Thanks for the ride."
"Of course."
Jay walked inside, shook off his coat, and stood in the middle of his apartment feeling restless and gloomy. The rain drummed against the windows. It felt like a bad omen.
Wednesday afternoon, Leo cornered him at work.
"Jay. A word."
Jay followed Leo to his office, already suspicious.
"I've arranged everything for your sister's visit, just like I promised," Leo said, looking far too pleased with himself.
"What do you mean, everything?"
"The car will pick up Ema and her friend on Friday evening. They'll stay with you Friday night. Saturday morning, someone will collect them for the shopping trip—dresses, shoes, accessories. Then makeup and hair. They'll be delivered directly to the venue Saturday evening."
Jay stared at him. "Leo, that's too much—"
"Nonsense. They're your guests. They should arrive properly prepared."
"I can't afford—"
"It's my gift to them. And to you. Don't argue."
"The dresses need to be conservative. Age-appropriate."
Leo's smile was cherubic and utterly untrustworthy. "Of course."
"Leo."
"I promise. Nothing scandalous. They'll look elegant and appropriate."
Jay didn't believe him for a second, but arguing was pointless. Leo had already set everything in motion, and reversing it would cause more chaos than letting it proceed.
Wednesday evening, Jay called his mother.
"Everything's arranged. Leo's sending a car to pick them up Friday evening. They'll stay with me, then get taken care of on Saturday. Dresses, hair, makeup. Everything."
"That's very generous."
"I know it's a lot—"
"It's fine, Jay. If that's what's happening, then that's what's happening. I'll make sure they're ready Friday."
She sounded tired. Resigned. Jay wondered how many arguments she'd already had with Ema about this.
"Thanks, Mum."
After they hung up, Jay sat with his phone and stared at the wall. This was happening. Ema was coming. In three days, his sister would be at Ian's birthday party, dressed like she belonged in high society. He really hoped this wasn't a mistake.
Friday evening, the girls arrived in a flurry of giggles and enthusiasm. Jay opened the door to find Ema and Lam on the threshold, both talking at once, dragging enormous suitcases behind them.
"Jay!" Ema threw herself at him in a hug. "This is so exciting! The car was so fancy! There was bottled water and everything!"
"Hi, Ema."
"And Lam's never been to the city before, have you, Lam?"
Lam shook her head, wide-eyed. "It's huge."
"Come in," Jay said, stepping aside. "The bedroom is yours for tonight. I'll sleep on the couch."
"Really? You're the best brother ever!" Ema dragged Lam toward the bedroom. "Come on, let's unpack!"
The bedroom door flew open, the suitcases exploded across the bed, and clothes scattered everywhere. Music started playing from someone's phone. Shrieking laughter echoed through the flat.
Jay retreated to the balcony with a cup of tea. The rain had stopped, but the air still felt damp. Inside, the girls chattered endlessly about dresses and makeup and what the party would be like. Jay could hear them through the glass door.
The weekly Friday dinner with Ian was naturally cancelled. Too much happening, too many complications. Jay tried not to feel disappointed about it, but that absence felt like another bad omen.
He slept on the couch—or tried to sleep while giggling continued from his bedroom until midnight. Eventually exhaustion won and he drifted off to the sound of whispered conversations and occasional bursts of laughter.
Saturday morning, the car arrived at eleven sharp. Leo's driver was patient, waiting while the girls gathered their things and took final photos in Jay's apartment. Ema hugged Jay before leaving.
"I'll be good. I won't embarrass you."
"I know."
"And whatever you're wearing tonight, you're going to look amazing."
"Have fun."
He watched them drive away, feeling like a worried parent sending children off to their first day of school.
His phone buzzed. A message from Leo. "Small list of errands. Need these done before tonight."
The attached document was three pages long.
Jay scrolled through it in disbelief. Half the tasks were meaningless. Picking up items that could have been delivered. Confirming details that had already been confirmed twice. Dropping off materials at locations across the city. It was busywork. Pure sabotage.
He texted back: "Why?"
Leo's response came immediately: "Just trust me."
Jay didn't trust him at all. 
At three, Jay met Eli at the salon.
"Right on time. Come in. We've got two hours."
Two hours felt excessive. He sat in the chair and let Eli's team take over.
They started with his hair—washing, cutting, styling until it looked deliberately tousled but somehow elegant. Then the outfit. Jay changed into the floral blazer, the open-collar shirt, the perfectly fitted trousers. Eli adjusted the fit, made minute changes until everything sat exactly right.
"Perfect," Eli said finally, stepping back. "You look incredible."
"You're sure about the open collar?"
"I'm certain. It's sophisticated, not sloppy. Trust the vision. Ian Hagen is going to forget how to speak."
"That's not the goal."
"Then what is the goal?"
"To look... appropriate. Not like I'm trying too hard."
"You don't look like you're trying too hard. You look like you succeeded without trying at all. There's a difference." Eli handed him a small tube. "Lip balm. Use it before you leave tonight. Trust me."
"Thank you. For all of this."
"My pleasure. This is what I do. See you at the party?"
"See you there."
Jay left the salon and immediately started on the final errands. He took a taxi across town, picked up whatever Leo had ordered, then headed to another location for another pointless task. By seven, he was still running around, increasingly irritated.
He texted Rus: "Going to be late. Can you watch the girls?"
Rus replied immediately with a thumbs up.
Jay finished the last errand at seven-forty-five and finally headed to the venue. The party had started without him. He was over an hour late. He arrived at eight-ten, breathless and annoyed, holding the silver-and-gold wrapped package with its red ribbon.
The venue was stunning. A historic building with soaring ceilings, marble floors, and chandeliers that cast mystical light across everything. And people—so many people, dressed in expensive suits and gowns, holding glasses of champagne, talking and laughing.
The entrance hall opened onto a wide staircase that descended into the main space. Jay walked down, holding his gift, still catching his breath.
The crowd noticed him immediately. Conversations paused. Heads turned.
Jay walked down the staircase, acutely aware of every eye on him. He reached the bottom and headed straight for the gift table, setting his package down among the others. Then he scanned the room, looking for Ian.
Near the centre of the room, Ian turned. He froze. He forgot the party. Forgot the noise, the crowd, the obligation of the evening. He forgot why he'd been irritated moments before. Jay looked incandescent.
Jay crossed the room, weaving through the crowd, and stopped in front of Ian.
"Happy birthday," Jay said.
Ian stared at him, seemingly unable to speak.
"I know I'm late. Leo's errands. I'm sorry."
"You're—" Ian stopped, cleared his throat. "You look—"
"Ridiculous?"
"No. Not ridiculous."
The guests around them had diplomatically moved away, giving them space. Jay barely noticed.
"I hope you're enjoying the party. I know you didn't want this. But everyone here cares about you. They want to celebrate you. I wanted you to have a night where people remind you how much you matter. Because you do. You matter so much."
He hadn't meant to say it like that. Hadn't meant to be so earnest, so open. But the words were already out, and Ian was looking at him like Jay had just said something devastating.
"Thank you," Ian said.
Jay wanted to say more—to explain how important Ian had become, how much these two years had meant—but the words wouldn't come.
"I should let you get back to your guests," Jay said finally.
"Jay—"
"Happy birthday, Ian."
Jay stepped back, giving Ian space to return to the crowd. But Ian's eyes followed him, and Jay felt the weight of that attention even as he moved away.
Scene 3
Ian's world
Jay's first priority after wishing Ian happy birthday was finding Ema.
He scanned the crowd and spotted her immediately—impossible to miss in a deep blue gown with intricate black lace that looked like it had been stolen from a Victorian drama. Rus stood beside her like a wolfhound guarding a princess, and Van loomed behind them both like a gothic gargoyle carved from stone and suspicion.
Jay approached quickly. "Ema."
"Jay!" Ema beamed, spinning to show off the dress. "Look at this! Isn't it amazing?"
"It's very dramatic."
"It's beautiful," Ema corrected. She gestured to Lam, who wore a similarly theatrical gown in rose with velvet accents. "We look like we stepped out of a period film."
"You do," Jay admitted. The dresses were glamorous, absurdly over the top, and—to his immense relief—perfectly modest. High necklines, long sleeves, full skirts. Leo had actually kept his promise.
"Leo's stylist said we needed something special. Something memorable. She showed us these and we fell in love immediately." Ema spun, the skirt flowing dramatically. "I feel like a princess in a historical romance."
"You look like one too." Jay turned to Rus. "Thank you for watching them."
"No problem. Van and I have it covered. No one's getting near them without going through us first."
"I appreciate that."
The girls launched into an excited breakdown of their entire day—shopping, makeup, hair, the car ride, the moment they walked into the venue and realized how enormous the party was. Jay listened, half-relieved and half-exhausted, until he could politely extract himself.
"I need to find Leo," Jay said.
"Good luck," Rus said.
Jay found Leo near the bar, sipping champagne and looking thoroughly pleased with himself.
"Leo," Jay said.
"Jay," Leo said warmly. "You look fantastic."
"You said a hundred people. Close friends. Small gathering."
"Did I?"
"Yes."
"Hm. Must have miscounted."
"There are at least five hundred people here. This isn't a party. It's a gala."
"It's a celebration," Leo corrected.
"There are politicians here. Clients. I saw someone from the finance ministry."
"Ian knows a lot of people."
"This is ridiculous. You said small. You said intimate. You said—"
"Look around," Leo interrupted, gesturing to the room.
Jay stopped talking and actually looked.
The venue was massive—chandeliers dripping with crystal, floral arrangements that must've cost thousands, a string quartet playing near the far wall. The guest list was drawn from every tier of power and influence. Politicians, business leaders, old money families. But also artists, writers, people in extravagant clothing who clearly didn't care what anyone thought.
A surprising number of people were unabashedly, flamboyantly queer—men in glittering jackets, women in sharp suits, couples holding hands.
Jay had expected something elegant and restrained. Instead, this was Ian's actual world—enormous, distinguished, glittering. Unapologetic.
Jay's nerves spiked. He was so far out of his depth here. These were people who belonged in spaces like this, who moved through such events with natural grace. And Jay was just someone who'd needed a clothing clerk to tell him how to dress appropriately.
Then he stopped himself. This was Ian's world. Of course it looked like this. Of course Ian moved in circles that were massive and complicated and full of people who lived lives Jay couldn't even imagine. That didn't mean Jay didn't belong here. It meant he had to live up to the occasion.
He took a breath and turned back to Leo. "Fine."
Leo smiled. "See? Not so bad."
"It's terrifying," Jay said.
"You'll be fine."
Jay found Ian by the buffet table, momentarily alone. He approached quickly, before someone else could claim Ian's attention.
"Ian, I'm sorry," Jay said.
Ian looked at him, surprised. "For what?"
"For pushing the party idea. I didn't realize it would be this big. This formal. If I'd known—"
"Jay, stop."
"But you're tense. I can see it."
"I'm always tense at these things. But it's fine. I'm used to it. This isn't so different from charity galas or industry events. Just with more people I actually like."
"You're sure?"
"I'm sure."
Before Jay could respond, a group of guests approached—older men, clearly friends from Ian's past. They swept Ian into conversation, and Jay stepped back, letting him go.
Jay drifted between circles, checking on Ema every fifteen minutes, talking with his coworkers. The team had scattered throughout the venue, each finding their own corner. He found Rin clinging to Luc like a lifeline near the edge of the dance floor.
"You okay?" Jay asked.
"Too many people," Rin muttered.
"You'll survive," Luc said cheerfully. "Just breathe."
Ela and Kim were on the dance floor, laughing and spinning. Even Ray was there, standing stiffly near the wall with a glass of wine, looking like someone had forced him to attend at gunpoint. Jay suspected Leo might actually have threatened him. It was the only explanation.
Max, Amy, and Liv had brought their spouses. Max's wife wore loads of jewellery and laughed as loudly as Max did. Amy's husband looked serious and vaguely unhappy to be there. Liv's husband surprised Jay—long hair, multiple piercings, an air of mild boredom. They stood in a group of six, chatting animatedly.
Zoe stood in a corner chatting with a group of people who were aggressively, gloriously flamboyant—sequins, bold makeup. She looked completely at ease. Tia stood near the bar with a glass of whiskey, looking slightly awkward.
"Tia," Jay said.
"Jay," she said, relieved. "Thank god. I don't know anyone here."
"You know me," Jay said. "Come on."
He led Tia over to where Rus and Van stood guard over the girls. Ema and Lam were still chattering excitedly, but Rus and Van looked like sentries on duty.
"Tia, this is Rus and Van. They're friends. You all have military backgrounds. You'll get along."
Tia's expression brightened immediately. "You were in the service?"
They launched into conversation immediately, trading stories about bases and deployments and the particular insanity of military logistics. Tia's awkwardness vanished within minutes.
Jay turned back to the dance floor and froze.
Luc had Ema on the dance floor, spinning her around, laughing. Mic was entertaining Lam nearby, gesturing wildly while she giggled. Jay shot them both pointed glances.
Rus appeared at his side. "Relax. Luc's harmless. And Mic might be a menace, but he wouldn't go after little girls."
"You're sure?"
"Positive. They're just having fun."
Jay watched for another moment. Rus was right. Luc was being perfectly appropriate, just friendly. And Mic, despite his reputation, kept a respectful distance from Lam.
Still, Jay didn't relax. 
The party was loud, lively, full of laughter and music. People danced. People talked. People drank champagne and ate from the elaborate buffet. And Jay moved through it all, keeping track of everyone, making sure Ema and Lam were safe, checking that the team was comfortable, watching Ian from across the room whenever he could.
He didn't relax for a second. He couldn't shake the feeling that if something went wrong, it would somehow be his fault.
Scene 4
Not boyfriend
At ten, the lights dimmed. A hush fell over the crowd as staff wheeled out the cake.
It was monumental. Excessive. Four tiers of dark chocolate, decorated with sugar flowers that looked too delicate to be real. The crowd pressed closer, phones appearing to capture the moment.
Then the fireworks started.
Jay hadn't expected fireworks. Nobody had mentioned fireworks. But suddenly the patio doors were thrown open, and the night sky erupted in colour—gold, silver, red, cascading patterns that lit up the entire venue.
The crowd gasped, applauded, cheered. Jay stood frozen, watching the display, feeling the absurdity of it all. This wasn't a birthday party. This was a spectacle.
When the fireworks ended, a figure stepped onto the small stage. Jay recognized them immediately—everyone did. A vaudeville star, legendary in certain circles, someone whose name appeared in theater programs and cultural retrospectives. They smiled, raised their arms theatrically, and began singing.
"Happy birthday to you..."
Half the guests squealed. Actual squealing. Jay watched in disbelief as grown adults reacted like they'd just seen their favorite celebrity. Which, he supposed, they had.
The song ended to thunderous applause. Then the stage lights came up fully, revealing an entire orchestra—not the small string quartet from earlier, but a full ensemble. They launched into a sweeping, theatrical piece, and the crowd erupted again.
Ian stood near the center of the patio, looking uncomfortable and vaguely trapped, but when the song ended, he smiled and raised his glass in acknowledgement.
Ray escaped shortly after the cake. Jay spotted him slipping toward the exit, relief visible on his face even from across the room. Jay didn't blame him. He was half-tempted to flee himself.
But he had responsibilities. Ema, the team, Ian, so he stayed.
As the night continued, the atmosphere loosened. Couples drifted into corners, old friends reunited with animated conversation, the music swelled and changed to something more lively. 
Jay checked on Ian repeatedly. Each time he approached, Ian's expression brightened—just slightly, just enough for Jay to notice.
"How are you holding up?" Jay asked during one check-in.
"Surviving."
"That's all we can ask."
Ian almost smiled. "How's Ema?"
"Thriving. I think she's having the time of her life."
"Good. That's good."
Someone called Ian's name from across the room, and he was pulled away again. Jay watched him go, then returned to his orbit—checking guests, monitoring the atmosphere, ensuring everything ran smoothly.
At eleven-thirty, Jay was near a group of Ian's old friends—elegant people in their forties and fifties, holding wine glasses. One of them spotted Jay and smiled. "You must be Jay."
"I am."
"Ian's told us about you. Though he didn't mention how spectacular you are. Your new boyfriend is very impressive, Ian."
Jay went scarlet. "I'm not—we're not—"
"Jay is my assistant. Not my boyfriend."
The friend laughed, delighted. "Oh, my apologies. Well then, are you available? Because if Ian's foolish enough not to claim you, I'd be delighted to—"
Jay felt his face burn hotter. "I'm absolutely not."
The words came out more forcefully than he intended. The friend raised his hands in mock surrender, still smiling. "Fair enough. Can't blame me for asking."
Ian wanted to excuse himself. He wanted to pull Jay into some secluded corner and kiss him breathless. He wanted to do a hundred things he'd never be allowed to do. The thought sent a sharp pain through his entire body.
Around midnight, Jay spotted Eli in the crowd. He was looking thrilled to be there, and when he saw Jay, he immediately approached.
"Jay! This is incredible. Thank you so much for the invitation."
"I'm glad you like it."
"Are you kidding? This is the event of the season. Everyone's talking about it." Eli gestured to the room. "The orchestra, the fireworks, the guest list—it's spectacular."
"Leo went all out."
"He certainly did. I should thank your employer. For allowing me to attend."
"Come on, I'll introduce you."
Jay found Ian near the bar and brought Eli over. "Ian, this is Eli. He's the stylist who helped with my outfit tonight."
Ian extended his hand. "A pleasure. You did excellent work."
Eli shook his hand, looking slightly starstruck. "Thank you, Mr. Hagen. It was my honor. Jay was already a perfect canvas—I just helped him shine."
"You succeeded admirably."
Eli practically glowed. "If you ever need styling services, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'd be delighted to assist."
"I'll keep that in mind."
He departed with a final nod to Jay.
"The acquaintance you mentioned?" Ian asked.
"Yes. He's helped me multiple times with styling advice. I wanted to thank him."
"By bringing him to my birthday party."
"Is that alright? I know I should have asked more specifically—"
"It's fine. You're thoughtful about the people who help you. That's characteristic."
Before Jay could respond, a woman in an expensive gown approached—apparently a city councillor who wanted to discuss potential new projects. Ian was pulled back into conversation, and Jay stepped away to give them space.
Across the room, Ema and Lam had found a table full of flamboyant men who were absolutely delighted by their Victorian gowns. Jay watched as they launched into an animated discussion about makeup techniques, historical fashion, and the best ways to achieve dramatic effects.
The men were patient, enthusiastic, treating the girls like fellow enthusiasts. Ema was asking questions, showing photos on her phone, absorbing every piece of advice.
Jay checked with Rus, who was still standing guard nearby.
"They're fine. Theatre people, I think. They're having a blast."
"As long as they're safe."
"They're safe. Stop worrying."
Jay tried to take the advice. He really did.
The night continued, endless and exhausting. Jay kept orbiting Ian, drawn back to him again and again even as the crowd kept them apart. Each time their eyes met across the room, something passed between them—acknowledgment, reassurance, connection.
They barely spoke. There was no time, too many guests demanding Ian's attention. But Jay felt the pull anyway, the invisible thread that kept bringing him back.
Ian noticed the orbits. Jay could tell by the way Ian's gaze tracked him, by the way Ian's expression eased slightly whenever Jay came into view. Like Jay mattered. Like it made the night slightly more bearable.
At two in the morning, the party was still going, though the crowd had thinned. Jay finally gathered Ema and Lam, who were exhausted but exhilarated.
"That was the best night of my life," Ema said, leaning heavily on Jay as they walked to the car.
"I'm glad."
"Everyone was so nice. And the dresses, and the dancing, and those men who talked about makeup—Jay, it was perfect."
"I'm happy you enjoyed it."
Lam was quieter, but her face glowed. "Thank you for bringing us."
"Of course."
During the taxi ride home Ema and Lam dozed against each other in the back seat. Jay stared out the window. They'd survived. The party had been a success. Ema was happy. Nobody had been hurt or disappointed.
Back at his apartment, the girls stumbled to the bedroom with mumbled goodnight. He texted his mother: "Evening went perfectly. Everyone behaved. The girls had an amazing time. We're home safe."
He removed his outfit, hanging everything carelessly, too tired to do more than basic care, then collapsed onto the couch, bone-tired but still wired from the evening.
Scene 5
You deserve every good thing
Ian arrived home at four in the morning, drained and irritated.
The party had been too much. The attention suffocating. The splendour absurd. Five hundred people wishing him well, wanting his time. The cake, the fireworks, the orchestra—all of it excessive beyond reason.
But Jay… Jay had looked beautiful. Devastating. Walking down those stairs like something out of a dream.
Jay had kept coming back to him, checking on him, seeking him out even in the crush of the crowd. Jay had rejected everyone else who approached him, every subtle and not-so-subtle advance deflected with a simple, definitive no.
Ian dropped his keys on the counter and looked around his living room.
The gifts were already there, arranged by the staff Leo had hired to handle the logistics. Elegant boxes, wrapped packages, things chosen by assistants or purchased out of obligation. Ian ignored all of them and went straight to the one that mattered. The silver-and-gold package with the red ribbon. Jay's gift. The ribbons Jay had chosen made it distinctive among the more elaborate presentations. Ian took it to his kitchen table and sat, just looking at it for a long moment.
Then he unwrapped it, preserving the ribbons, revealing a beautiful wooden box beneath. He opened it to find three crystal bottles and a handwritten note. Ian picked it up and read.
Ian,
I made these for you. Each one for a different moment:
The first—citrus, ginger, cardamom. For cold evenings when you need warmth.
The second—alpine herbs, gentian, chamomile. For when you're tired and need clarity.
The third—red currant, cinnamon, honey. This one reminded me of my childhood. My grandfather made something similar. I hope it brings you comfort. 
Happy birthday. You deserve every good thing.
—Jay
Ian read it twice, then a third time, tracing the handwriting with his eyes.
Each one tailored to him. Each one infused with meaning. He picked up the bottle of red currant tincture and opened it. He poured a small amount into a glass and took a sip.
It was sweet and warm, just like Jay. Rich with spice and fruit, smooth on the tongue.
Ian closed his eyes and let the warmth spread through him. It probably tastes like his lips, Ian thought, and the thought hit him with such sharp longing that he had to set the glass down. 
He fell asleep on the couch, still holding the note, glowing despite the exhaustion. The evening wasn't so bad after all.
Ian slept in the next day. He woke at noon to someone knocking persistently on his door. Ian dragged himself upright, disoriented and annoyed, and went to answer it. Leo stood in the hallway.
"Good morning, sunshine."
"What do you want?"
"Just checking on the birthday boy. Making sure you survived the festivities."
"I'm fine. Go away."
"Let me in. I brought coffee."
Ian considered closing the door in his face. But Leo was already pushing past him, carrying two cups from the café down the street.
"You look terrible," Leo said cheerfully, handing him a cup.
"I was asleep."
"At noon? That's not like you."
"I got home at four."
"Fair enough. So. What did you think?"
"It was excessive."
"It was great."
"It was too much, Leo. Five hundred people—"
"Who all care about you. Who all wanted to celebrate you. Stop being ungrateful."
"Fine. It was impressive. Thank you."
"Better. Now, let me try one of Jay's tinctures."
"No."
"Come on. Just a taste."
"Absolutely not."
"Ian—"
"No. They're mine."
Leo laughed, delighted. "You're being territorial. How charming."
"They're a gift. I'm not sharing."
"Fine, fine. But you should know—Jay made those with so much care. Months of trial and error. He turned his entire apartment into a laboratory. Probably three dozen batches before he settled on the final versions. You should have seen him guarding those jars like a dragon protecting treasure. He wouldn't let me sample anything. It was adorable."
"He didn't need to go to that much effort."
"Of course he did. He adores you."
"Leo—"
"You know, I'm surprised you two haven't consummated your obvious union yet."
"Get out," Ian said.
"I'm just saying—"
"Leo."
"Fine, fine. Though really, Ian. The way he looks at you. The way you look at him. It's rather remarkable that you've both maintained this facade."
Ian physically moved Leo toward the door. "Out."
Leo left clearly pleased with himself.
Ian stood in the quiet afterwards, holding the bottle Jay had made for him, feeling undeserving and overwhelmingly lucky.
Leo's unsavoury comments about consummation were ridiculous—Jay's intentions were almost certainly not that carnal. But the sweetness was there regardless. The gentle, tender care that made Ian's chest constrict painfully. He set the bottle down and wondered what he'd done to deserve someone like Jay in his life.
Jay woke up Sunday morning to the sound of the girls already awake and eager to explore.
"Can we go shopping?" Ema asked the moment Jay opened his eyes.
"It's eight in the morning," Jay said.
"Exactly. The stores will be open soon."
Jay sighed and made coffee.
They went shopping. Ema and Lam dragged him through half a dozen stores, exclaiming over clothes and makeup and accessories they couldn't afford but loved looking at. Jay bought them each something small. 
By early afternoon, Leo's driver arrived to take them home. The girls hugged Jay tightly, still buzzing with excitement.
"Thank you, Jay. This was the best weekend of my life."
"You're welcome."
"Will you visit us soon?"
"I'll try."
They climbed into the car, waving through the window as they pulled away. Jay watched them go, feeling exhausted. The weekend was over. The party was done. Now he had to face the aftermath.
He walked home slowly, thinking about Ian. The evening had been much more stressful than he'd thought. The scale, the crowd, the noise—it had been ridiculous. He couldn't shake the feeling that he'd done something wrong.
He'd wanted to bring joy into Ian's life. Instead, he'd brought a spectacle. He'd pushed Ian into the centre of attention, exactly where Ian didn't want to be. He'd turned a simple birthday into a massive, exhausting production. He was sure Ian was unhappy about that. Jay closed his eyes and sighed deeply. He'd have to make it up to him somehow. Apologize. Do something to fix whatever damage he'd caused.
