Chapter 44: Afterglow
Scene 1
Early darkness
The fluorescent lights felt particularly harsh on Monday morning. Jay arrived at his desk skittish, bracing himself for whatever reaction Ian might have to the party. The weekend had been a spectacular excess, and now here he was again, surrounded by monitors and spreadsheets and the ordinary machinery of work.
Ian appeared at eight and walked past Jay's desk without stopping.
"Good morning."
"Good morning," Jay said.
That was all. Ian disappeared into his office, and Jay turned back to his screen, uncertain. He couldn’t tell whether Ian seemed annoyed or if he was projecting his own doubts onto him.
The morning workload was unusually heavy. Client requests needed immediate attention, and two international calls were scheduled before ten. The morning briefing was brief—squeezed between Ian's first and second call—and consisted mostly of Jay rattling off urgent items.
When they were done Jay left the office and returned to his desk. Ian looked exhausted. He was trying to hide it, but Jay could see the weariness, the strain. He wanted to talk to Ian. To explain, to apologize, to make amends for the spectacle of the party, but the workday consumed them both.
By noon, Jay had barely spoken to Ian again. The international calls ran long, and then there was an emergency meeting about a client complaint. At lunch, Jay joined the team at a nearby restaurant. The party was the main topic immediately.
"I'm telling you, the fireworks were overkill, but in the best possible way. Leo doesn't do anything by halves," Luc said. 
"The cake was incredible. I didn't even know they made cakes that tall," Ela added.
"Did you see the ice sculpture? It was an actual phoenix. How do you even carve that?" Kim asked.
Amy smiled. "My husband even admitted he enjoyed it. That's saying something."
"You looked good, Jay. Where did you even get that outfit? It was stunning," Liv asked.
"Thanks, a stylist helped me."
"Well, they knew what they were doing."
The conversation moved on, dissecting other details of the party—the orchestra, the guest list. Everyone agreed it had been a success. Jay listened and nodded and tried to feel reassured by that, but his thoughts kept returning to Ian's expression when the cake had been wheeled out. The way he'd stood there surrounded by five hundred people and looked miserable.
"You alright?" Luc asked.
Jay realized he'd been staring at his untouched sandwich. "Yeah. Just tired."
"It was a long weekend. I'm still recovering too."
The afternoon dragged. Ian's calls continued, one bleeding into the next, and Jay worked through spreadsheets and reports, trying not to watch the clock. By six, most of the office had cleared out. By seven, it was just him and Ian left on the floor.
Finally Jay got up and walked to Ian's office. The door was open. Ian was at his desk, typing something frantically. Jay knocked lightly on the door frame.
Ian looked up. "Yes?"
"Do you need anything else tonight?"
"No, I'm nearly finished here. You can head out if you'd like."
"Actually, I wanted to apologize."
"For what?"
"For the party. I should have pushed back more when Leo started planning everything. I didn't realize how out of hand it would get."
"Leo doesn't take well to being pushed back."
"I know, but still. Five hundred people and fireworks and a vaudeville star—it was too much. I'm sorry. I just—it got out of hand. I know you hate those kinds of events, and Leo turned it into a circus, and I should have—"
"You didn't force me to attend my own birthday party."
"No, but I encouraged it. And now you're stuck with—I don't know, a mountain of gifts you didn't want and probably a headache that hasn't gone away yet."
"Jay. I agreed to the party. I knew what Leo would do with it. You are not responsible for his excess."
"I wanted you to enjoy it. But you just looked tired."
"I was tired. Though I'll admit the aftermath is proving worse than the event itself."
"Aftermath?"
"My living room is now a warehouse. Gifts. Everywhere. I can't walk through it without tripping over something."
"You haven't unpacked them?"
"I opened yours. The rest can wait. Indefinitely, if I'm honest. The entire prospect depresses me."
"I can help with that. Next weekend isn't too busy for me. I can come over and sort everything out. Catalogue it, write thank-you notes if you want, whatever you need."
"You don't have to do that."
"I want to. It's my fault you're buried in gifts anyway."
"It's Leo's fault," Ian corrected, but he didn't argue further. "If you're offering, I won't refuse. Saturday afternoon?"
"That works."
"Good. Thank you, Jay."
"Of course."
Jay left the office feeling better. It wasn't much, but at least he could fix this one thing.
Tuesday's run started in the early evening, just as the sun was setting. The air was even cooler than it had been the week before, autumn asserting itself properly now. Jay pulled his jacket tighter as they started along the river path, and by the time they hit the halfway point, the light was almost gone.
They stopped near the water, both breathing hard. The air in front of them turned to fog with every exhale. Ian bent forward slightly, hands on his knees, and then straightened.
"It's getting dark earlier," Ian said.
"And colder. The weather was much more pleasant this time last year," Jay added.
Ian looked out at the river, where the last traces of daylight were fading. "We should probably pause these until spring. Running in the dark isn't ideal, and the temperature's only going to drop from here."
"Yeah, that makes sense."
"Reporting season starts soon anyway. We won't have the time."
"True."
They stood there for a moment longer, neither moving. The tradition had only been going for a few weeks, but it had become something Jay looked forward to. A reason to spend time with Ian outside the office that didn't require a business excuse.
"Spring, then," Jay said finally.
"Spring," Ian agreed.
When yhey walked back, the cold was biting at their exposed skin.
Thursday afternoon, Jay's phone rang with the car salesman's number.
"I'm still working on finding the right vehicle for your budget and specifications. I'll need another week, maybe a bit more."
"How much more?"
"Hard to say. The market's been tight lately, but I'll keep looking. I haven't let Mr. Hagen down yet, and I don't plan to start now."
"Alright. Thank you."
He hung up and stared at his calendar. Tim's birthday was in mid-October, and the quarter ended soon. Once reporting season hit, Jay's schedule would be a nightmare. He needed this sorted before then, but there wasn't much he could do except wait and hope the salesman's track record held.
Friday evening, Ian appeared at Jay's desk at seven o'clock.
"Ready?" he asked, as if there'd been any question about whether they'd have their weekly dinner.
"Yeah. Where are we going?" 
"That place near the canal." 
"The one with the brick oven?" 
"That's the one."
They didn't discuss further. The Friday dinners had resumed without needing to be renegotiated, slipping back into place as though the party weekend interruption never happened. Ian drove them to the restaurant with wooden tables and a menu that leaned toward game.
They ordered drinks first, and then Ian asked about the car search. Jay explained the delay, and Ian frowned slightly.
"He's reliable. If he says he needs more time, it's because he's being thorough."
"I know. I just—Tim's birthday is coming up, and I wanted to have it sorted before reporting season starts."
"You'll have it sorted. Even if it cuts close."
Jay nodded, trying to believe that.
They talked about work, the upcoming reports. Ian mentioned that Leo was already making noises about the annual gala, which wasn't until January but apparently required months of planning.
When the food arrived, Jay looked down at his plate with mild apprehension. He'd ordered something the waiter recommended, rabbit stew with juniper and chestnuts. The first bite was stronger than he'd expected, rich and almost too gamey, the flavor violently hitting the back of his throat.
He chewed and swallowed, trying not to grimace.
Ian was watching him, and the corner of his mouth lifted. "How is it?"
"It's... interesting."
"You hate it."
"I don't hate it."
"You don't have to finish it."
"I'm not going to waste it."
"Jay, it's food, not a moral failing."
Jay took another bite, forcing himself to chew and swallow. The taste didn't improve and the texture was dense, but he wasn't about to leave half a meal on his plate. Ian was definitely amused now, which only made Jay more determined to finish.
By the time the plate was empty, Jay felt slightly queasy, but at least it was done. Ian was still smiling, the faint kind of smile that softened his whole face.
"You're stubborn," Ian said.
"I don't like wasting things."
"Even when they taste like that?"
"Even then."
Ian shook his head, but he still looked amused. They finished their drinks and left, stepping out into the cool evening air. Ian drove Jay home, and they confirmed their plans for Saturday as the car idled outside Jay's building.
"Two o'clock?" Ian asked.
"I'll be there."
"Good. Thank you again for doing this."
"It's not a problem. Really."
He got out of the car and walked to the entrance, glancing back once to see Ian still waiting until he was inside. Jay waved, and Ian pulled away.
Scene 2
Thoughtful gifts
Jay arrived at Ian's building at exactly two o'clock. The lobby was as imposing as ever. The doorman recognized him now and waved him through without question, but Jay still felt discomfort every time he walked through those doors. This wasn't his world, no matter how many times Ian insisted otherwise.
Ian answered the door almost immediately, dressed in dark trousers and a plain sweater, more casual than Jay expected.
"Come in. Fair warning, it's worse than I described."
Jay stepped inside and stopped. The living room was unrecognizable. Wrapped boxes were stacked everywhere, covering the couch, the coffee table, even parts of the floor. Ribbons and bows and elegant wrapping paper in every conceivable colour.
"Oh," Jay said.
"Yes. Oh. I've been walking around them all week. It's humiliating."
"It's not that bad."
"It's a monument to wealth and excess. People trying to impress me with expensive nonsense I don't want or need."
"We'll sort it out."
"Thank you. I don't think I could've faced this alone."
"We need a system. Sorting first, then unwrapping, then logging who gave what so you can send thank-you notes."
Ian looked at the mountain of presents, then at Jay. "That's going to take hours."
"Then we'd better start."
They set up on the floor, clearing a space in the centre of the room. Ian passed boxes over, while Jay organized them into rough categories by size. It felt strangely intimate—sitting close together on the carpet, surrounded by wrapping paper.
Ian made commentary about each giver. "That's from the Wilsons. They always give crystal. I think they own stock in a glassware company."
Jay unwrapped an elaborate vase. "It's nice crystal, at least."
"It's the fourth vase they've given me."
"What do you do with four vases?"
"Regift them."
They continued. Box after box, gift after gift. Some were thoughtful—uncommon books, quality liquor, things clearly chosen with care. Most were generic—gift baskets, accessories, items selected by assistants, expensive but impersonal. Some were just terrible.
"What is this?" Jay held up a gold-plated pen holder shaped like a swan.
Ian stared at it. "I have no idea."
"It's hideous."
"Put it in the donation pile."
Halfway through the pile, Jay unwrapped a package to find a hoodie with a gym logo and an envelope. He read the card aloud.
"From Rus and the company. It says you need to unwind more. Take your assistant to the sauna and show him how it's done properly. Included: two-person exclusive sauna package voucher. That's—they didn't need to—"
"They're unexpectedly thoughtful. I didn't expect a sauna package."
"I have the same hoodie. I got it at the gym for my one-year anniversary. Now we have matching hoodies."
"That's nice."
Jay set the hoodie aside, still flustered. Matching hoodies. He doubted Ian would ever wear it, but the idea still made his heart race. 
The next gift was a slim envelope, decorated with stickers and hearts. Jay opened it and groaned.
"What is it?" Ian asked.
"From Ema and Lam. Tickets for a spring botanical garden night. In the city where I went to university. They say I can show you around and you'll definitely love it."
Jay felt his face burn. The gift was sweet, and the wishes were cheesy and enthusiastic, but it felt mildly inappropriate, like a thing you gave to a couple, not to a boss and his assistant. He glanced at Ian, ready to apologize for his sister's presumption.
Ian was staring at the ticket, his expression unexpectedly bright.
"A botanical garden at night. I've always wanted to go to something like this, but the opportunity never presented itself. If you're comfortable with it, I'd very much like to go."
"Really?"
"It's novel. Different. But only if you're alright with it. I know it's asking you to take time and travel."
"Of course I'm willing. I just didn't think you'd want to."
"I do. Very much."
Ian set the tickets aside in a spot where they wouldn't get lost. Internally, he was praising Ema for engineering such a perfect excuse for a weekend with Jay. The girl was a genius. This was even better than the sauna voucher from Rus.
The next box was ornate, wrapped in gold paper with an absurdly large bow.
"Oh my god," Jay said.
Inside, nestled in layers of velvet, was an antique brooch. It was enormous, the size of Jay's palm, with intricate gold filigree and a sapphire in the centre so large it looked fake. Except it wasn't fake. It was absolutely, unmistakably real. Gaudy, extravagant, absolutely ridiculous.
"It's from Leo." 
Jay stared at it. Then he started laughing. He couldn't help it. The absurdity of the thing, the sheer ridiculousness of Leo spending two weeks hunting for this monstrosity across multiple countries, all while Jay had been agonizing over whether his homemade tinctures were good enough. He laughed until his sides hurt, collapsing back against the couch.
Ian looked unamused. "It's probably insanely expensive."
"It's hideous."
Jay rolled on the floor, still laughing. "He made me so anxious. I thought my gift was going to look pathetic next to whatever he found, and he comes back with this."
Ian picked up the brooch, examining it critically. "Your gift was better."
Jay sat up, wiping his eyes. "You're just saying that."
"I'm not. Your gift was the best. Well, second best. Right after your sister's gift."
They continued working through the pile, boxes opened, gifts logged, wrapping paper collected into bags. By the time they finished, two empty coffee cups sat on the table, and they were both sprawled on the floor amid the debris.
"I'm sorry this was such a hassle," Jay said.
"You've apologized enough."
"I feel responsible."
"If you truly want to make it up to me, take vacation time without grimacing."
Jay groaned. "Not this again."
"You need rest. You should plan it as penance for the party."
"I'm not going unless you take time off too."
"Spending a week at home is depressing. I don't want to do it."
"Then don't spend it at home."
"I don't have anywhere to go."
They reached a standstill, both stubborn, neither willing to budge. Jay lay on the floor, staring at the ceiling, and felt the comfortable domesticity of the moment—the warmth, the feeling that he could say anything.
"What if—what if I plan a trip, and you come with me? Would you consider taking time off then?"
"You want to travel together?"
"I mean, I'm your assistant. Planning a vacation is practically administrative work."
"That's—I suppose that's reasonable."
"So you'd consider it?"
"I'd reluctantly agree. For your sake. Since you insist."
But Ian's tone was anything but reluctant. He sounded almost eager.
"November? After reporting season ends," Jay proposed.
"That works."
"I'll look for options. Maybe somewhere warm. And with good food."
"I trust your judgement."
They lay there for another moment, both smiling at the ceiling, surrounded by the wreckage of the afternoon. Jay felt absurdly happy. They had the botanical garden trip in spring. They had a vacation in November. So many things to look forward to.
Ian stood and stretched, surveying the now-organized stacks of gifts, and then looked at Jay.
"Stay for dinner. It's the least I can do after making you work all afternoon."
"You didn't make me—"
"Stay anyway."
Jay followed him to the kitchen and sat at the counter, watching Ian move around, chopping vegetables, heating oil, assembling ingredients. The food smelled amazing. Jay's mouth watered as Ian plated two servings and brought them to the table.
"This looks incredible," Jay said.
"Try it before you compliment it."
Jay took a bite. It was delicious.
"You're an amazing cook."
"I'm glad you like it."
It was late by the time Jay left, stepping out into the cool night air. He walked home, already thinking about where they might go in November. Somewhere they could both relax. Somewhere they could spend time together, just the two of them. The thought made him smile all the way home.
Scene 3
Smooth sailing
Jay spent all of Sunday browsing holiday options. He made lists, compared destinations, took notes on activities Ian might enjoy. Places with active ways to spend time—hiking, water sports, cultural sites. Preferably seaside, somewhere warm in November.
And only the absolute top hotels, places Ian would actually want to stay in. Jay looked at the prices and felt his stomach twist, but he pushed the feeling aside. It didn't matter if he had to bankrupt himself. He'd ensure Ian got the best possible experience.
By evening, he had a shortlist of possibilities and a notebook full of details.
Monday was hectic—the last day of September, everyone rushing to finish current tasks before the reporting season began. Jay stayed late, buried in assignments, and barely had time to talk to Ian beyond their morning briefing.
When he finally left at eight, Ian was still at his desk, surrounded by documents. They exchanged a look, Jay hesitating at the door, but there was nothing to say. The quarter was ending. This was normal.
Tuesday, the quarterly reports began.
Day one was preliminary—gathering data, downloading files, sorting through sources. Tedious, time-consuming work that kept everyone at their desks until late evening. Except this time, they finished by four.
Liv and Ray worked like an unstoppable machine. Ray especially—he tore through assignments like a robot, producing virtually flawless work at incredible speed. By the time Jay checked in at three, they were already tackling tasks scheduled for the next day.
Jay stared at his screen, disbelieving. "We're ahead of schedule."
"Way ahead," Luc confirmed, looking equally stunned.
Wednesday was supposed to be the worst day—assembling and reconciling countless rows of numbers, validating data, fixing errors, the boring, grinding work that kept them in the office until midnight. But by three in the afternoon, they were done, moving on to additional assignments with time to spare.
Rin made himself useful, running files between desks, double-checking calculations. Tia adapted quickly, following Rin's lead and staying out of the way when needed.
No overtime. No disasters. No one sleeping in the office.
Ian and Jay almost didn't know what to do with themselves. That evening, they organized tea in the lounge. The office was emptying out—people actually leaving at reasonable hours—and Ian and Jay sat at one of the small tables with cups of tea and Jay's laptop.
"This one has great hiking trails," Jay said, pointing at the screen. "And this one has historical sites nearby. Both are warm in November."
 "What about seaside?"
"All of them are coastal."
"Show me the hotels."
Jay clicked through options. Ian made suggestions, pointing out features he liked—private beaches, good restaurants, proximity to activities.
"This seems expensive," Jay said, hesitating over one particular resort.
"Cost doesn't matter. Leo pays, and you're going as my assistant to coordinate activities. It shouldn't even count as vacation."
Jay couldn't really argue with that. It had been his suggestion, after all. "Alright. I'll look at the top-tier options."
The reports continued their unprecedented smooth progress. Tasks that required weekend work were finished by Friday afternoon. Ray left each day at four, having bludgeoned through enormous portions of work, leaving everyone staring after him in disbelief.
Friday, Ian had an urgent regulatory matter that kept him late. Jay stayed until eight, helping where he could, but eventually had to leave Ian buried in legal documents he couldn't assist with.  At eight, Jay packed his things. He stopped by Ian's office.
"I'm heading out."
"Sorry about dinner."
"It's fine. You have work to do."
"This is going to take all weekend."
"I figured."
They looked at each other for a moment. Jay wanted to say something—hat he'd miss their dinner more than was reasonable—but he just said, "Good night."
"Good night, Jay."
Jay had expected this, prepared for it mentally, but it still left him feeling gloomy as he walked home alone.
Saturday, Jay went to the gym and tried to sweat out the misery. Rus noticed immediately.
"What's got you wound up?"
"Nothing. Just—work stuff."
"Work stuff that has you murdering the rowing machine?"
Jay stopped, breathing hard. "Fine. Your gift. What were you thinking? Take your assistant to the sauna? That's completely inappropriate."
Rus burst out laughing. "Oh my god. You're actually upset about that?"
"It's—it's weird! You can't just—"
"It's hilarious. You're pouting."
"I'm not pouting."
When Rus finally caught his breath, he wiped his eyes. "I'm glad work is less stressful, at least. Seems like Ian took my complaints to heart."
"It's the expanded staff. Liv and Ray are incredible. We're ahead of schedule for the first time ever."
"Good. You deserve a break."
Jay nodded, but the gloom lingered. Work was easier, but that didn't fix the disappointment of the missed Friday dinner.
The following week was equally easy. All emergencies were handled as they appeared, everything proceeding at express speed. The team even resumed their lunch outings—there was no reason not to, given they were on track to finish a day before deadline with no overtime whatsoever.
Jay didn't need to stay late either, but he did. Because evenings had become holiday planning time.
On Tuesday, they finalized the details. The Songbird Islands, first half of November. A royal suite in a cliff-side five-star hotel, with a view of the ocean and access to private beaches.
"This is it. Ten days. First half of November," Jay said. 
"Book it."
Jay pulled out the company card, looking at it like it might bite him. "Aren't we technically defrauding company funds?"
"Leo will survive. He spent millions on that ridiculous brooch. He can endure a couple thousand more for a decent hotel."
"This is more than a couple thousand."
"Book it, Jay."
Jay took a breath and entered the payment information. Ten days. Longer than he'd expected Ian to agree to.
They finished the reports on Wednesday. Everything triple-checked, quadruple-checked, every file polished to perfection. The team sat in stunned silence, looking at their completed work.
"We're done," Amy said, disbelieving.
"Actually done," Max confirmed.
Tia looked impressed. "Is it always like this?"
"No," Luc said immediately. "It's never like this. Normally we're all half-dead by now."
Thursday afternoon, Leo appeared in the office doorway, looking pleased with himself. He clapped his hands together, and the room went quiet.
"Attention, everyone. The promised hot springs trip will take place the last weekend of October. Three days, two nights, all expenses paid. Mark your calendars."
A cheer went through the office. Jay sat at his desk, frozen. His brain supplied an extremely vivid image of Ian in a bathrobe, and he nearly dropped his pen. The intrusive thought made him blush furiously. He ducked his head, pretending to organize papers, hoping no one noticed.
Thankfully, everyone was too busy celebrating to pay attention.
The quarterly party was on Friday. It was held at an elegant venue, perfectly beautiful and tastefully decorated, the atmosphere cheerful and low-stress. Rin and Tia didn't look nervous at all, seasoned now by Ian's birthday extravaganza. Ray was absent—clearly, whatever threats Leo had used before had lost their efficacy.
Jay kept drifting to Ian's side throughout the evening. They talked about work, about the upcoming hot-springs trip. It was comfortable, and yet—
Yet Jay felt the undercurrent of disappointment. The party was nice, but it was the second Friday dinner in a row that didn't happen, and that felt bad. And even though the circumstances were understandable, even though work had gone well, the absence of those evenings still left an ache.
They had so much to look forward to, so many plans, so many promises of time together, but right in this moment, Jay missed the feeling of having Ian's full attention.
Ian was talking to Amy when Jay approached, but he turned immediately.
"Enjoying yourself?" Ian asked.
"It's nice."
"But?"
"Nothing. It's a good party."
Jay had the uncomfortable sense that Ian could see straight through him, but Ian didn't press, just nodded and turned back to the conversation.
They saw each other every day, worked side by side, planned trips together, and yet Jay missed him desperately.
Scene 4
Lovesick
Saturday at the gym was miserable. Jay pushed himself, but his mood dragged behind him like a weight. Rus noticed immediately.
"Still mad about the gift?" Rus asked.
"What? No."
"Then what's wrong?"
"The car salesman is taking forever. Tim's birthday is next weekend and I still don't have the car."
"He'll come through."
"What if he doesn't?"
"He will."
Rus tried to engage him in conversation, but Jay gave monosyllabic answers until Rus finally left him alone.
The rest of the weekend was worse. Jay stayed home, flipping through television channels, scrolling through his phone. He told himself there was nothing wrong. Work was good. The vacation was booked. Everything was fine. The car will be ready on time.
But it didn't feel fine.
Jay was at his desk by eight on Monday, working through emails when his phone rang. The car salesman.
"Mr. Hall, I apologize for the delay, but I've found it. Are you available to come in this week?"
"Yes, absolutely. When?"
"Wednesday afternoon works for me. Say, five thirty?"
"Yes. Thank you."
He hung up and immediately went to Ian's office. 
"The salesman found a car. I'm meeting him Wednesday at five thirty."
"Good. I'll drive you."
 "You don't have to—"
"The reports are done. Workload is low. I don't need to stay late. Might as well confirm my recommended salesman did his job properly."
"Alright. Thank you."
Ian nodded, and Jay returned to his desk.
Wednesday at five, they left the office together. Ian drove them across the city to the dealership. The salesman met them at the entrance, shaking hands with Ian first and then Jay.
"Mr. Hagen, always a pleasure. And Mr. Hall, I think you'll be very pleased with what I found."
He led them to the lot. The car was unassuming, a dark blue sedan from a brand known for reliability and safety. Newer than Jay had hoped for and not too heavily used.
The salesman handed Jay a folder. "Full inspection paperwork. Service history. Everything's in order."
Jay opened the folder and stared at the pages. Technical specifications. Maintenance records. Numbers and terms he barely understood.
"I don't know much about cars," Jay admitted.
Ian took the folder from him and flipped through it. The salesman stood by, waiting. After a moment, Ian handed the folder back to Jay.
"Everything looks in order. It's a solid choice."
"You're sure?"
"The service history is clean and the price is fair. I'd recommend it."
Jay looked at the car again. It wasn't flashy or exciting, but it was reliable and safe.
"Alright. I'll take it."
The salesman smiled. "Excellent. Let's handle the paperwork."
They went inside, and Jay signed what felt like an endless stack of documents. Ian stood beside him, occasionally pointing out a clause or asking the salesman a clarifying question.
The salesman handed him the keys. "Congratulations, Mr. Hall. Drive safe."
They walked back out to the lot. Jay stood beside the car, keys in hand, feeling oddly uncertain.
"Thank you for coming with me," Jay said.
"It wasn't a problem. Drive safely. I'll see you tomorrow."
He walked to his own car, and Jay watched him go, disappointed. The whole thing had taken less than an hour. He'd wanted more time.
Jay got into the car and adjusted the seat, the mirrors, familiarizing himself with the controls. Then he started the engine and drove home. That evening, he called his mother.
"Jay! Did you find something?"
"Yes, I picked it up today. It's a good car. Tim will like it."
"Oh, thank goodness. I was starting to worry. You kept saying everything was fine, but—"
"Everything is fine. It just took longer than expected."
His mother sighed, relief evident in her voice. "You're a good brother, Jay. Tim's going to be so happy."
"I hope so."
She'd called several times over the past weeks, asking about progress. Jay had lied confidently each time, saying everything was proceeding smoothly, hoping the salesman wouldn't disappoint him. They talked for a few more minutes, confirming details for the weekend. Jay promised to arrive Friday evening. 
Jay packed Thursday evening, planning to leave straight from work to beat the traffic. He left at four on Friday, wanting to get a head start. Four hours to his hometown, longer if the Friday traffic was bad.
He stopped by Ian's office before leaving. 
"Heading out?"
"Yes. I'll see you Monday."
"Drive safely. And enjoy the weekend."
"Thank you."
They looked at each other for a long moment. Jay wanted to say something, but he didn't know what. A third Friday dinner lost.
"I'll see you Monday," Jay said again.
"Yes. Monday."
Jay left the office and walked to the parking garage. The custom they'd built felt fragile suddenly, like it was dissolving.
He got into the car and started the engine, pulling out into the Friday evening traffic. The drive ahead was long, but at least he had the car for Tim. He told himself things would get back to normal in November. After the hot springs trip. After the vacation. He just had to wait.
The drive out of the city was slow, traffic exactly as bad as he'd predicted. Jay gripped the steering wheel and tried to focus on the road, on anything except the persistent ache that had taken up residence in his chest. Four hours stretched ahead of him. Four hours to think about everything he was trying not to think about.
He'd never felt like this before. This hollow, aching wrongness. Like something essential was missing, even though objectively everything was fine. He saw Ian every day. They talked, they worked together, they had plans stretching months into the future. So why did it feel like he was starving?
The runs were postponed. The dinners no longer happened. Their morning briefings were short. The evenings planning trips in the office lounge had stopped once the reporting season ended. These little pieces that had given shape to his weeks were gone, and nothing had replaced them. Jay was miserable and didn't know how to cope with this.
He turned on the radio and drove.
Scene 5
Pining
Friday evening, Ian sat alone in his apartment with a glass of Jay's red-currant tincture.
He'd poured just a small amount, savouring the sweet warmth. It tasted like comfort. Like Jay's devotion poured into a tangible liquid. Ian set the glass down and told himself to behave.
This was ridiculous. He was a grown man, forty years old, sitting alone and pining like a teenager. Jay was gone for a weekend. Two days. That was nothing. Ian had spent years alone. He could certainly manage forty-eight hours.
Except it wasn't nothing. They saw each other constantly at work and somehow not at all.
It wasn't any easier for him than it was for Jay, though Jay probably didn't realize that. The missed Friday dinners felt like a loss, something slipping through his fingers that he didn't know how to hold onto. But he had things to look forward to. The hot-springs trip. The vacation in November.
Ian couldn't believe they actually had vacation plans. He couldn't remember the last time he'd taken a real vacation. A decade, maybe more. He'd never thought much about it before. Work had always been enough. But now—now the perspective of that trip was what held him together. Knowing that in a few weeks, he'd have Jay's undivided attention again.
Jay arrived late Friday night, parking the car at the neighbour's house and sneaking into his mother's home like a conspirator. He'd barely closed the door when footsteps thundered down the stairs.
"Jay!"
Ema reached him first, throwing her arms around him. Ari appeared next, and even Tim came down, trying to look casual but clearly excited.
"You made it," Tim said.
"Of course I made it. It's your birthday."
His mother appeared in the hallway. "Come in, come in. Are you hungry? I saved dinner."
"I'm fine. I ate on the way."
"Tea, then. Sit down, tell us about the drive."
Jay let himself be pulled into the warmth of the house, surrounded by voices and the comfort of family.
Saturday afternoon, Tim's birthday party took place in a small local venue with worn floors, a place that hosted birthday parties, anniversary dinners, and graduation celebrations for families that couldn't afford anything fancier. It was cramped, decorated with streamers and balloons, tables crowded together.
Family and friends filled the space with noise. Uncles Jay rarely saw, cousins he didn't recognize, Tim's closest classmates. Ari played with younger children in the corner. Ema had brought Lam, the two of them inseparable these days. Instead of the glamorous Victorian gowns from Ian's gala, they wore simple dresses. They still talked about the ball though, Jay overheard them reminiscing about the orchestra and the fireworks.
The food was adequate. Typical small-town venue dishes, heavy on volume to compensate for any lack of sophistication. Casseroles and roasted vegetables and platters of meat. The cake was big enough to feed everyone twice over, decorated with blue frosting. Music played from a loudspeaker in the corner, slightly too loud and slightly distorted.
Jay found a seat near the back and watched the room. His stepfather's side of the family was here in force, cousins and aunts and uncles who had never been particularly warm toward him. His mother's side was smaller, mostly older relatives who remembered him as a child.
He'd always found these gatherings awkward. The sense of being an outsider in his own family, tolerated but not quite belonging. But today, he discovered he didn't care as much anymore. He had his own life now. This was just one part of it, not the whole.
This was the opposite of Ian's gala. Shabby around the edges, messy, imperfect, nothing elegant about it. But it was full of love.
Jay was reminded that he came from humble beginnings. This was his world—simple, warm, unpretentious. He didn't need to perform here or worry about wearing the right clothes.
When the time came for the big reveal, Jay's mother called for everyone's attention. Tim stood in the centre of the room, looking confused.
"What's going on?"
Jay pulled the car keys from his pocket. "Happy birthday."
"What?"
"Come outside."
The whole party followed them out to the parking lot, where the blue sedan was waiting. Tim stopped dead, his mouth falling open.
"Is that—"
"It's yours. Happy eighteenth."
Tim made a sound that was half-laugh, half-shout, and threw his arms around Jay. "Are you serious? This is mine?"
"Yes."
"Oh my god. Oh my god." Tim pulled back and ran to the car, circling it like he couldn't believe it was real. "This is insane. Jay, this is—I can't—"
Tim got into the driver's seat and immediately started adjusting everything, his hands shaking with excitement. Jay's stepfather came over and clapped Jay on the shoulder, the first real acknowledgement he'd given him all day.
"It's a good thing you did."
Jay nodded and watched. His mother was crying. Ema was filming the whole thing on her phone.
Later, when people were starting to leave, Jay found Ema sitting outside on the venue's small patio. Jay sat down beside her. "I wanted to ask you something."
"Sure."
"The botanical garden tickets. For Ian's birthday. Why did you choose that?"
"Leo helped me pick it. He said Ian would definitely love a change of scenery."
Of course. Of course it was Leo's scheme. Everything always was. But he wasn't really mad anymore. If anything, he was pleased. They had something to look forward to in spring. A whole weekend away from the city, just the two of them.
"Did he tell you anything else?"
"Just that Ian never goes anywhere fun, and you'd probably enjoy showing him around your old city. Was it okay? I wasn't sure if it was too personal."
"No, it was a good choice. He's excited about it."
"Good. I'm glad."
"Thanks, Ema," Jay said.
She bumped her shoulder against his. "Anytime."
Sunday afternoon, Jay took the train back to the city. He hadn't traveled by train in years, not since he'd started working with Ian. Before that, trains had been his primary method of getting anywhere. The process felt nostalgic if slightly uncomfortable, requiring him to change trains twice, first in the nearby city, then in a bigger hub along the way. Each transfer meant waiting on platforms, watching the crowds, hauling his bag from one train to another. It was tedious, much longer than driving would have been, but he'd left the car with Tim.
He sat by the window and watched small towns give way to suburbs, then to the outskirts of the city. By the time he reached his stop, evening was falling. He took a taxi to his building, and when he reached his apartment, he pulled out his phone and sent a text to Ian. "Everything went great. Home safe."
Ian's reply came within minutes: "I'm glad. Get some rest. See you tomorrow."
Ian read Jay's text and set his phone down on the coffee table. Home safe. Good. He opened the wooden box again and poured another small measure of the red currant tincture. Just a small amount, like medicine. Medicine for pining.
