Chapter 41: New traditions
Scene 1
Companions
Thursday morning felt different before Jay even opened his eyes. The light streaming through his bedroom window seemed brighter. Two years. Today marked exactly two years since he'd walked into Turner & Associates, hopeful, terrified, and desperate.
He got up and showered. The mirror showed someone he almost didn't recognise—still pale, still soft-featured, but no longer hunched with anxiety. The apartment around him was proof of how far he'd come. His home.
As he buttoned his shirt, his hands slowed. The memory surfaced without permission: Ian's arms around him yesterday, holding him together when everything felt like it was falling apart. The warmth of that embrace had taken root somewhere deep inside him, out of his reach.
Jay grabbed his bag and left before he could think about it anymore.
The office was empty when he arrived, the overhead lights still dim in standby mode. Jay stood in the reception area for a moment, letting the cool air wash over him. The layout stretched before him—neatly arranged desks, the glass walls of Ian's office, the kitchen area where they'd shared countless coffees.
With Gal gone, the space felt breathable again. No more watching his back, no more calculating safe routes through the floor.
He moved to his workstation and set down his bag. Everything was exactly as he needed it. Ian had made sure he was comfortable from the beginning, even when he'd been cold and suspicious. Even then, the care had been there.
Jay pulled up his calendar and started reviewing the day's schedule. Meetings, reports, a conference call in the afternoon. Normal and manageable.
The distant chime of the elevator broke the silence. Jay looked up. Morning light poured through the panoramic windows, rendering everything in sharp summer light: the empty desks, the geometric shadows, Ian walking toward him through bands of brightness and shade. 
For a moment Jay saw him as a stranger might—the composure, the expensive clothes, the way he walked like someone accustomed to being watched. Then their eyes met, and Ian became simply Ian again.
"Good morning," Ian said. He paused briefly and touched the edge of Jay's desk before he continued toward his office.
"Morning," Jay replied.
The word felt ordinary. Jay turned back to his screen and felt his anxiety loosen slightly. With Ian here, the difficulties of recent days seemed more bearable.
The gossip about Gal's firing had already faded. A week was apparently long enough for the story to lose its freshness. New hires acting out wasn't unheard of, and security's swift response had closed the matter cleanly. For most people, it was just another incident in the office's history, barely worth mentioning.
Jay found comfort in that. The world kept turning. He wasn't a spectacle.
He worked through his tasks determined to project normalcy. Ian was already shaken enough. The last thing Jay wanted was to add to that burden, to make Ian feel like he had to keep protecting him. Gal's behaviour had dampened the entire office atmosphere for weeks—Jay refused to become another source of tension.
His calendar reminder chimed. Morning briefing.
Jay gathered his tablet and notes, then crossed to Ian's office. Through the glass wall, he could see Ian at his desk. Even after two years, the sight still was unreal. This brilliant man had become the center of Jay's entire world.
Jay knocked lightly on the doorframe.
Ian looked up. "Come in. How are you feeling today?"
"I'm good. Ready to tackle the day."
"You slept well?"
"Well enough. What's on the agenda for today?"
"Standard tasks. Let's go through the schedule."
They moved through the briefing. Jay reported on the progress of various projects, flagged potential issues, confirmed meeting times. Ian listened with complete attention, interjecting questions. On the surface, everything appeared normal.
But Jay could see the tension in Ian's shoulders that shouldn't have been there. Ian was worried about him, Jay realized. Still worried, despite Jay's best efforts to appear fine.
And because Jay was watching so closely, he could also see Ian making the same effort in reverse—trying to project calm, trying to be the pillar Jay could lean on. They were both performing, and they both knew it.
"Jay. If you need time—"
"I don't. I mean, thank you, but I'm okay. Really."
"This kind of situation takes time to process. There's no shame in that."
"I know. And I appreciate you saying it. But honestly, being here, working—it helps. It reminds me that things are normal again."
"All right. But the offer stands. Any time you need it."
"I know," Jay said again, and meant it with everything he had.
For a moment they just sat there, looking at each other across the desk. This, Jay thought. These moments of connection, of mutual understanding and care—they were worth the pain, worth every difficult moment that had led here.
"We should get started on the projections. The board will want preliminary numbers by next week," Ian said finally.
"I'll pull the data this afternoon. Anything else you need right now?"
"No, that's everything. Thank you, Jay."
Jay headed for the door, then paused with his hand on the frame. He looked back. Ian was already refocusing on his screen, but his posture had relaxed slightly, the tension in his shoulders less pronounced.
They were both trying, and both seeing through each other's efforts. 
Around three, Luc appeared at his desk. "Break time."
"What's up?"
Luc pulled over a spare chair and sat down. "Just wanted to check in. See how you're doing."
Luc had always been good at that—caring without making it uncomfortable. 
"I'm okay. Better than last week, definitely."
"Yeah?"
"Yeah. It still bothers me, honestly. The whole situation. But it's getting easier. Each day feels a bit lighter."
"For what it's worth, you handled everything really well. Better than most people would have."
"I don't know about that."
"I do. And I'm glad you're feeling better. But seriously, if you need anything—"
"I know. Thank you for checking."
Luc nodded and headed back to his own desk. People cared. That still felt strange to accept, but it was getting easier.
Most of the office cleared out by six. Jay kept working, Ian's office light still glowing behind its glass walls. At seven-thirty, Jay finished compiling the preliminary data Ian had requested. He saved everything then gathered his tablet and headed to Ian's office.
Ian looked up as Jay knocked. "Come in. Is that the projection data?"
"Initial numbers. I'll need to verify a few sources tomorrow, but this should give you a working framework."
"Thank you. We should head out. It's getting late."
They gathered their things and headed for the exit. The building was mostly empty at this hour, their footsteps echoing in the lobby. The elevator arrived and they stepped inside. Jay pressed the button, then leaned against the wall, suddenly aware of how tired he was. 
"Jay. Would you like to have dinner? If you don't have other plans."
The question surprised Jay. Not because it was strange—they'd had dinner together many times, but those had always been business dinners, client meetings, work functions. This felt different. There was slight uncertainty in Ian's voice when he asked.
"I don't have plans. Dinner sounds good."
"There's a cosy pasta place not far from here. Does that work?"
"Yeah."
The restaurant was understated but clearly upscale. The host recognized Ian and led them to a table. They ordered—pasta for Jay, fish for Ian, wine that Ian selected after a brief consultation with their server.
"I wanted to say something," Ian began once their wine arrived. He turned the glass slowly between his fingers. "It's been two years since you became my assistant. I wanted to thank you for continuing to work with me despite how difficult things have been."
"Ian—"
"Let me finish. When you first arrived, I made things harder than they needed to be, and you had every reason to leave. But you stayed. You worked hard and you built a place here. And then, just when things should have been easier, you had to deal with harassment again."
"That wasn't your fault."
"No. But it happened on my watch, to someone under my protection. To someone I—" Ian stopped, seeming to reconsider his words. "To someone I care about very much. I know it had to be difficult enduring that situation."
"It does still bother me. More than I want it to. But not for the reasons you might think."
"What do you mean?"
"The harassment itself was awful, obviously. But what really gets to me is how badly I misjudged her. I thought Gal was harmless. I completely misread the situation until it was almost too late. That's what keeps circling in my head—how wrong I was."
"You weren't wrong to give her the benefit of the doubt initially. That's not a failure of judgment. It's human decency."
"Maybe. But I should have seen it sooner."
"Predatory behavior is designed to be difficult to identify until it escalates. The fault lies entirely with Gal, not with your perception. You responded appropriately once the situation became clear."
"I'm glad it was resolved so quickly. That security took it seriously, that the company acted immediately. I know that doesn't always happen."
"It should always happen. And I wish it hadn't needed to happen at all. I wish I'd seen the warning signs earlier, been more proactive in protecting you."
"You can't prevent every bad thing."
"No. But I can try."
"Thank you for listening. For letting me complain about it."
"Any time you need to."
Their food arrived, breaking the moment. The conversation moved to more mundane topics.
By the time they finished dinner, Jay felt lighter. The tightness that had lived in his shoulders for the past week had finally eased. Speaking honestly about his feelings, having Ian listen without judgment—it had helped more than Jay had realized it would.
Ian paid the bill despite Jay's protest, and they walked back to the car through the warm evening air.
"Thank you for dinner," Jay said as they drove back toward their neighborhood. "I needed that."
"So did I. It felt good, just having dinner together. As companions, not as boss and assistant."
When Ian pulled up outside Jay's building, Jay was reluctant to leave the cocoon of the car, this small space where everything felt simpler.
"Good night, Ian."
"Good night, Jay. I'll see you tomorrow."
Jay got out and watched Ian drive the short distance to his own building. Then he headed inside and entered his apartment.
The evening replayed in his mind. Ian's words, the warmth in his eyes, the way he'd said "companions" like it meant something. The way the entire evening had felt like something more than what they were to each other.
Jay pressed his hand against his chest, feeling his heart beat beneath his palm.
He'd survived two years, built a life, found a place. And somewhere along the way, he'd fallen completely in love with the person who'd made it all possible.
Scene 2
Obvious favouritism
The gym was moderately busy on Saturday morning, the weekend regulars scattered across equipment. Jay spotted Rus immediately, demonstrating something to another client with animated gestures.
Rus caught sight of Jay and waved him over. "Give me two minutes," he called.
Jay set down his bag and started stretching, working through the warm-up that had become second nature over the past year. Rus appeared beside him. 
"All right, ready? How are you feeling today?"
"A little soreness in my shoulders, but nothing bad."
"Good. We'll focus on legs. So how was your week? You look tired."
"Long week."
"Work stuff?"
"Yeah."
They worked through the first set, Rus watching Jay's form, calling out corrections when needed. But once they moved to the next exercise, Rus circled back to the topic.
"Long week good or long week bad?"
Jay hesitated. He'd gotten better at opening up, but some things still felt too personal to discuss. Except Rus was looking at him with concern, and the gym was safe territory, and maybe talking about it one more time would help.
"Bad. But it's getting better now."
"What happened?"
So Jay told him. Not everything, but the essential facts. A coworker who'd become inappropriately fixated. Escalating behaviour. A false accusation that security had quickly disproven. The coworker's immediate termination.
Rus stopped entirely. "Wait. Hold on. Someone harassed you at work?"
"Yes."
"And then accused you of something you didn't do?"
"Yes."
"What the—" Rus's expression cycled through shock and fury in rapid succession. "Jay, that's insane. Are you okay? Is this person gone? Did they face actual consequences?"
"She was fired immediately. Security reviewed everything, saw it was false, and she was escorted out that day. It was handled properly."
"And you didn't say anything? You've been dealing with this alone?"
"Not alone. My boss and the company took it seriously. I had support."
"That's awful, Jay. I can't believe someone would do that to you. You're like the least threatening person I know."
"I misjudged her completely. I thought she was just annoying. I didn't see how bad it was getting until it was almost too late."
"This is heavy, man. You shouldn't just sit with it. We should drink it off. Tonight. My place. I'll order food, we'll get properly drunk, and you can tell me exactly what you want to say to this Gal woman and I'll agree with every word."
It was tempting. The idea of getting drunk and venting everything to someone who wouldn't judge or worry or try to fix things sounded good.
"I have an appointment this afternoon."
"Cancel it."
"I can't. It's the tailor appointment Leo arranged as a birthday gift. It's already been scheduled for weeks."
"A tailor appointment is more important than your mental health?"
"It's about obligation. Leo went through trouble to arrange it. I can't just not show up."
"Leo would understand."
"Maybe. But I'd still feel terrible about it. I appreciate the offer, really. But I've had support. Good support. Ian's been there. Luc checked on me. I'm doing better than I was."
"Fine. But if you change your mind, if you need anything—drinks, distraction, someone to yell at this woman's general direction—you call me. Any time."
"I will."
They finished the workout with Rus being noticeably gentler, his concern manifesting as attention to Jay's form and frequent check-ins about how he was feeling. By the time Jay headed home, he felt better. Lighter, the same way he'd felt after dinner with Ian. Talking helped. Having people care helped. He was still learning that lesson.
The tailor's shop was located in a neighbourhood where the buildings were old and elegant, and the prices were displayed only upon request. Jay had been here three times before, and each visit had left him feeling small and inadequate. He stood outside for a moment, gathering himself, then pushed open the door.
The interior was hushed and immaculate. A staff member appeared immediately. The same man as before, tall and thin with silver hair and an expression as if he’d he smelled something unpleasant.
"Mr. Hall?"
"Yes."
"Welcome. Mr. Turner arranged everything. Please, follow me."
Jay followed him to the back, where the actual fitting room waited. The same setup as before—raised platform, three-way mirrors that showed every angle, harsh lighting that somehow managed to be both cold and revealing. The head tailor stood waiting with his assistant, both looking offended.
"We have your measurements on file. We'll need to confirm them and discuss details."
The tailor circled him slowly, measuring tape in hand. He made disapproving sounds as he worked, noting measurements on a tablet.
"Arms up, please."
Jay raised his arms. The tape measure encircled his chest, then his waist. Jay kept his eyes on the middle distance, avoiding the mirrors. He turned when instructed, answered questions about comfort and fit. The assistant made notes. Neither of them engaged in small talk.
It was humiliating in small ways. The way the assistant handled the clothes as if they were too good for the person wearing them. The constant reminders that this world of bespoke tailoring and expensive fabric existed for people born into it, not for people like Jay who were just visiting.
But Jay endured it. He stood straight, answered politely, didn't let the discomfort show on his face. A year ago, this would have sent him spiraling into questions about his worth, his place, whether he deserved any of the good things in his life.
Now? It was just unpleasant. A rude tailor was just a rude tailor. Their condescension said more about them than it did about him.
"We'll have the suits ready in three weeks. We'll contact you to schedule a final fitting."
"Thank you."
Jay left the shop and walked back into the afternoon heat. He found a bench in the shade and sat for a moment, letting the tension drain from his shoulders. The experience would never be pleasant, and he'd made peace with that.
Jay spent the rest of the afternoon cleaning his apartment. He was halfway through when someone knocked on his door. He opened it to find Leo standing in the hallway, holding a bottle of champagne.
"We have very important matters to discuss and I brought champagne because champagne makes everything better," Leo announced, walking past Jay without waiting for an invitation.
"What's going on?"
Leo set the champagne on the kitchen counter, m pulling glasses from the kitchen cabinet as though he'd been there a hundred times before. "Ian's fortieth birthday in September. We're going to throw him the most magnificent party this city has ever seen."
"Ian doesn't like surprises. He definitely doesn't like elaborate parties. This is a terrible idea. He will be deeply uncomfortable while surrounded by people he doesn't particularly want to see."
"Ian needs this. He needs to be celebrated. He needs to be reminded that people care about him, that he's valued. When was the last time someone threw him a proper party?"
"There's probably a reason for that."
"The reason is that everyone's too afraid to try. Everyone tiptoes around him like he's made of glass. But he's not. He's just... He's lonely. And he doesn't even realize it. A party would be good for him."
"Even if that's true, I don't think I should be involved in planning it."
"Why not?"
"Because it feels invasive. It feels like I'm going behind his back. Ian trusts me. I don't want to betray that trust by plotting surprise parties he explicitly wouldn't want."
"Jay, I've known Ian for decades. I've seen him at his worst. I've seen him isolated and bitter and convinced he has to face everything alone. He's gotten better since you arrived, but he's still that person underneath, convinced he doesn't deserve good things. Waiting for everything to fall apart."
Jay knew what Leo meant. He'd seen glimpses of that—the way Ian sometimes seemed surprised by kindness.
"A party won't fix that," Jay said.
"No. But it might remind him that people want to celebrate him anyway. That he matters to more than just the bottom line of Turner & Associates. Look, I'm not asking you to plan the whole thing. I'm asking you to help me gauge whether he'd actually want this. To test the waters. You're closer to him than anyone. If you tell me it would make him miserable, I'll reconsider."
Jay drank some of his champagne. It was excellent, crisp and dry. He thought about Ian spending his birthday alone, probably working, maybe having a polite dinner with Leo because tradition demanded it. About Ian believing that was all he deserved.
"I don't like this," Jay said finally.
"Noted."
"I'm not promising anything. I'll ask some questions, see how he feels about it. But if I get even the slightest indication that he'd hate a party, you're dropping it."
"Deal. I knew I could count on you. You're the only one Ian actually listens to."
"That's not true."
"It absolutely is. Ian values your opinion more than anyone else's. If you tell him a celebration is a good idea, he'll actually consider it. If I tell him, he'll just roll his eyes and ignore me."
Jay felt heat rise in his face. "You're exaggerating."
"I'm really not. But we can debate Ian's obvious favouritism another time. Thank you. For caring enough about Ian to go along with this. I know he matters to you."
They finished the champagne with Leo outlining elaborate party plans that Jay mostly ignored. By the time Leo finally left it was nearly ten o'clock and Jay was exhausted. He sank onto the couch, processing the conversation. Leo had noticed how much Ian mattered to Jay.
That shouldn't have been surprising. Jay had never been subtle about his feelings, at least in terms of how much he cared about Ian's well-being. He just hadn't realized it was quite so obvious to outside observers.
But setting that aside—did he want to help plan this celebration? The manipulative aspect still bothered him. Ian deserved to have choices about his own life, including how he spent his birthday.
On the other hand, Leo was right about one thing. Ian never expected recognition or celebration. He gave so much to everyone around him and accepted so little in return.
Jay thought about Ian's expression at dinner on Thursday. The way he'd thanked Jay for staying, for trusting him, for being part of his life. The warmth in his eyes when he'd called them companions. Ian deserved to see that people cared about him, that he mattered. Even if he'd never ask for that confirmation himself.
Scene 3
Vanilla and spices
The office was empty by seven on Monday evening. Jay sat at his desk with a cooling cup of coffee, watching Ian review projections on his laptop. He had been trying to find an opening for the past twenty minutes.
Finally, he gathered his tablet and walked to Ian's office, knocking lightly on the door frame. "Do you have a minute?"
Ian looked up. "Of course. Come in."
Jay entered, closed the door behind him and sat in one of the chairs across from Ian's desk.
"I wanted to discuss something. It's not work-related."
"Alright."
"It's about your birthday."
"What about it?"
"Leo wants to throw you a party. A real celebration, with people from the office and maybe others you know."
"Of course he does. Let me guess—he's already started planning."
"He might have some ideas. But he wanted me to ask how you felt about it first. If you're opposed to the whole thing, I can tell him to back off."
"Can you? I've known Leo for years. Backing off isn't in his vocabulary."
"I'll make him. I'll—" Jay paused, recognizing the impossibility of that promise. "I'll try very hard."
"Leo asked you to convince me."
"He asked me to test the waters. To see how you felt about it. I told him if you didn't want it, I'd make sure he backed off. And I meant that. I'll pacify Leo or die trying if you'd rather skip the whole thing. But I think it might be good for you. To be celebrated, I mean. To have people gather because they want to acknowledge that you matter to them. I enjoyed my own party. It felt nice to have friends and family there, to see that people cared enough to show up. But if you don't want that, if the idea makes you uncomfortable, then I completely understand. I'll tell Leo to drop it, and I'll keep telling him until he actually listens."
"You're very concerned about my well-being."
"Of course I am. You've done a lot for me. The least I can do is make sure you're not forced into something you'd hate."
"I don't particularly enjoy parties. Especially ones centred around me. They feel performative. Obligatory."
"I understand. I'll tell Leo—"
"But I appreciate the thought behind it. And if you think it might be worthwhile, I'm willing to consider it."
"You are?"
"Tell Leo he can do whatever he wants. Within reason. I'm not wearing a party hat, and there better not be any speeches."
"That's fair. Thank you. I think it will be good. I'll make sure it's good."
"I believe you. Now, should we actually finish this projection, or are we both too distracted?"
They worked for another hour. Ian watched Jay from his office, the smile Jay couldn't quite hide. Jay cared about him. He worried about his comfort and wanted him to be happy. That tenderness was almost unbearable in its sweetness. Ian would endure any party, no matter how uncomfortable, if it meant seeing Jay look that pleased and hopeful.
When they finally packed up, Ian drove Jay home. It was becoming commonplace now, these late evenings followed by car rides.
"Thank you," Jay said when they pulled up to his building.
"For what?"
"For saying yes. To the party."
"You're welcome."
Jay entered his apartment and pulled out his phone to text Leo: "He agreed. Plan your party. But keep it reasonable."
The response came within seconds: "I KNEW IT. You're a miracle worker."
Jay sat on his couch and stared at the ceiling. His mind was already racing ahead to the next problem: what to get Ian for his birthday.
Something thoughtful. Something that would show how much Jay cared without making things uncomfortable. The problem was that Ian had everything. Anything Jay could afford to buy, Ian could buy himself ten times over without thinking about the cost.
Jay cycled through possibilities. Books? Art? He didn't know enough about Ian's tastes to choose well. Electronics? Same problem—Ian's standards were too high and his means too extensive.
An experience, maybe? Tickets to something? But what did Ian actually enjoy that he wasn't already doing?
Jay pulled out his laptop and started researching, looking for inspiration. Concert tickets, museum exhibitions, sporting events—all of it felt too impersonal.
Hours passed. Jay's search history became increasingly desperate. "Gifts for people who have everything." "Thoughtful birthday presents." "Meaningful gifts for men."
Nothing felt right.
He was about to give up for the night when a memory surfaced. Years ago, back in his small town, his grandfather had made tinctures and liqueurs. Jay remembered the big glass jars lined up on shelves, the measuring of spices and fruits, the sweet smell of alcohol and sugar. His grandfather would bottle them at Christmas, giving them away to neighbours and friends with handwritten labels.
Ian liked good alcohol. That much Jay knew. He had refined tastes, appreciated quality. The idea took shape slowly. Homemade infusions—different flavours, bottled and labeled. It wasn't expensive in terms of money, but it required time and care. Was it too simple? Too plebeian for someone like Ian?
Jay stared at his laptop screen, uncertain. He didn't have much time—the party was in just over a month. If he was going to do this, he needed to start soon.
But what if Ian found it cheap? What if homemade gifts came across as childish or inappropriate?
Jay chewed his lip, then made a decision. He'd start the project. Order the supplies, begin the infusions, see how they turned out. In the meantime, he'd keep thinking about alternatives. If he came up with something better, he could always abandon this plan.
He opened several online shops in new tabs and started adding items to carts. Large glass jars for steeping. Smaller bottles for the final product. Funnels, strainers, labels. He'd need base liquors and fruits and spices. Vanilla beans, citrus, berries, herbs.
By the time he finished ordering, his kitchen was going to look like a small distillery.
Jay completed the purchases and closed his laptop, still uncertain but committed. At worst, he'd have wasted some money and time. At best, he'd give Ian something no one else would think to make. Something that said, without words, how much Ian mattered to him.
The next morning, Jay arrived at the office to find Ian already at his desk. They had a meeting scheduled at ten to review the remaining candidates for Gal's replacement. Jay brought his notes and sat down in Ian's office.
"I have three candidates marked as strong possibilities. The first candidate has excellent technical skills but limited experience with financial analysis. The second has the experience but seems overqualified for the position. The third—"
"Tia Larson," Ian said, tapping one of the files. "She was your third choice?"
"Yes. Ex-military, moved here last year, strong administrative background. She interviewed well—very direct, no nonsense approach. You had her on your list too."
"If we both thought she was a good match, the odds of being wrong are smaller," Ian said.
Jay read the file again, trying to see any red flags he might have missed. Nothing stood out. She'd been polite in the interview and answered questions directly. No warning signs. No uncomfortable moments. But then, there hadn't been any with Gal either.
"I think she's a good choice, but I'll be more vigilant this time."
"Jay—"
"I'm not blaming myself. I'm just being realistic. If there are problems, I'll catch them earlier."
"If there are problems, we'll handle them together. I'll contact HR today, start the hiring process. If everything goes smoothly, she can start in a few weeks."
They returned to work, but Jay couldn't shake the anxiety that had crept in. Another unknown variable. Another chance for things to go terribly wrong. He pushed the thoughts aside and focused on the tasks at hand. There was nothing to be gained from worrying about problems that hadn't happened yet.
It was the middle of summer, vacation season in full swing. Max and Zoe were both gone, traveling somewhere with good weather and outdoor activities. But Ray and Liv had taken to their roles with impressive competence, handling tasks that would have required overtime in previous years. The vacation period didn't mean brutal hours and mounting stress. The work got done. The office ran smoothly without grinding anyone down.
The breathing room gave Jay time for his secret project.
After work on Tuesday, he stopped at a specialty liquor store across town, loading his cart with several bottles of high-quality spirits. Wednesday took him to a gourmet market where he bought vanilla beans, dried lavender, whole spices. Thursday meant the farmer's market for fresh berries and citrus.
He converted his kitchen into a workspace. Glass jars lined his kitchen counter, each one filled with vodka and precisely measured ingredients. Orange peel and cardamom in one. Raspberries and vanilla in another. Coffee beans in a third. The smells mixed together—sharp alcohol undercut with fruit and spice.
Jay had labeled each jar with its contents and the date, mimicking his grandfather's record-keeping. Now came the hard part: waiting. The infusions needed time to develop, weeks of steeping before they'd be ready to strain and bottle.
Friday evening, Ian appeared at Jay's desk at six.
"Let's call it a week. We've done enough," Ian said.
Jay gathered his things, surprised but pleased. There was something nice about ending the week early, the whole weekend stretching ahead. They got into the car and Ian pulled out into traffic.
"Have you eaten?" Ian asked.
"Not yet. I was going to make something when I got home."
"There's a place near here. Would you want to have dinner?"
Jay's heart did a somersault in his chest. "Yes. I'd like that."
Ian took them to a different restaurant this time, a casual place with outdoor seating and a menu focused on grilled vegetables and fresh bread. They sat at a table under a green awning, protected from the late sun.
The food arrived quickly—roasted vegetables and grilled fish, a basket of warm bread they shared between them. 
"What do you do on summer evenings?" Ian asked.
"I've been working out at home, but it's not the same as the gym. I've been trying to run, but I'm terrible at it. I can barely make it two blocks before I'm winded."
"That's normal when you're starting. It gets easier. We could run together, if you'd like. Tuesday evening after work, maybe. Nothing intense, build up your endurance gradually."
"You'd want to do that?"
"I would. It's better with a partner. Helps with accountability and pacing."
"Then yes. I'd like that. Fair warning—you'll probably have to go very slowly."
"That's fine. I could use some easier runs anyway."
When they finally finished and Ian paid—again ignoring Jay's protests—neither of them seemed eager to end the evening. They walked slowly back to the car, the city alive around them.
"Thank you for dinner," Jay said as they drove toward home. "This is becoming a habit."
"Is that bad?"
"No. Not at all. I like it."
"So do I. It's nice. Just spending time together. No agenda, no business purpose. Just—"
"Companionship," Jay finished.
"Yes. Exactly."
When Ian pulled up outside Jay's building, Jay was reluctant to leave again. The car felt like its own small world, separate from everything else, a space where things could be easier than they were in reality.
"See you Monday."
"Have a good weekend, Jay."
"You too."
Jay got out of the car and watched Ian drive away, the taillights disappearing around the corner. Then he went inside and leaned against the closed door. His kitchen still smelled like vanilla and spices. The bottles sat in the dark cabinet, infusing slowly, becoming something new.
Scene 4
Safe love
Rus greeted Jay with an appraising look before they'd even started warming up.
"You look better. More like yourself."
"I feel better. Things have calmed down at work."
"Good. That's really good. I'm glad. You were pretty rough last week."
"Yeah. But it passed faster than I thought it would."
"That's how it works sometimes. You brace for the worst and then life just keeps going. You ready to actually work today or should I take it easy on you?"
"Don't you dare take it easy."
"That's what I wanted to hear."
They worked through their whole plan—weights, cardio, core exercises. Rus pushed him hard but Jay kept up, feeling the burn in his muscles. His mind was clear. His body was responding.
"Same time next week?" Rus asked as they finished.
"Definitely."
Jay headed home thinking the world had regained its equilibrium. Work was manageable, his friends were supportive, and Ian—
Ian was there. Constant, reliable, increasingly present in Jay's daily life.
On Sunday afternoon, Jay sat on his couch with tea and a book. His mind kept drifting, circling back to the same subject it always returned to lately.
Ian.
He set the book aside and thought about it properly. About what he felt. About what it meant. He loved Ian. That much was undeniable. He wanted to be near him, to talk to him, to make him happy. But what did that love look like? What did it require?
The answer, he realized, was simpler than he'd feared. It required nothing. He didn't need Ian to love him back. He didn't need to change their relationship or push for something more. What they had now—these dinners, these late evenings working together, these small moments of closeness—it was enough.
He could never be with Ian romantically. The professional relationship made it impossible. The power dynamic made it inappropriate. And beyond all that, Ian was refined, cultured, someone who lived in a different world entirely. The idea that Ian might want someone like Jay in that way was absurd.
But realizing this, sitting with it fully, Jay discovered something unexpected. It didn't hurt the way he'd thought it would.
Maybe this was better. This way, he could enjoy what they had without fear, without the pressure of expectations or the terror of rejection. He could appreciate their growing companionship without worrying about what came next.
Being with a man had never interested him. Not before Ian. Jay had dated women before, brief relationships that had felt pleasant but never essential. He'd assumed he was just someone with a low sex drive, someone who didn't prioritize romance. The harassment from his first boss had reinforced that—physical intimacy felt threatening, something to avoid.
And now here he was, in love with a man. Which meant he was at least bisexual, he supposed. The label felt strange but accurate.
Though honestly, Jay realized he didn't want to think too hard about the physical realities. The mechanics of being with a man seemed intimidating, frankly terrifying in their specifics. Better not to dwell on it.
Except he did think about it. Constantly. Unwillingly. 
The two times they'd embraced—comfort and exhaustion, nothing romantic about either moment. But Jay remembered the warmth, the way Ian had held him like he was something precious. What would it be like to be touched by Ian with affection? With desire? The thought made his heart race. It made him feel simultaneously drawn forward and desperate to retreat.
He set down his cup and pressed his hands against his cheeks, willing the thoughts away. This was pointless. Worse than pointless—it was dangerous territory, the kind that led to wanting things he couldn't have. Better to focus on what was real. What they actually shared.
Jay moved to his kitchen, checking his jars of infusions. The liquids had already taken on colour from their ingredients, subtle changes that promised flavour. Something to occupy his hands, his mind.
What he wanted wasn't romance, he told himself firmly. It wasn't possession or exclusivity or any of the complicated entanglements that came with relationships. It was closeness. Warmth. More of what they already had. These new patterns they were building felt miraculous enough. He didn't dare ask for more.
And maybe the impossibility of anything physical was a relief. He could love Ian without having to confront the scary, intimate realities.
Safe love. Unrequited love. Love that didn't demand anything of him except to keep showing up, keep being present, keep caring. Jay could do that. He'd gotten very good at it already.
Monday evening, Jay and Ian sat in the office lounge with coffee, the building empty around them, taking a break from the financial reports that had consumed most of the day.
Jay had been thinking about something all afternoon, a question that had been nagging at him since the whole situation with Gal had finally resolved. Now, in this tranquil moment, it slipped out.
"Can I ask you something that might be embarrassing?"
Ian looked at him with immediate interest. "Of course."
"Was I ever as dramatic as Gal? I mean, when I first started. I remember asking questions about everything, trying to understand how things worked. And there was that time you told me I should focus on my own tasks instead of worrying about the bigger picture, and I got all mopey about it."
Jay cringed at the memory. He'd been so hurt by that rebuke, had taken it as confirmation that he was failing, that Ian saw him as incompetent. Looking back now with the perspective of time, his reaction seemed excessive. Dramatic, even. Like Gal's constant whining.
Ian stared at him for a moment, then laughed. Not a small chuckle but a full laugh that lit up his entire face. Jay was transfixed. He'd heard Ian laugh before, but seldom like this.
"Jay. You were the complete opposite. So self-effacing it took me months to get you to speak freely."
"But I asked all those questions—"
"You asked necessary questions to understand your job. That's completely different from seeking attention or creating drama. And that incident you mentioned, when I told you to focus on your own tasks? I was wrong. I was being defensive and suspicious, treating you like a threat when all you were doing was trying to do good work."
"I sulked."
"You went back to your desk and worked harder. That's not drama, Jay. Everything you did when you first started was designed to minimize your presence. You spoke quietly, sat in the back during meetings, apologized for things that weren't your fault. You tried to take up as little space as possible, to avoid causing any inconvenience. Gal was the opposite—constantly seeking attention, creating situations where she was the centre of focus. You were nothing like that."
"So I wasn't annoying?"
"You were never annoying. You were frightened and trying very hard to be perfect. Which broke my heart once I finally recognized it."
Jay looked at Ian, not sure how to respond.
"I should have been more accommodating from the start. I should have recognized that you needed reassurance. My behaviour made everything harder for you. That was my failure."
"You were protecting yourself. After what happened before, that makes sense."
"Perhaps. But it wasn't fair to you. And for what it's worth, watching you come into your own over these past two years has been one of the more rewarding aspects of working with you. You've exceeded every expectation I could have had."
Jay breathed easier. While Ian's description of his early behaviour wasn't exactly flattering, at least he hadn't been a burden.
And Ian's honest laughter had been beautiful. The kind of moment Jay wanted to collect and keep, evidence that Ian could be happy, that he could let his guard down completely.
"We should get back to those reports," Ian said eventually, though he didn't move.
"Probably," Jay agreed, equally stationary.
But for another few minutes, they just sat there, drinking their coffee, sharing the space. Together without needing to be anywhere else.
Jay thought about tomorrow, the run they'd planned. About the birthday party, the tinctures steeping in his kitchen, all the small ways their lives were intertwining more tightly.  He didn't need more. He just needed this to continue.
Scene 5
Running
Jay stood outside his building at eight on Tuesday, the summer air warm against his skin. The river smell drifted up, that particular blend of water and stone and city that marked August evenings. He was doing final stretches when Ian appeared, jogging down the street, and Jay forgot how to think.
Ian wore fitted athletic wear—dark compression pants and a shirt that showed every line of his athletic build. His hair was slightly disheveled from the jog over, his breathing was even despite the distance he must have covered.
Jay realized he was staring and forced his eyes away.
"Ready?" Ian asked, coming to a stop beside him.
"As I'll ever be," Jay replied.
"We'll take it easy. This is supposed to be enjoyable, not punishment."
"You say that now."
"I mean it. Set the pace you're comfortable with. We're not training for anything."
"This used to be my gym slot, you know. Now you're stealing it."
"Too late to give it back now."
They started at a light pace, heading toward the river path. Ian stayed beside Jay, adjusting his stride to match. The evening sun painted everything gold and amber, and the path was dotted with other runners and cyclists, everyone taking advantage of the pleasant weather.
"Keep your shoulders relaxed. You're tensing up," Ian said after the first few minutes.
Jay tried to adjust. "Like this?"
"Better. Focus on your breathing. In through your nose, out through your mouth."
Jay focused on breathing. On keeping his stride even. On not looking at Ian more than necessary, because every glance was a reminder of exactly how fit Ian was, how his body moved with grace that made Jay feel clumsy by comparison.
"You're doing fine. Don't try to go too fast. Just maintain a comfortable pace."
"This is comfortable?" Jay gasped.
"It will be. Give it a few weeks."
Ian kept up a stream of encouragement as they ran. His voice was warm and patient, the same tone he used when coaching Jay through complicated work tasks. They continued along the river path until the sky turned from gold to purple. Jay's lungs burned and his legs protested, but he kept going, driven by stubborn pride.
"Let's stop here," Ian said finally.
Jay nearly collapsed with relief. They slowed to a walk, then stopped at a bench overlooking the water. Jay sat heavily, his heart pounding. Ian sat beside him, barely winded, looking like he could run another ten kilometres without effort.
"That was terrible," Jay said between breaths.
"That was excellent for a first run together."
"I'm completely inefficient at cardio."
"You're doing fine. Better than fine, actually." Ian reached over and briefly touched Jay's shoulder, a gesture of reassurance that sent electricity through Jay's entire body. "I exercise seven days a week. My conditioning is the result of years of consistent work. You can't compare yourself to that."
"You're barely breathing hard."
"Give yourself credit. You kept the pace the whole time and didn't stop even when it was difficult. That's more than most people manage. And it will get easier. Much faster than you think."
Jay nodded, too winded to respond. They sat in silence while his breathing gradually slowed, watching the river. The sky had turned deep blue overhead, the first stars beginning to appear.
"You should stretch when you get home, especially your calves and hamstrings. Take a warm shower, not hot. Drink plenty of water before bed. Tomorrow you'll be sore, but it won't be as bad if you follow those steps."
"You're turning into my second gym trainer," Jay said, finally able to speak normally.
Ian laughed. "Rus will have to step up his game to keep up with me."
"I'm not telling him you said that. He'll take it as a challenge."
"We could do this again, if you want. Make it a weekly thing."
"Every week?"
"If you're willing. Regular cardio is important."
"I'd like that."
Another tradition, another thread weaving their lives together. Another carved-out space where they existed together outside of work obligations. Jay felt his heart expand in his chest, warm and almost painful. 
They got up and started walking back, their pace leisurely now. The route took them through serene streets, past closed shops and lit windows, until they reached the crossroads where their paths diverged.
"Goodnight, Jay. You did well tonight."
"Goodnight, Ian. Thanks for running with me."
Ian headed toward his building, his form illuminated by streetlights and then swallowed by shadow. Jay stood there for a moment, watching him go, feeling his heart contract. Then he turned and walked home, his legs already starting to stiffen.
Wednesday was calm at work. Summer's hold on the office had deepened—the vacation season in full effect, the workload distributed evenly enough that overtime remained unnecessary. Even with several people still away, Ray and Liv handled their responsibilities well.
Jay observed the office dynamics with fondness. Rin had developed an obvious admiration for Ray that manifested in persistent but good-natured attempts at friendship. Unlike Gal's attention-seeking behaviour, Rin's efforts were unobtrusive, almost charmingly awkward.
"Ray, did you want to grab lunch?"
Ray didn't even look up from his screen. "No."
Rin retreated without visible disappointment. "Okay, cool. Maybe another time."
Luc appeared beside Jay's desk moments later, theatrical sympathy written across his features. "Our boy Rin strikes out again. Should we start a support group?"
"He doesn't seem particularly bothered," Jay observed.
"That's what makes it so entertaining. He's already accepted defeat but keeps trying anyway."
Jay could have sworn he saw Ray's mouth twitch, almost like he was fighting back a smile. Maybe Ray was less immune to the attention than he pretended.
Either way, the dynamic was harmless. Pleasant, even.
Jay left at five that day and spent forty minutes doing exercises in his apartment. His legs were still sore from Tuesday's run, but not as bad as he'd feared. Ian's advice had worked.
On Thursday after work, Jay headed to the pool, swimming laps in the cool water until his shoulders burned and his thoughts quieted. He'd neglected swimming for too long. Getting it back felt like reclaiming something important.
By Friday, the soreness had faded to almost nothing. Jay felt stronger, more comfortable in his body. He wrapped up his tasks by four, but when five o'clock came, he didn't leave. He told himself he was just finishing a few small things, but in truth he was hoping Ian would suggest dinner again.
He wasn't disappointed. At six, Ian emerged from his office and stopped by Jay's desk.
"Are you planning to stay late?" Ian asked.
"Not particularly. Just tidying up."
"Dinner?"
Jay couldn't suppress a smile. "Yes."
They drove to the same restaurant with the outdoor patio, the awnings filtering the evening light. Jay had been thinking about it since last Friday, and now that it was happening he was glowing with happiness.
They talked about work and urban planning. When they left, the evening air was still warm. They walked to Ian's car, and Ian drove Jay home, and Jay thanked him, and they said goodnight with that same moment of hesitation before parting.
Jay went inside feeling full. The warmth of those few hours would sustain him through the weekend, until Monday came and he could see Ian again.
