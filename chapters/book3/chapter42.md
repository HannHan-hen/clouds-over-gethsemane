Chapter 42: Invitations
Scene 1
Excessive is the minimum
Jay took a taxi to the gym on Saturday morning. The metro rides had grown tedious—the waiting, the crowds, the transfers. A taxi cost more, but the expense barely registered anymore. His salary increases had changed that calculation without him quite noticing. He could afford convenience now. He could afford not to exhaust himself before he even arrived.
The ride took twenty minutes instead of fifty, and he arrived ready to work instead of already drained. Rus noticed immediately.
"You look chipper," he said.
"I took a taxi."
"Living fancy now."
"Living efficiently."
They worked through the session with Jay's muscles still protesting from Tuesday's run. Rus pushed him through exercises that targeted different areas, and by the end, Jay felt thoroughly worked.
The taxi ride home was equally effortless. Jay showered, made lunch, and sat on his couch with his phone. He'd been putting off this call for some time.
His mother answered on the third ring. "Jay! I was just thinking about calling you."
"Hi, Mom. How are you?"
"Busy. Ari broke his backpack again, and Ema is convinced she needs a new phone. How are things in the city?"
"Good. Work's busy but manageable."
They talked for a few minutes about surface things. Then Jay took a breath and broached the real reason for his call.
"I wanted to talk about Tim's birthday," he said.
"Oh, yes. It's coming up fast, isn't it? He'll be eighteen. I can't believe it."
"What's he asking for?"
His mother sighed. "A car. He's been talking about it for months. Can you imagine?"
"Actually, that's what I wanted to discuss. What were you planning to spend?"
"I was thinking around five thousand. Enough for something reliable, even if it's older. His father and I have been saving."
"What if we doubled that? I'll match whatever you put in. We could get him something nicer than the shabbiest wreck on the lot."
"Jay, you don't have to do that."
"I want to do this. Tim's turning eighteen. He should have a proper present."
"But five thousand—"
"Is manageable for me. I can afford this. Let me do something nice for my brother. Please."
"Are you sure?"
"I'm sure."
"Then... yes. Thank you. Tim will be over the moon. You've really done well for yourself, haven't you?"
"I've been fortunate."
"You've worked hard. There's a difference."
They talked for a while longer about logistics, car options, when to surprise Tim. By the time Jay hung up, his mood had lifted. It felt good to contribute, to be someone his family could rely on instead of the other way around.
Jay checked his bottles, made notes in his recipe journal, and spent the rest of the afternoon feeling good about life.
Monday brought Max and Zoe back to the office, both tan and spirited. Max regaled anyone who would listen with stories about beaches and ancient ruins, while Zoe showed photos of mountain trails.
Amy and Luc had already left for their own trips, the office still half-staffed but functional. The workload had eased enough that the absences didn't create stress. But Rin seemed lost.
He appeared at Jay's desk more frequently now that Luc was gone. He was competent enough—his work was solid—but he hadn't fully integrated into the office dynamics yet. Ray still responded to him with monosyllables or silence, and Rin seemed to orbit uncertainly between desks.
Jay caught him by the break room Tuseday morning. 
"You all right?" Jay asked.
Rin looked up, startled. "Yeah. Just weird without Luc around."
"He'll be back soon."
"I know. It's stupid. I'm not a kid."
"It's not stupid. Luc is your friend. It makes sense you'd miss having him here."
"Thanks."
"If you need anything, just ask. I'm around."
"Yeah. Okay."
"You're doing well. The adjustment period is difficult, but you're handling it better than most."
Rin's expression relaxed slightly. "Thank you. I was worried I was falling behind."
"You're not. Keep going."
Tuesday evening's run came with cooler temperatures. Jay met Ian outside the building, already warmed up and ready. They started at a light pace. The route was the same, and Jay's body protested just as much as before. His lungs burned, his legs ached, but he kept going.
"I've been thinking about the weekend outing. The one I promised," Ian said after ten minutes.
Jay glanced over, trying not to sound too winded. "What did you decide?"
"There's a classical concert on Saturday evening. Chamber music, mostly. I thought we could make a day of it—lunch, then the concert and dinner. If that interests you."
Jay's first reaction was nerves. Classical music wasn't something he knew anything about, and the thought of sitting in an elegant hall surrounded by people who did made his stomach tighten. But then he thought about spending the day with Ian, and the nerves didn't matter as much.
"That sounds good," Jay said.
"You don't have to agree if it doesn't interest you."
"I want to. I've never been to a concert like that. It'll be new."
"Good. I'll handle the tickets."
A weekend with Ian. A whole Saturday spent together, not just dinner but an entire experience. The intimidation factor was high, but the appeal was higher.
"What should I wear?" Jay asked eventually.
"A suit is standard, but smart casual works as well. Whatever you're comfortable in."
"This is a fancy concert hall, isn't it?"
"It's respectable."
"That's not reassuring."
Ian's mouth quirked. "You'll be fine. I promise I won't let you embarrass yourself."
"That's even less reassuring."
They finished the run and sat on the bench. The river moved slowly past, dark and smooth. Jay caught his breath while Ian looked barely winded.
"You're improving. Last week you were struggling at this point."
"Last week I wanted to die. This week I only want to sleep for twelve hours."
They walked back toward their buildings. When they reached the crossroads and separated, Jay watched Ian's departing form with that same contraction in his chest.  A concert this weekend. A full weekend with Ian. He could manage a concert.
Wednesday afternoon, Jay's phone buzzed with a text from Leo: "Emergency meeting. My place. 6pm. Don't be late."
Jay stared at the message, already resigned to whatever scheme Leo had cooked up now. He texted back: "What's the address?"
The response included a location in one of the city's most expensive districts, because of course it did.
Jay left the office at five-thirty, took a taxi across town, and arrived at a sleek high-rise that screamed wealth. The doorman directed him to the penthouse, which occupied the entire top floor.
Leo opened the door. "Come in, come in."
The penthouse was exactly what Jay had expected—spacious, filled with extravagant furniture and art. He followed Leo, trying not to gawk.
"I've been working on the invitations," Leo announced, leading Jay to a dining table covered in samples. "Take a look."
Jay picked up one of the cards. The paper was thick, the lettering embossed in gold. Formal script announced Ian's fortieth birthday celebration, followed by details about date, time, and venue—a ballroom at one of the city's most exclusive hotels.
"Leo, this is—"
"Perfect? I know."
"I was going to say excessive."
"It's Ian's fortieth. Excessive is the minimum. Look at the detail work on the border. And the paper quality—feel that."
Jay felt it. It was indeed exceptional paper. That was exactly the problem.
"This is going to be an extremely formal event, isn't it?"
"Refined. Sophisticated. Worthy of Ian."
"How many people are we talking about?"
"About a hundred, maybe a few more."
"A hundred people?"
"It's not that many for a proper gala. And Ian knows a lot of people, even if he doesn't socialize much anymore."
"Who are you inviting?"
"Everyone important. The office, obviously. But also friends from Ian's past. People who stood by him during the difficult years. Ian isolated himself after the scandal, but there were people who didn't abandon him. They should be there."
"That's actually thoughtful."
"I'm occasionally capable of thoughtfulness. There might be some past flames. People Ian dated casually over the years. Nothing serious, but they were part of his life. They're still on good terms, mostly."
"Oh."
"Very refined people. Very accomplished. Ian has excellent taste. You'll fit right in, don't worry."
"I wasn't worried."
"You look worried."
"I'm concerned about the formality level."
"Speaking of which—the suit. How was the final fitting?"
"I haven't had it yet. They said three weeks."
"You need to look your absolute best. This is going to be a gathering of Ian's peers. Everyone will be dressed impeccably. You can't show up looking ordinary."
"I am ordinary."
"You work for Turner & Associates. You're Ian's right hand. You're not ordinary. Look, this party is important. Ian needs to see that people value him, that he's surrounded by success and elegance and people who care. You're part of that picture. You need to look the part."
Jay felt oddly insecure. "I'll do my best."
"Your best is good. But let me know if you need anything—accessories, shoes, whatever. I can make recommendations."
"I'll manage."
"Good. The party is in four and a half weeks. Everything is falling into place perfectly."
They discussed more details—catering options, music, whether to have speeches. Jay left the penthouse an hour later, his head spinning with details. A hundred people. Past boyfriends. Elegant crowds where Jay would be judged and found wanting.
But it was for Ian. To show Ian he mattered, that people cared about him. That was worth the discomfort.
Jay took a taxi back to his apartment and spent the evening checking his infusion jars with more aggression than necessary. Four weeks to finish the tinctures, to prepare himself mentally, to figure out how to survive an evening surrounded by people from Ian's real world.
He could do this. For Ian, he could do anything.
Friday evening, Ian took Jay to the same restaurant they'd been returning to for weeks. It had become expected now—finishing work at six, driving to the restaurant, sharing a meal.
They ordered and ate talking about the week's events. Max's dramatic retellings of his trip. Rin's questions. The upcoming deadlines for September.
"Have you thought more about vacation time?" Ian asked as they finished their main courses.
"Not really. There's no particular place I want to go."
"You should take time off regardless. Rest is important."
"I won't take vacation unless you do."
"Jay—"
"Ian. I'm not being martyrish. I'm being practical. Taking vacation alone while you're working would just make me anxious. I'd rather wait until we can both take time off."
"That's not fair to you."
"It's my choice."
"A choice you're making because you disapprove of my work ethic."
"A choice I'm making because I prefer working with you to taking forced rest alone. Can we please table this argument? We've had the same conversation before and it didn't go anywhere."
"Alright. Tabled."
As Ian drove Jay home later, he thought he couldn't bear another week without seeing Jay. The weekends were hard enough now. The idea of a full week away from Jay was unbearable.
But that was monumentally selfish. Ian should encourage Jay to take vacation. He should insist on it. Jay deserved rest, deserved time away from the office and the stress and Ian's constant proximity. Ian just couldn't bring himself to let go. He was prioritizing his own desires over Jay's well-being. He was keeping Jay tethered to the office because he couldn't stand the thought of separation. He should be better than this. He should be strong enough to send Jay away for his own good. But he wasn't. He was weak and selfish and desperately grateful that Jay kept refusing to leave.
Scene 2
Complications
Saturday morning at the gym started normally enough. Jay was finishing his warm-up when Rus appeared with an odd expression.
"So. Got something interesting in the mail yesterday."
"What?"
"An invitation. Very fancy. Heavy paper, embossed lettering. Party for your boss. Didn't know I was moving in those circles now." Rus pulled out his phone and showed Jay a photo of the invitation. It was one of Leo's elegant designs.
"Oh god."
"Mic and Van got one too. We're all very confused. We met your boss exactly once, I wouldn't call that friendship. But maybe we misjudged? Is this some high-society thing where you invite everyone you've ever met?"
Jay felt his horror mounting. "No, this is—I don't know what this is. I need to call Leo."
"The one who hired you?"
"Yes. He's organizing the party. I didn't—he wasn't supposed to—" Jay fumbled for his phone and dialed Leo's number. It went straight to voicemail.
"Damn it."
"Jay, it's fine. We're just surprised. Should we RSVP?"
"I don't know. Let me figure out what's happening."
"You look stressed about this."
"Because I am. This isn't—Leo's doing something I didn't agree to."
"Well, let us know. Mic already started looking up what to wear to a gala."
Jay tried calling Leo three more times during his workout. Voicemail every time.
By afternoon, Jay had forced himself to set aside his anxiety about the invitations. He had a concert to attend. An evening with Ian. He couldn't let Leo's schemes ruin it.
He dressed in his gray tailored three-piece suit, the onyx cufflinks Ian had given him for his birthday. He checked himself in the mirror three times, adjusting the waistcoat, smoothing his hair. He could almost pass for someone who belonged in Ian’s world, but the stiffness in his posture exposed him—always out of place, always the impostor.
Ian arrived at four. He was wearing a dark navy suit, perfectly cut, and he looked effortlessly elegant, something Jay suspected he’d never achieve himself. They headed down to Ian's car, and Jay tried to keep his thoughts off Leo and the invitations.
"You look very sharp," Ian said.
"Thank you. So do you."
They drove to a restaurant in the city centre, a place with no sign outside and no prices printed on the menu. Jay had been to similar places with Ian before, but he still felt the discomfort of it—the knowledge that he was performing a version of himself that didn't quite fit.
The morning's revelation about the invitations hadn't helped. He kept wondering what else Leo had done without consulting him.
"You're quiet," Ian observed after they'd ordered.
"Just taking it in," Jay said, which wasn't entirely a lie.
"If you'd rather go somewhere else—"
"No, this is fine. It's nice."
"You look like you're preparing for battle." 
"Do I?"
"A little. Relax. It's just lunch."
"Fancy lunch."
"Still just lunch."
Jay tried to loosen the tension in his shoulders. Ian was trying to put him at ease, and the least Jay could do was meet him halfway.
After lunch, they drove to the concert hall. Ian found parking nearby, and they walked the last few blocks.
"We're early. I wanted to show you the area. There's a sculpture garden just past the hall that's worth seeing."
They walked through streets lined with elegant old buildings, art galleries, expensive boutiques. The sculpture garden was small but beautiful, filled with modern pieces in stone and metal. Jay followed Ian through it, trying to appreciate what he was seeing, but he felt conspicuously out of place.
The concert hall itself was magnificent. Soaring ceilings, marble floors, chandeliers that cast warm light over everything. People milled about in the lobby, all of them looking comfortable. Jay's suit was good, but he still felt provincial, like someone who'd wandered into the wrong room. Ian must have noticed. He touched Jay's elbow lightly, guiding him toward a quieter corner.
"The acoustics are supposed to be exceptional. The hall was renovated five years ago. They reinforced the structure while preserving the original aesthetic."
"It's beautiful."
"You seem uncomfortable."
"I'm just not used to places like this."
"It's just a building. Just people. You belong here as much as anyone."
Jay wanted to believe that. He tried to relax into Ian's reassurance, but Ian's eyes had that look like he was somewhere else entirely. They found their seats, and the concert began.
The music was lovely, intricate and well performed, and Jay tried to focus on it, but he kept noticing Ian's stillness, the way his attention seemed to drift even when his eyes were on the stage. Jay didn't know what was wrong, but he felt a change.
Dinner afterwards was at another elegant restaurant, this one smaller, more intimate. Ian had reserved a table, and they sat across from each other in the low light. Jay ordered something simple, still feeling full from lunch. Ian did the same, but he barely touched his food.
Jay tried to lift the mood, telling Ian a story about Rin accidentally emailing the entire company instead of just Luc, then another about Max's vacation photos featuring an alarming number of seagulls. He kept his tone light, trying to draw Ian out without being obvious about it. Ian smiled, but he'd grown even quieter, as if he was half in another place.
Jay wondered if he'd been too awkward at lunch, too visibly uncomfortable at the concert. Maybe he'd spoiled the evening without realizing it.
So he tried harder. Questions about the music, about the composers, about anything that might draw Ian back out of wherever he'd retreated to. Ian responded, but it sounded like he didn't want to burden Jay with whatever he was thinking.
They both forced tenderness through the tension, pretending nothing was wrong.
When Ian dropped Jay off, they said goodnight like always. Whatever happened, it felt too tangled to address directly.
Sunday was gray, both outside and in Jay's head.
Jay tried to distract himself with cleaning, with reading, with anything that would stop him from replaying the previous evening and trying to identify the problem. He couldn't pinpoint the moment things had turned sour, but they had. Ian had been fine at lunch, a little distant at the concert, and progressively quieter through dinner. Had he said something wrong? Reminded Ian too starkly of the distance between their worlds? He felt like he failed some test he hadn't known he was taking.
In his own apartment, Ian sat on the couch and brooded.
Sam Connelly had loved classical music. Ian had been so excited to share that part of his life, to bring Sam to concerts, to discuss compositions and interpretations. Sam had seemed equally enthusiastic, engaging fully.
All of it a lie. All of it part of the performance Sam had maintained to gain Ian's trust.
And yesterday, sitting in that concert hall with Jay, the memories had intruded. Sam's voice commenting on the orchestra. Sam's hand on Ian's arm during a particularly moving passage. The complete fabrication of shared interest and mutual understanding.
Ian had tried to push it away, to stay present with Jay, but the ghost had won.
Jay had noticed and tried so hard to fix it, and Ian had felt too guilty to let him, too aware that his own past was poisoning something that should be simple and good.
He hadn't meant to let it intrude. Jay deserved better than to be overshadowed by Ian's past, but Ian hadn't been able to shake it. And now Jay probably thought Ian had regretted the entire outing.
Monday morning began with a phone call from Ema that shattered whatever fragile calm Jay had managed to build.
"Jay! I got an invitation!"
"What?"
"To the party! Ian's birthday party! Leo sent me one! I've been messaging him on social media and I told him I wanted to come and he said yes!"
Jay's blood went cold. "Ema, you can't—"
"I know it's fancy, but I'll be so good, I promise. I'll dress up and I won't embarrass you. Please, Jay, please let me come. It's a real gala. I've never been to anything like that."
"Ema, no. You're sixteen. You can't go to something like this."
"But Leo said—"
"I don't care what Leo said. You're not going."
 "Jay, please. I really want to."
"I said no. I'll talk to Mom."
"Mom already said I can't, but if you say it's okay—"
"It's not okay. I'm sorry, but it's not happening."
There was a long silence, and then Ema started crying.
"I have to go. I'll call you later." Jay hung up and immediately dialed his mother.
"I know," she said before he could speak. "She showed me the invitation. I already told her no."
"Good. Thank you."
"She's very upset."
"I know. But she's a child. She doesn't belong at something like this."
"I agree. I'll talk to her again."
Jay hung up and tried Leo's number. Still voicemail.
Ten minutes later, Ema's first text arrived: "Please, Jay. I'll do anything. I won't ask for anything else ever again." By the time he arrived at the office, Jay was exhausted and stressed. The texts from Ema hadn't stopped.
Ian appeared at his desk mid-morning. "Do you have a moment?"
"Of course."
They went to Ian's office. Ian closed the door and turned to face him.
"Is something wrong?"
"No. Why?"
"You seem distracted."
"I'm fine. Just a family thing. Nothing serious."
Ian looked like he wanted to press, but he didn't. "If you need anything—"
"I know. Thank you."
Jay returned to his desk and tried to appear normal, but the texts kept coming and Leo remained unreachable. He hated worrying Ian, especially when Ian was already dealing with whatever had been bothering him on Saturday, but he couldn't explain the Ema situation without admitting Leo's party planning had gone completely off the rails. And he couldn't do that without potentially stressing Ian about his own birthday.
And Ian kept glancing at him from his office. He was certain now. Saturday had been his fault. He'd spoiled the evening and now Jay was hurt. 
By the end of the day, Ema had sent six more texts, each one sadder and more pleading than the last.
Tuesday's jog was tense. Jay couldn't shake the stress, and it showed in the way he ran—too fast at first, then flagging, his breathing uneven.
Halfway through, Ian said, "I wanted to apologize for Saturday."
"What?"
"I wasn't good company. I'm sorry if I made the evening uncomfortable."
"You didn't. I thought I did. I was worried I'd been too awkward."
"You weren't. I let something distract me and I made you uncomfortable. I'm sorry."
"It's okay. Really. I wasn't upset about that."
"Then what were you upset about?"
Ian looked distressed, and Jay felt guilty. He didn’t want to trouble him with Leo’s messes, yet keeping it secret was clearly causing more damage than telling him outright.
"Leo sent invitations to people I didn't expect. Including my sister. Who now desperately wants to attend a formal gala with rich people and alcohol, and my mother and I both said no, and she's been texting me nonstop about how unfair I'm being."
"Leo invited your sister?"
"And my gym trainer. And his friends. People who barely know you. I've been trying to call him all weekend but his phone's off."
"I'll talk to him."
"No. Don't. This party is supposed to be good for you, not a source of stress. I'll deal with Leo myself. As soon as I can actually reach him."
"Jay, this is my party. I should—"
"You should enjoy it. That's all. Let me handle the rest."
Ian looked unconvinced but didn't argue further.
Scene 3
The most proper man
Leo remained unreachable, and Ema's texts kept coming—sad, disappointed, pleading. She promised to behave, to dress perfectly, to not embarrass him. She just wanted to go to a real gala. Jay's stress mounted. Every text felt like a small knife, guilt and frustration twisting together.
Ian noticed. He didn't push, but his concern was visible, and that made Jay feel worse.
By Friday, Jay was worn down. Ian took him to dinner again, but Jay was quiet, picking at his food.
"You're still upset," Ian said halfway through the meal.
"Leo's still unreachable. Ema's still texting. My mother's still angry. I don't know how to fix this."
"Maybe it's not such a bad idea."
"What?"
"Your sister attending. If she's properly supervised."
"You don't understand. My mother will never allow it."
"Why not?"
"She just won't. She doesn't want Ema around wealthy people."
"It wouldn't be like that. You'd be there. I'd be there. We'd watch over her. It's a birthday party, nothing nefarious."
"You don't know my mother."
"No, but I know you. And I know you wouldn't let anything bad happen to your sister."
Jay wanted to believe it could be that simple. But he knew his mother's reasons for keeping distance from his world. The fear that her children might be exposed to people who might hurt them.
"I'm still not convinced," Jay said.
"Think about it. That's all I'm asking."
For the rest of the evening, Jay's mind was tangled with Ema and Leo and the party that was supposed to be simple but had become increasingly complicated. When Ian dropped him off at their building, Jay felt no closer to a solution.
"I'm losing my mind," Jay announced at the gym on Saturday.
"What happened now?" Rus asked.
"Leo invited Ema, my sixteen-year-old sister. And she's furious I won't let her come. She won't stop texting me. My mother is losing her mind. Leo disappeared off the face of the earth. And apparently you got invited too, which—why? You met Ian once."
"Twice, technically. Once when we helped you move, once at your birthday party. And we RSVP'd to the party. Hope that's alright."
"You did?"
"Yeah. Mic is thrilled about the whole formal dress-up thing. He's already bought a new suit. Van's not really into it but Mic convinced him to come anyway. If you'd rather we didn't—"
Jay groaned and put his head in his hands. "I don't mind you being there. It's fine. Great, even. But my sister—she thinks it's going to be glamorous and exciting. My mother thinks it's going to be dangerous and inappropriate."
"If you bring her, I'll watch her. Personally. Like a hawk. Make sure nobody bothers her, make sure she stays out of trouble. But honestly, if you have such a high opinion of Ian—and you clearly do—then the party shouldn't really pose any threats to young girls, right? Ian would never allow anything inappropriate to happen."
"That's... actually a good point."
"I know. I have them occasionally."
"Ian would be horrified if anyone behaved inappropriately around Ema. He'd shut it down immediately."
"Exactly. So maybe your mom's fears aren't as relevant here as she thinks."
Rus was right. Nothing untoward would happen under Ian's watch, but that didn't make convincing his mother any easier.
Back at home that afternoon, Jay called his mother. The conversation went on for over an hour.
"Mom, listen. I know you're worried—"
"Worried? Jay, she has no business at an event like that."
"I'll be there. Ian will be there. My friend Rus already promised to watch her specifically."
"You don't understand what these people are like."
"I work with these people every day."
"That's different. You're an adult. You can handle yourself. Ema is a child who thinks everything is glamorous and exciting. She doesn't see danger until it's too late."
"She's going to resent us both if we say no."
"Let her resent me. I'm her mother. I'm supposed to protect her, not give her what she wants."
"What if it's just a party and she has a nice time and comes home safe?"
"And what if it isn't? What if someone pays too much attention to her? What if she gets ideas about a life she can't have?"
Jay didn't know how to answer that. The fear in his mother's voice was too deep, too rooted in experiences he didn't fully understand.
"Can we just think about it? We don't have to decide right now."
"There's nothing to think about."
"Mom—"
"I have to go. We'll talk later."
She hung up before he could respond. Jay stared at his phone, exhausted by the argument he couldn't win and didn't entirely want to.
The final fitting was scheduled for that same afternoon. Jay arrived at the tailor's shop feeling wrung out from the phone call. The tailor greeted him with and led him to the fitting room. Three suits hung waiting—one black, severe and formal, the other two in lighter shades of charcoal and navy, classic and elegant.
"Try the black one first," the tailor instructed.
Jay changed and examined himself in the mirrors. The suit fit perfectly. Every line, every angle, every proportion exactly right.  The other two suits were equally perfect. Almost no adjustments needed. The tailor made notes, confirmed delivery dates, and sent Jay home with the knowledge that his collection of expensive, perfectly tailored suits was now comprehensive enough for any conceivable occasion.
The final week of August drifted by. Tia Larson's start date was confirmed for the first week of September, and Jay once again prepared onboarding materials.
The Tuesday jogs continued. Jay's form showed barely any improvement—he still struggled through the last third, still arrived at the bench breathing hard, but at least it was becoming less awkward now.
Friday dinner also happened naturally. Jay did his best not to mope about the party situation, though he couldn't help pouting dramatically.
"Leo is ruining my life."
"That seems excessive."
"He's been unreachable for two weeks. Two weeks. Who does that?"
"Leo, apparently. Though in fairness, Leo's always been erratic about communication."
"He invited a child to a formal gala without asking permission. He invited people I barely know. He disappeared for two weeks. I'm not being excessive."
"You really are upset with him."
"I'm furious with him."
"It's a little endearing."
"Don't encourage him by finding this amusing."
"For what it's worth, I think your sister would be safe at the party. But I understand your mother's concerns."
"Do you?"
"Protective instincts don't always align with logic. Sometimes fear is just fear, regardless of whether it's justified."
"She has reasons."
"I'm sure she does."
They didn't discuss it further. The evening continued pleasantly, and when Ian drove Jay home, the week didn't seem that gloomy anymore.
Sunday morning, Leo finally answered his phone.
"Jay! How are you?"
"How am I? How am I? Leo, I've been trying to reach you for two weeks!"
"I was traveling. My phone was off."
"You invited my sister to the party!"
"She seemed enthusiastic about it."
"She's sixteen!"
"So? She'll be supervised. What's the problem?"
Jay wanted to reach through the phone and strangle him. "The problem is you didn't ask me first. The problem is my mother is furious. The problem is you're making decisions about my family without consulting me."
"You're being melodramatic."
"I'm being—" Jay stopped, forced himself to breathe. "Leo, this isn't okay."
"Jay, nothing bad is going to happen. Ian is the most proper man in the district. Your sister will be at a party attended by respectable people, with you present, with Ian present, probably with half the office present. What exactly do you think is going to happen?"
Jay couldn't actually answer that. When Leo laid it out that way, his mother's fears did sound abstract.
"She might not even be allowed to come," Jay said finally.
"Then she won't. Problem solved. Look, I'm sorry I didn't ask first. But I thought it would be fine. And I was unavailable because I was abroad hunting for Ian's birthday gift. Which, by the way, is spectacular."
"What kind of gift?"
"Can't tell you. It's a surprise. But I had to go to three different countries to track it down."
"Three countries?"
"Worth every kilometre. Ian's going to love it."
After they hung up, Jay sat on his couch and stared at the wall. Three countries. Leo had traveled to three different countries to find Ian's birthday gift. Jay's gift suddenly felt desperately inadequate.
He stood up and went to his kitchen cupboards, pulling out jars and bottles and packets of herbs. The tinctures he'd made were looking good, but not special enough. Not when competing with whatever Leo had hunted down across three countries. 
He'd try harder. He opened his laptop and started ordering new ingredients. Alpine herbs, unusual spices, along with a dozen more jars. Things he could infuse quickly, experiment with, create variations. Different ratios, different bases, blind experimentation with the hope that something would turn out exceptional.
His cupboards were already overflowing, jars lined every available surface. Half of them eventually migrated to the basement storage when there was simply no room left in his apartment. But it still felt like it wasn't enough. 
He pulled up his laptop and resumed searching. Gifts for people who appreciate classical music. Concert tickets. Music boxes. First edition scores.
Everything was either too generic or required more time than Jay had left. He was starting to panic.
Scene 4
Tia Larson
September brought cooler mornings and the first hints of gold in the trees. Amy and Luc returned on Monday, both looking refreshed.
Kim and Ela departed together, no longer pretending their joint leave was coincidental. They'd chosen a mountain getaway in the late summer warmth, Kim showing photos of the charming cabin they'd rented while Ela made comments about finally getting proper rest.
The office reshuffled to accommodate the changes. And into this transition walked Rin's salvation.
"Thank god you're back. I've been surrounded by people who either ignore me or terrify me for two weeks," Rin said, appearing at Luc's desk within seconds.
Luc set down his bag with theatrical gravity. "Fear not, young apprentice. Your mentor has returned from his journey across distant lands. Did you miss me?"
"Yes." The answer was completely earnest.
"Well then, gather round young one, and let me tell you tales of my adventures. There were bears. Possibly. I saw something large and brown. Could have been a dog."
Jay watched from his desk as Rin pulled up a chair and Luc launched into an increasingly exaggerated account of his camping trip. Within minutes, Rin was laughing.
Jay walked over. "Welcome back."
"Jay! You survived without me. I'm almost offended by how well the office functioned in my absence."
"We barely managed. There was crying. Possibly mine."
"As there should be. How was August? Anything exciting happen?"
"Define exciting."
"Anything that would make a good story."
"Then no. Completely boring. We just worked."
"Lies. You're a terrible liar." Luc turned to Rin. "Was he lying?"
"Absolutely," Rin said immediately.
"Traitor," Jay said dramatically.
They bantered for a few more minutes before Jay returned to his desk. The office felt more balanced with Luc back—his voice filling spaces that had seemed too quiet.
But Monday also brought another addition.
Tia Larson arrived at nine o'clock. Jay and Ian met her in the lobby. She was tall, straight-backed, with short dark hair and a handshake that could crush stone. Her voice was crisp, her stride fast, and everything about her screamed military background.
They'd coordinated the introduction the same way they had for every recent hire—brief but welcoming.
"Tia Larson. Pleased to be here."
"Jay Hall. This is Ian Hagen, CFO."
"Sir. Thank you for the opportunity."
"Welcome to Turner & Associates. Jay will handle your initial orientation. HR will take over for the standard lectures."
They gave her a short tour—the floor layout, the break room, the various departments. Jay tried to balance friendliness with caution. She seemed direct, nothing like Gal. But Jay had learned that first impressions could be deceiving. He'd keep his guard up.
After the brief introduction, he handed her off to HR. Two days of lectures about company policy, benefits, procedures, the standard onboarding process that every new hire endured.
The air was cooler during the Tuesday's jog. Jay noticed it right away—autumn was coming, summer finally loosening its grip.
"How's Tia doing?" Ian asked.
"Hard to say. She's only been here two days, and most of that was HR. I'll know more after this week. I think she will be fine, though. She seems focused. Not the type to cause problems."
They ran in silence for a while, and then Jay said, "It's strange how quickly the seasons change. Feels like summer just started."
"It does."
"Another few weeks and it'll be too cold for comfortable evening runs."
"We'll adjust the schedule. Earlier in the day, perhaps."
"Or move indoors."
"Indoor tracks are depressing."
"Says the man who spends seven days a week in a gym."
"That's different. That's disciplined training. Indoor track running is soul-crushing monotony."
"Fair."
"You must be getting more comfortable if you have this much energy to talk." 
Jay realized he was right. The run still required effort, but he wasn't gasping for air between words anymore. "I guess I'm getting better at this."
They finished the route without further conversation, but Jay felt pleased. He was still tired, still feeling the burn in his muscles, but it was already easier.
Tia adapted quickly through her first week. She was direct, asked questions when she needed clarification, and didn't seem prone to conflict. She completed the HR orientations and transitioned into actual work without drama.
Jay assigned her standard novice tasks—data verification, report formatting, simple analysis reviews. She handled everything well, working diligently through assignments. Her previous finance experience was evident in how quickly she grasped the nuances.
Rin appointed himself unofficial tour guide, showing her the office amenities.
"The coffee machine has twelve settings. It makes everything. Espresso, cappuccino, lattes. There's a setting for foam density. It's incredible."
"Noted," Tia said, amused.
"And the snacks. The snacks are important. The dark chocolate almonds are the best, but the dried mango is also really good. The sea salt crackers are phenomenal. The fruit smoothies are so-so, but Jay seems to love them."
"Essential information."
"I know. I take my responsibilities as tour guide very seriously."
Tia joined the lunch group Wednesday afternoon. Max had led an outing to a sandwich shop he claimed made the best pastrami in the city. The group that assembled included Jay, Tia, Max, Luc, Amy, Rin, Liv and Zoe.
They walked through cooling September air to a hole-in-the-wall shop with questionable decor and amazing smells. Tia integrated into the group without apparent intimidation, taking her place at the crowded table and participating in conversations.
"How are you finding the office so far?" Amy asked.
"Elegenat. Better coffee than my last position. The team seems solid. Everyone I've met has been helpful. Though I notice there's one person who hasn't shown his face—Ray, was it?"
"Ray is... particular," Luc said diplomatically.
"He's antisocial," Max corrected. "Brilliant analyst, terrible human interaction skills. Don't take it personally."
"I don't take much personally."
They ate and talked through lunch. Tia answered questions about her background—military logistics, private sector finance. She asked questions in return about office culture, project dynamics.
Jay watched Tia throughout the meal. She was confident but not domineering, direct but not aggressive. Nothing like Gal. But Jay's wariness remained. First impressions could deceive. He'd stay watchful.
Friday afternoon, Max organized welcome drinks for Tia at their favourite bar. The invitation was casual—come if you want, no pressure, just a few hours of informal socializing.
Jay was comically stiff about the whole thing. He kept remembering Gal at similar gatherings, how normal everything had seemed right up until it wasn't. Ian attended reluctantly. He almost never came to these events, but felt obligated given Tia's position. 
They arrived at six to find Max, Luc, Amy, Zoe, Rin, and Tia already assembled around a large table. Liv appeared shortly after, elegant and smiling. Ray, predictably, never showed.
Ian ordered a single glass of wine. Jay got a beer. They sat at opposite ends of the table, surrounded by the cheerful noise.
Tia, it turned out, could drink like a sailor.
"Another round," she announced after finishing her second beer in twenty minutes.
"Already?" Luc looked impressed.
She proceeded to match Max drink for drink, then surpass him. Luc tried to keep pace and failed spectacularly. Within an hour, both men were visibly drunk while Tia looked unbothered.
"How are you still coherent?" Max asked.
"Superior constitution. Also, I'm pacing myself. You two are not."
Jay stayed on his first beer. Ian left after forty-five minutes. Jay noticed Ian checking the time repeatedly. He assumed Ian was simply unhappy about having to attend, counting down until he could make an exit.
What Jay didn't realize was that Ian was annoyed this gathering was cutting into their Friday dinner. Ian had come to depend on those evenings. This disruption felt disproportionately frustrating, though he tried to act unperturbed.
Liv left shortly after Ian, making graceful excuses and promising to see everyone Monday. The group grew smaller, louder, more relaxed.
By eight o'clock, Luc was actively drunk and Rin had appointed himself caretaker. Max was wobbling and Amy had taken charge of his coordination. Tia remained standing, amused by the situation.
"We should get them home," Jay said to Rin.
"Yeah. Probably."
Amy appeared at Jay's elbow, looking resigned. "I'll help with Max. You two take Luc?"
"Sure."
"I'll help with Max," Tia offered.
"All right then."
They split into groups. Jay and Rin each took one of Luc's arms, leading him to the street where they managed to get a taxi. Luc rambled the entire way about mountains and the meaning of life.
"You're a good friend, Jay. Really good. Don't let anyone tell you different."
"Thanks, Luc."
"And you, Rin. You're gonna be great. Just gotta believe in yourself."
"I'll remember that," Rin said seriously.
They delivered Luc to his apartment, made sure he got inside safely, and headed back out.
"That was eventful," Rin said.
"That's one word for it."
"Tia seems nice though. Different from—" Rin stopped.
"Different from Gal. You can say it."
"Yeah. Very different."
Jay got home at nine-thirty, exhausted and faintly amused. This was certainly an unusual social integration. Tia had held her own and made an impression.
Inside his apartment, Jay checked his bottles. The new experimental batches were progressing—alpine herbs turning the vodka a pale green, creating complex aromas. His gift was expanding beyond what he'd originally planned, but Leo's words still haunted him. Something expensive, something that required international travel.
Jay sealed the cabinet and sat on his couch.
He thought about Friday dinners. He wondered if they would continue, or if tonight had broken the streak. He thought about how much more time they spent together now compared to even a few months ago.
August had been intense, but it had also been full of Ian.
Jay wasn't sure if this was temporary—a strange month of circumstances that pushed them together—or if this was his new reality. If these patterns would continue or gradually fade back to how it was before.
He was too afraid to think about it more deeply. Too afraid that whatever this thing between him and Ian was, it was too fragile to survive scrutiny. That examining it too closely would make it collapse.
Two more weeks until Ian's birthday party.
Each passing day made him feel more scared than excited. The gift he'd been making felt inadequate. The party felt too large, too formal. His sister might or might not be allowed to attend, creating potential drama. Leo had invited half the city, apparently. And through it all, Jay would have to smile and pretend he was just Ian's assistant, just a colleague, just someone who happened to care about whether the evening went well.
Scene 5
Daring outfit
The weekend brought the party back into sharp focus. Two weeks away. Fourteen days.
Jay stood in his kitchen surrounded by jars of tinctures, tasting each one. This one was too bitter. That one lacked depth. Another was interesting but not special. Nothing felt good enough.
He revisited his notes, reading through combinations and steeping times, trying to identify where he'd gone wrong. The alpine herbs should have added complexity. But the results were just—fine. Not amazing.
Jay tried to be objective. These were nice liquors, but they were still homemade. Still amateur compared to what someone could buy from a proper distillery. Childish. That's what they felt like. A child's art project presented to an adult who deserved so much better.
He'd placed an order for crystal bottles—hand-carved, art deco style, breathtakingly expensive—hoping that presentation might compensate for the contents. He'd also ordered a wooden display box, something elegant to hold the collection. At least it would look presentable.
He opened his laptop and searched desperately for alternatives. The results were the same as always—expensive watches, first edition books, art pieces. Things Ian either already owned or wouldn't want. Things Jay couldn't afford even with his increased salary.
He closed the laptop and stared at the jars again. Two more weeks. Hopefully at least some of these mixtures would turn out good enough.
Sunday afternoon, Ema called again. Jay almost didn't answer—he'd received three texts from her that day already, each more dramatic than the last.
"Please, Jay. Please let me go to the party."
"Ema—"
"It might be my one chance. My one chance in my entire life to go to a real ball, like in books. To have a memory I'll keep forever. Please. I'll do anything. I'll follow every rule. I won't embarrass you. Please."
The desperation in her voice cracked something in him. She wanted magic and glamour and a single evening of feeling special.
"Alright."
"What?"
"You can come. But there are conditions."
"Anything!"
"You stay with me at all times. You don't drink alcohol. You don't go anywhere alone. You're respectful and polite. And if I say it's time to leave, we leave. No arguments."
"Yes! Yes, I promise. Thank you, Jay. Thank you so much!"
"And if anyone makes you uncomfortable, you tell me immediately."
"I will. I swear."
"I'll talk to Mom."
Ema burst into tears, but this time they sounded like relief. "Thank you. Thank you so much."
"Don't thank me yet. Mom still has to agree."
She hung up, and Jay sat staring at his phone, wondering what he'd just agreed to. Convincing his mother was harder. The conversation lasted nearly two hours, tense and circular.
"You don't understand what you're asking," she said.
"I do understand."
"Jay—" 
"I know how dangerous people can be. I know exactly how dangerous. If I had any doubts about the integrity of these people, any doubts at all, I would never consider bringing Ema. But I don't have doubts. These are good people. Nothing inappropriate will happen."
"You can't control everything."
"No, but I can control who she's near and where she goes. She'll be with me the entire time. Or with Rus, who's built like a mountain and extremely protective. She'll be safe, Mom. I promise."
"You really believe that?"
"I do."
"Fine. But if anything goes wrong—"
"It won't."
"If it does, this is on you."
"I know."
After they hung up, Jay received a text from Ema: "MOM SAID YES!!! CAN I BRING LAM???? THE INVITATION SAYS PLUS ONE!!!"
Jay stared at the message. Two sixteen-year-olds. This was going to be a disaster.
He texted back: "Yes. Same rules apply to her."
"THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU I LOVE YOU!!!"
That evening, Jay tried on his suits.
The black one looked severe. The blue was better but still conservative. The gray made him think of that disastrous evening when someone had compared him to a funeral director. None of them felt right. They were all too serious, too staid.
He needed something different. Something stylish and modern and bold. Something that would let him stand among Ian's refined friends without feeling like a provincial pretender. 
Monday afternoon, Jay left work at five—earlier than he'd left on a Monday in months, and walked straight to Hathaway's Menswear.
The clerk greeted him immediately, smiling like they were old friends. "Good afternoon. Lovely to see you again."
"I need something for an event. Something dashing, but less formal."
"I assume you mean Mr. Hagen's birthday celebration?"
"How did you know that?"
"It's the talk of the district. Our shop is directly across from the Northlight Financial Center. I've seen you leave with Mr. Hagen on multiple occasions. And he's not exactly anonymous."
"Right. Of course."
"I'm Eli, by the way. I don't think I properly introduced myself last time."
"Jay Hall."
"A pleasure. So. Mr. Hagen's fortieth birthday gala. What kind of impression are you hoping to make?"
"I want to look stunning. Budget is not a concern."
"Excellent. Let's see what we can do."
For the next two hours, Jay tried on outfit after outfit. Eli pulled pieces Jay would never have chosen himself—jackets with interesting cuts, shirts in unexpected colors, pants that fit differently than anything Jay owned.
Finally, they settled on something daring. A blazer with a subtle floral pattern, elegant but eye-catching. A shirt with the top buttons deliberately left open, no tie. Pants that were, as Eli delicately put it, "very flattering to your proportions."
Jay stared at himself in the mirror. He looked stylish.
"You look spectacular. Trust me on this."
"The blazer isn't too much?"
"It's exactly enough. You'll stand out, but in the right way. You'll be the best-dressed person in that room."
"I doubt that." 
"Then you'll be in the top five. Which is impressive at an event where everyone will be dressed to kill. I know a hairstylist. Very talented. I'll arrange an appointment for you on the day of the party. He'll finish the look perfectly."
"That's—that's very generous."
"You're a good customer, Mr. Hall. And honestly, I'd love to see how this turns out."
The price was exorbitant but bearable. The occasion justified the cost.
He paid, arranged for tailoring adjustments, and exchanged phone numbers with Eli for coordination about the hairstylist.
"How can I repay you for all this help?" Jay asked.
Eli laughed. "An invitation to the party would be ideal. I've heard it's going to be the event of the season, but I'll settle for a bottle of good alcohol if you insist."
Jay hesitated. "I could probably arrange an invitation. If you're serious."
"Are you sure? I'd hate to impose."
"You've been incredibly helpful. And apparently half the city is already invited."
"Then I'd be honored. Thank you."
They shook hands and Jay left, feeling simultaneously relieved and anxious. One problem solved, at least partially.
But the gift still gave him a headache. And now he was wondering if inviting Eli was reckless. He barely knew him. What if he caused some kind of commotion? But he'd been helpful, and Jay appreciated it. And Eli had been nothing but professional and kind during all their interactions.
Tuesday evening, Ian met him at the park for their run. Jay arrived on time, still feeling slightly off-balance from the shopping trip.
They started jogging, and after a few minutes, Ian spoke.
"You left early yesterday."
"Yeah. I had an errand."
"Everything all right?"
"Fine. I just went shopping."
Jay decided to change the subject before Ian could probe further. "I convinced my mother to let Ema attend the party."
"You did?"
"After multiple conversations and a long list of conditions, yes. She'll be bringing her best friend Lam. Both are absolutely thrilled about attending a real ball. I'm completely responsible for their safety and behavior. No pressure."
"That was generous of you. I know you had reservations."
"I still have reservations. But Ema was so excited. And you were right—with proper supervision, it should be fine."
They ran in silence for a while. Then Jay spoke again, keeping his voice casual.
"Actually, speaking of the party—would you mind if I invited one more person? An acquaintance."
"Of course not. Invite whoever you'd like."
"Are you sure? I don't want to—"
"It's fine. The more people celebrating, the better."
"Thank you. I appreciate it."
"Of course."
That evening, Ian sat at his kitchen table with untouched dinner in front of him. Jay had invited someone to the party. An acquaintance. Another relationship that took precedence over whatever undefined thing existed between them.
It was unreasonable to feel jealous. Ian pushed his plate away and tried to talk himself out of the feeling, but the jealousy remained, petty and insistent, making him feel small and selfish and utterly pathetic.
He went to bed early, trying not to acknowledge how desperately he wanted to be the only person Jay thought to invite to important occasions. Trying not to admit how much he wanted Jay's time, attention, and affection to be his alone.
