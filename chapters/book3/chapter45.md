Chapter 45: Steam and stars
Scene 1
Salt-ocean smell
The autumn air cut through Jay's coat as he stepped out of the metro station Monday morning. The chill was welcome, sharp enough to clear his head. He walked to Northlight Financial Center with his heart doing somersaults in his chest. He'd been gone two days, and he felt ridiculous about how much he wanted to see Ian again.
Jay arrived early, but he didn't go straight to his desk. Instead he walked to the window and looked down at the street below, scanning the morning traffic for Ian's car. He stayed there, watching, aware he was being absurd but unable to help himself.
A silver car turned the corner.
Jay straightened. The car pulled into the underground parking entrance and disappeared from view. He counted the time it would take to park, walk to the elevator, ride up. His pulse quickened.
Ian walked in, and their eyes met. They both smiled, each trying to conceal the relief of seeing the other, but the joy was impossible to mask despite their best attempts.
"Good morning," Ian said, crossing the space between them.
"Morning," Jay replied, trying to sound casual and failing completely.
"How was the trip?"
"Tiring, but good. Tim loved the car. The party was fun. The train ride home was long. I slept most of it."
"You should have taken an extra day to rest."
"No. I mean, I wanted to be back. For work. To prepare for the hot springs trip."
They stood there, both smiling like idiots, until Amy's arrival broke the spell. Then Ian moved toward his office, and Jay turned to his computer.
“A bit early,” she said, setting down her bag. “Wanted to get ahead of everything.”
Jay nodded. “Yeah, good call.”
Soon everyone was hard at work preparing for the upcoming trip. The departure was planned for Friday morning, which meant the team wanted to ensure no backlog would greet them when they returned. Tasks were completed efficiently, everything put in order.
No one worried about falling behind. The atmosphere was light, energized by anticipation. Everyone looked forward to the weekend.
Wednesday afternoon, Jay left went shopping. Warm sweaters, gloves, thick socks. He bought a fluffy hat with earflaps that made him look slightly ridiculous but would definitely keep him warm.
Thursday evening he packed, laying everything out on his bed first. Casual clothes, resort-appropriate items, a suit just in case something formal came up. The warm sweaters went in first, then everything else. He was done in half an hour, no longer agonizing over every choice. Whatever he brought would be adequate.
Friday morning, Ian picked him up after breakfast. Jay waited outside his building, watching Ian's car pull up to the curb.
"Ready?" Ian asked as Jay climbed in.
"Ready."
They drove straight to the airport, arriving to find most of the team already gathering near the departure terminal. Luc was talking animatedly to Rin. Ela and Kim stood together near the entrance. Zoe and Amy were checking their tickets.
Then Ray appeared, and everyone stopped talking. He stood there with a large backpack, surveying the terminal. 
Luc recovered first. "Ray. You're coming?"
"Yes." 
"But you never—you don't do company trips." 
"I love hot springs," Ray said laconically.
The words were delivered so flatly that Jay couldn't tell if he was serious. Apparently no one else could either, judging by the shocked looks being exchanged. Ray loved hot springs? Or had Leo threatened him again?
The flight to Ashland took two hours. Boarding and disembarking took longer than the flight itself—the shuffle of luggage, passengers, security checks. 
Jay sat by the window, watching the landscape beneath them. Ian sat beside him, reading something on his tablet. Every so often Jay would glance over. Ian would look back, smile slightly, and return to his reading.
The plane descended smoothly. They landed with barely a bump, and then everyone was gathering bags and filing out into the terminal into air so fresh and cold it stung. Jay tugged on his new hat immediately.
"Nice hat," Ian said.
"It's warm."
"It has earflaps."
"I know what it has."
Ian's mouth twitched, but he didn't say anything else.
A bus waited outside the airport to transport them to their accommodations. The drive took forty minutes along winding coastal roads, the ocean visible through breaks in the rocky landscape. The air smelled like salt and stone.
Finally, the resort appeared, a sprawling modern structure of glass and wood built into the cliff side. It was small, visibly exclusive, with only a few other guests walking the grounds. Everything looked pristine and sophisticated. The ocean roared below. The wind was fierce here, whipping hair and coats as they climbed out. 
A hostess greeted them in the lobby.
"Welcome to Frostbay Sanctuary. You'll be staying in our two-person suites, each with a private balcony and ocean view. Mr. Turner has arranged everything. If you'll follow me, I'll show you to your rooms, and then we'll go over the facilities and schedule."
She distributed key cards—Rin with Ray, which made Rin's face light up with barely contained joy. Luc with Max. Liv with Tia. Ela and Kim together as usual. Zoe with Amy. And Ian with Jay.
No one complained about the arrangements. The resort was incredibly beautiful, everything fresh and meticulously maintained, the air carrying that persistent salt-ocean smell that made everything feel clean.
They were shown to their rooms—spacious, modern, with minimalist furniture and stone accents. The bathroom featured a high-tech spa tub with more settings than Jay could immediately parse.
After lunch in the resort's dining room—fresh seafood and local produce prepared simply—they changed into swimsuits in their suite, wrapping themselves in the enormous white bathrobes provided by the resort. They headed down to the pool area, following the signs toward the largest soaking pool. The hostess met them there and launched into an explanation of the facility.
"The water is rich in minerals and very good for the skin, though I recommend keeping your hair dry if possible. The clay at the bottom has excellent health benefits. Feel free to apply it anywhere. The pools are quite warm, around forty degrees, so take breaks if you need them. Otherwise, just relax and enjoy."
The pool stretched out before them, its water an impossible turquoise blue. Steam rose from the surface in wisps, dissipating into the cold air. Several smaller pools dotted the area, and further down the cliff Jay could see another pool directly adjacent to the ocean, waves crashing just meters away.
They shed their robes quickly and entered the water to escape the chill. The heat was immediate and intense, sinking into muscles and bones. 
Ray was already in the main pool, stationed in a corner with a contented expression, enthusiastically smearing clay across his arms.
Rin appeared beside Jay, watching Ray with delight. "Did you see? He's actually smiling."
"I don't think that's a smile," Jay said.
"It's close enough."
Rin positioned himself near Ray, copying his clay application with exaggerated movements. Ray glanced at him but said nothing, which Rin apparently took as permission to continue.
Luc floated around the pool, completely disregarding the fact that he was supposed to mind his hair, which was getting progressively wetter and more disheveled.
Jay splashed around for a few minutes, feeling the hot water immediately relax muscles that had been unnaturally tense lately—though he hadn't quite realized how tense until until the warmth began to undo it. The heat worked its way through his shoulders, his back, his legs. 
Finally, he found a spot near Ian, who had chosen a stone seat along the pool's side. Jay sank down beside him, the water deep enough to cover their shoulders. It felt blissful.
They reclined against the smooth stone, the water lapping gently around them, steam rising into the cold air above. Ian's eyes were closed, his expression peaceful.
The heat melted away everything—the missed Friday dinners, the stress of the quarter, the constant low-level anxiety. Here, in the steaming water with the cold air on his face and Ian beside him, none of it mattered. He could stay like this for hours.


Scene 2
Aurora
They soaked for about two hours, taking short breaks to step out into the chilly air for water and to cool down before plunging back into the heat. The heat worked its way deep into Jay's bones, leaving him loose and heavy in the best way. Around him, the team had spread out across the pool, some chatting, others floating in silence.
Eventually Ela climbed out, wrapping herself in her robe. "I think I'm done. Any more and I'll melt completely."
"Agreed," Amy said, following her.
One by one they extracted themselves from the water. Jay felt boneless as he wrapped himself in his robe, the cold air shocking after the pool's heat.
"We should walk before dinner. The views are supposed to be incredible," Zoe said.
"It's freezing," Kim pointed out.
"That's what coats are for."
They returned to their rooms to bundle up properly. Jay layered his warmest sweater under his coat, added his new scarf and gloves, and headed down the path toward the ocean. The wind was cutting through layers, but the landscape was worth it. The sun had already set, leaving the sky a deep indigo streaked with the last traces of orange. Stars were beginning to appear overhead, brighter than they ever were in the city. The horizon stretched endlessly, the island's cliffs rising dark and dramatic against the fading light.
Zoe was excited. "We have to hike tomorrow. Look at this terrain—there are trails everywhere."
"In this cold?" Ela asked, pulling her coat tighter.
"It's great hiking weather. Cold but not too cold. We'll warm up once we start moving."
"I'm in," Luc said immediately.
Ray, walking a few paces behind, spoke up. "There's a route that passes several natural hot springs at the base of the cliffs."
"We're doing that one," Zoe agreed.
They walked for another twenty minutes, boots crunching on stones, until the cold became uncomfortable, then retreated toward the warmth of the main building. Jay's face felt frozen, his fingers numb, but he was smiling.
Dinner was served in a room with a massive fireplace crackling at one end. The table was low to the ground, surrounded by plush pillows instead of chairs. They sat awkwardly at first, trying to find comfortable positions, but the informality suited the mood. Everyone was in casual clothes, even Ian wearing a loose cream sweater.
The food was hearty—thick stews with root vegetables and tender meat, herbal breads still warm from the oven, salads with sharp vinaigrette, small dishes of pickled vegetables and creamy butter. Jay took a piece of bread, dunked it into the stew, bit down and immediately sighed deeply in appreciation. 
"This is incredible."
"It's good," Ian agreed.
Jay wasn't interested in restraint. He sprawled gracelessly on the floor cushion, no longer caring about presentation, and devoted himself entirely to the food. The bread was great for soaking up every drop of stew, and he stuffed his mouth full without apology. Between bites he kept declaring, "This is heaven. Actually heaven."
Ian sat properly upright beside him, watching Jay eat with undisguised fondness. Jay was too absorbed in his dinner to notice, making happy noises over the food. It was unbelievably endearing.
Around them, the team had fallen into their own conversations. Rin was making a valiant attempt to engage Ray, asking about different hot spring minerals and water temperatures. Surprisingly, Ray kept responding, commenting about the pools and tomorrow's planned activities.
"The wild pools have different mineral content than the resort ones. More sulphur."
"Oh, that's interesting. "Do you soak often? Back home, I mean?"
"Sometimes."
It was like watching someone try to befriend a particularly taciturn cat, Jay thought. But Ray seemed more open, perhaps mellowed by hours in hot water.
Tia sat between Luc and Max, all three of them drinking ice-cold vodka from small glasses. Ela watched them with disapproval.
"You're going to regret that tomorrow," she said.
"That's tomorrow's problem," Max replied cheerfully, pouring another round.
Kim laughed. "Let them suffer. It'll be entertaining."
Zoe had her phone out, map pulled up, tracing routes with one finger. "If we leave early we can hit three viewpoints before lunch. The second one overlooks the cliffs on the eastern side."
At the far end of the table, Amy and Liv were discussing something work-related. Max caught wind of it and called out, "No work talk! We're supposed to relax and forget about the office."
Amy waved him off. "We're just talking about process improvements."
"That's still work!"
Jay laughed, taking another piece of bread. "This is amazing. I never want to leave."
Ian smiled at that, sitting straight-backed while Jay sprawled beside him like a contented cat. "You're going to make yourself sick."
"Worth it."
As full darkness fell, the hostess appeared at the door. "If you're interested, the aurora is visible tonight. We have a viewing pool at the ocean's edge—it's a bit of a walk, but the perspective is spectacular."
Everyone agreed immediately and hurried to their rooms to grab bathrobes and towels. Luc and Max were noticeably unsteady, the vodka having done its work, but they insisted they were fine.
"I'm not missing the aurora because I had a few drinks," Luc declared, swaying slightly.
Ray led the group down the lantern-lit path toward the ocean, moving with surprising confidence through the dark. The temperature had dropped further, the wind bitter and unrelenting. Jay huddled into his robe, walking quickly to keep warm.
The pool appeared at the edge of a rocky outcrop, steam rising dramatically into the cold air. It was darker than the main pool, the water appearing almost black in the dim light, and it sat directly adjacent to the ocean. Waves crashed just meters away, spray occasionally misting over the rocks.
They shed their robes and practically dove into the water, gasping with relief as the heat enveloped them. The pool was deep, the bottom smooth stone, the water almost too hot, borderline painful, but after the freezing air it felt incredible.
Above them the aurora unfurled. Green light rippled across the sky in waves, brightening and fading, joined by threads of purple and blue. It moved like it was alive, shimmering and folding. The stars were everywhere, brilliant in the absence of city light.
The pool's lighting was minimal, designed not to interfere with the view, revealing just enough to show the spectacular setting—hot spring water meeting the edge of the ocean.
"Holy shit," Luc whispered.
Jay couldn't speak. He tilted his head back and watched the lights dance. The ocean roared beside them, cold spray drifting over the edge of the pool. He drifted toward the ocean, drawn by the juxtaposition, and reached out experimentally, extending one hand toward the seawater. The cold hit like a shock and he yanked his hand back with a yelp.
Ian chuckled. "What did you expect?"
"I don't know. Not that."
The contrast was absurd. The water they sat in was blisteringly hot, while inches away the ocean was near freezing. The two existed side by side, separated by a thin wall of stone. Above them the aurora continued its display, colours bleeding across the sky. The stars gleamed between the curtains of light. Jay could hear the ocean, smell the salt, feel the steam on his face and the heat surrounding his body. This was the most beautiful thing he'd ever witnessed. Nothing else came close.
They stayed for an hour, watching the lights fade and intensify, fade and intensify. Eventually the hostess returned, reminding them not to overdo it. They climbed out reluctantly, wrapping themselves in the robes and hurrying back up the path. The wind was worse now, vicious and unrelenting. Jay's hair was still wet and the cold made his scalp ache.
Back in their suite, Ian disappeared into the bathroom first, showering quickly. Jay waited his turn, then eyed the enormous spa bath tucked in the corner.
"I'm taking a bath," he announced.
"Don't fall asleep in there."
Jay filled the huge tub, dumping in bath salts until the water turned milky. He climbed in and sank down with a groan. The tub had jets and he turned them all on, fiddling with the settings until the water churned around him. It was absurd. He had a bath at home now, used it regularly, but this was different. The jets pulsed against his back and he grinned stupidly at nothing.
When he finally emerged, wrapped in the resort's plush robe, Ian had opened a bottle of local wine and was reading in one of the chairs by the window.
"There's a glass for you," Ian said, gesturing to the nightstand.
Jay grabbed the wine and collapsed onto his bed, sprawling across the covers without bothering to arrange himself properly. The wine was crisp and cold, perfectly complementing the lingering heat in his muscles from the bath.
"This place is incredible," he announced to the ceiling. 
"Leo has excellent taste when he applies himself," Ian replied.
"The aurora was unreal. Did you see how bright it got near the end? And those colours. The pools are amazing. The food is amazing. The air smells amazing. Even the cold is great."
"You're very enthusiastic tonight."
"I don't think I've been this relaxed in my life."
"I'm glad."
They talked about the wind and the food. Jay's words came slower, his sentences trailing off. The wine and the heat and the long day made eyelids heavy, the comfort of the bed pulling him down. He didn't notice when he fell asleep. One moment he was talking, the next he was gone, glass still half full on the floor beside the bed.
Ian retrieved a blanket from the closet and draped it over him. Jay didn't stir. Ian stood there for a moment, watching him. 
When was the last time Ian had felt this happy? He couldn't remember. Maybe never. Certainly not in recent years. Watching Jay sleep, knowing they had an entire weekend ahead in this beautiful place, filled him with bliss. Not the fleeting kind that came and went, but a bone-deep contentment.
Scene 3
Very interesting wood
Breakfast was lively, Zoe dominating the conversation with her phone in hand, swiping through trail maps and photos of dramatic cliff formations.
"This route goes along the eastern ridge. Incredible views, and there's a natural arch about three kilometres in."
"What about this one? It passes four wild springs," Ray asked, pointing to a different path.
"But the views aren't as good."
"The springs are better."
"We could combine them. Take the ridge path to the arch, then loop back through the spring valley. If we leave now and pack food."
"I'm coming with you," Rin said.
"Me too," Luc said, shoveling eggs into his mouth.
Max shook his head. "Too ambitious for me. I'll take the easy route."
"Same. I'm here to relax, not march through the wilderness," Kim agreed. 
Jay focused on his breakfast, already dreading the cold. The dining room was warm, but he could see the frost on the windows. The weather had dropped even further overnight.
After breakfast they all returned to their rooms to prepare. Jay layered his warmest sweater under his winter coat, added his scarf and fluffy hat and gloves. He decided this should be adequate. The coat had served him well through city winters.
They gathered in the lobby, and Jay immediately felt under-dressed. Zoe wore what looked like mountaineering gear, with technical fabrics and insulated layers. Ray's jacket was similar, designed for serious cold. Even Luc had a proper winter hiking coat, thick and wind-resistant.
"Everyone ready?" Zoe asked.
They stepped outside into air so cold it hurt to breathe. Jay's eyes watered immediately. He pulled his scarf tighter and told himself it would be fine once they started moving.
The trail began gently, leading away from the resort along the cliff edge. The wind was relentless, whipping across the exposed landscape with nothing to stop it. Jay's teeth started chattering within the first ten minutes. His coat was clearly insufficient for this harsh northern weather. He eyed his coworkers' technical jackets with growing distrust of his own choices.
At the first junction, Zoe outlined the plan. "Ray, Rin, Luc and I are taking the longer route to the springs. The rest of you can take this path up the hill—shorter, but the view from the top is supposed to be beautiful."
"Sounds good," Amy agreed.
The groups split, Zoe's team heading off while the rest began the ascent up the smaller hill. The climb wasn't difficult, but the cold was brutal. Jay focused on putting one foot in front of the other, trying to ignore how much he was shaking.
"You okay?" Ian appeared beside him, looking annoyingly comfortable in a sleek dark jacket.
"Fine," Jay managed through chattering teeth.
Ten minutes later, Ian checked again. "Jay?"
"I'm fine."
"Jay, you're turning blue."
"Just cold. It's fine."
Another ten minutes passed. Jay's nose was running and he couldn't feel his toes. Ian stopped walking and turned to face him.
"We're going back."
"What? No. I can keep going."
"You're about to drop dead from hypothermia. We're returning to the resort."
"Ian, I'm fine, really—"
"Jay."
Jay wanted to protest further, but honestly he was miserable. The cold had worked its way deep into his bones, and he couldn't feel his fingers anymore.
"Okay," he admitted.
Ian called ahead to Amy. "We're heading back. Jay's too cold."
"See you at lunch," Amy shouted back.
The walk back seemed longer than the walk out. Jay concentrated on moving, keeping his arms wrapped around himself for whatever warmth he could generate. Ian stayed close beside him. When they finally reached the resort, Jay practically fell through the door.
"Come on," Ian said, steering him toward their suite.
In their room, Jay collapsed into a chair and pulled off his gloves with numb fingers. "I don't understand. Why wasn't anyone else bothered by the freezing cold?"
"Because we wore appropriate gear."
"I was wearing my warmest sweater."
Ian was pulling off his jacket. Underneath he wore a regular sweater, but when he lifted it slightly Jay saw another layer beneath. "Thermal underwear. You need base layers for this kind of weather."
Jay stared at the garment. "Thermal underwear?"
"Yes. You wear it under your regular clothes. It traps body heat."
Of course Ian had known about proper gear. Ian probably owned an entire collection of technical clothing for every conceivable weather condition.
"I didn't know that existed. I thought the sweater would be enough. Next time, tell me I need thermal underwear before I almost die."
"I assumed you knew."
"Why would I know? I'm from a small town in the south. We don't have extreme weather."
"Noted. Next time, I'll provide a full equipment list. Hot spring?"
"Yes. Please. Immediately."
They changed and made their way down to the pool area, this time choosing one of the smaller, secluded pools tucked away from the main complex. Jay descended into the hot water with a groan, the heat immediately working on his frozen muscles.
"This is better. This is so much better."
The pool was peaceful, the sound of waves distant. Jay felt his body slowly returning to normal, warmth replacing the bone-deep chill. By the time they returned to the main building for lunch, Jay had recovered completely. The rest of the team was already there, eating and chatting. Jay slid into his seat and immediately launched into his complaints.
"No one told me I needed thermal underwear. I didn't even know that was a thing people wore."
Kim laughed. "You went hiking in arctic wind without base layers?"
"I had my warmest sweater."
"Oh, Jay. You poor thing," Ela shook her head.
"I even brought heating pads, but I still wouldn't hike as far as Zoe's platoon," Kim added.
Tia agreed. "I had enough discomfort during my military years. I much prefer the pampering activities now. You won't catch me freezing on a mountain."
"Smart," Jay muttered into his soup.
After lunch people split off to explore the resort. Liv, Amy, Ela, and Tia went to book spa treatments. Max and Kim discovered a pool table in a rec room and disappeared immediately.
Ian looked at Jay. "Want to explore?"
"Sure."
They wandered through the resort, discovering various amenities. A library, a meditation room, several smaller pools in addition to the main ones. Eventually they found a terrace overlooking the ocean, equipped with gas outdoor heaters and thick blankets arranged on oversized armchairs.
"This is great," Jay said, claiming a chair near one of the heaters.
Staff appeared with a pot of hot spicy tea and big ceramic cups. Jay wrapped both hands around his cup and pulled a blanket over his legs.
The sun hung low in the sky, beginning its slow descent toward the horizon. The volcanic rocks below were dark and alien-looking, water crashing against them endlessly. The salt smell was strong here, carried on the wind that no longer felt quite so hostile thanks to the heaters.
They watched the light change, the sky turning from pale blue to pink at the edges. The ocean reflected the colours, turning gold where the sun touched it. Jay had seen sunsets before, but this place made it feel different, more vivid.
They stayed on the terrace until the light began to fade. The temperature dropped with the sun, but the heaters and blankets kept them comfortable. Jay felt utterly content, the disasters of the morning hike forgotten in the warmth and beauty of the afternoon.
The adventurous group returned shortly before dinner, shaking from the cold, red-faced and grinning. Even Ray looked accomplished, which was remarkable.
"That was incredible. The most beautiful ridge view I've ever seen.," Zoe announced.
"It was freezing," Luc added.
"We need sauna. Immediately. Before dinner. Nothing heats better than sauna. We need to unfreeze our cores," Ray said.
Everyone stopped and stared. Ray barely spoke, but here he was, actively demanding sauna time, looking almost animated about it.
"Sauna it is," Max agreed, clearly not wanting to miss this unprecedented moment.
The first time Ray had shown enthusiasm for anything social, no one was going to refuse. The group reconvened, everyone heading to their rooms to prepare. Jay walked beside Ian, feeling his stomach start to tie itself in knots.
"The sauna is communal?" he asked.
"Yes."
"And. Traditional. In the northern style."
"Naked, yes."
Sauna culture wasn't big in Jay's hometown. He knew it was popular in the north, he'd just never actually done it. Sitting naked next to coworkers seemed like a big ask. Sitting naked next to Ian seemed impossible.
In their room, he changed into a robe, trying to think of an excuse to skip it. A year ago, this would have paralysed him. The anxiety would have won, hands down. But now? His insecurities were still there, still whispering, but this was socially acceptable time with Ian naked. When else would this opportunity present itself? The excitement of the moment overtook every other consideration. The shame, the fear—they were irrelevant in the face of that.
He followed Ian down to the sauna complex. The facility was beautiful, with multiple rooms at different temperatures. They gathered in the changing area, everyone stripping off robes and wrapping towels around their waists for the walk to the hot room.
The sauna itself was large enough to accommodate their group comfortably. Ray had chosen the hottest one, the temperature gauge reading ninety degrees. Jay could feel the heat radiating out even before they entered.
Inside, wooden benches lined the walls in tiers. Everyone claimed spots, and then the towels came off. Jay kept his eyes straight as he removed his own towel and sat down on the second tier, trying to look like this was completely normal and not at all terrifying.
Thankfully the heat of the place hid his crimson blush well.
He stared determinedly at the ceiling. The wood was beautiful, expertly fitted. Very interesting wood. Fascinating wood, really.
From the corner of his eye, he could see Ian sitting nearby. Completely naked. Casually reclining against the wall like this was the most natural thing in the world. Ian looked relaxed, elegant, completely unbothered. Beautiful.
Jay's eyes darted over before he could stop himself. Ian's body was perfectly sculpted, lean muscle definition from years of training. The gym had done its work. He looked like he belonged in marble.
Jay snapped his eyes back to the ceiling. This was mortifying. 
This was also thrilling, making him feel guilty and excited and terrified all at once. Ian's body, completely exposed to his eyes, made his heart hammer so loudly he was certain everyone could hear it. The heat made it worse, his pulse racing, his skin flushed. This view was going to haunt his dreams for the rest of his life.
"This is exactly what we needed," Ray broke the silence.
"Agreed. I can feel my core temperature coming back," Zoe replied.
Jay focused on their voices, trying to distract himself. This was normal. People did this all the time. He wasn't dying, even though it felt like he might be.
"How hot does this get?" Rin asked.
"Up to a hundred degrees. But ninety is optimal for recovery."
The conversation continued, but Jay contributed nothing, too busy trying not to stare at Ian while also trying not to make it obvious that he was trying not to stare.
"You alright?" Ian asked at one point.
"Fine. Just hot."
"That's the point."
"Right. Yes. The point."
Jay returned his attention to the ceiling, where it would stay for the foreseeable future, and tried to remember how to breathe normally.
Scene 4
Pitiful plea
After the sauna, dinner was a natural conclusion to an exhausting day. The food was hearty and filling—roasted pheasants with root vegetables, thick gravy, more of that wonderful herbal bread.
Rin was recounting their trail adventures. "And then Ray—Ray—just stripped down and plunged straight into this wild pond. No hesitation. Just dove right in."
Luc nodded along. "I thought he was joking. He was not joking."
"He went under completely. I've never seen him look that happy," Zoe added.
Ray looked completely unperturbed by the storytelling. "Wild pools are even better than the facility ones. More minerals, less processing."
"It smelled like sulphur," Rin complained.
"That's the minerals."
"It was awful. Like rotten eggs."
Ray just shrugged and returned to his food.
Rin laughed again, clearly delighted by the entire experience. The team smiled, enjoying the unusual glimpse into Ray's passions.
Jay picked at his pheasant, only half-listening. The sauna had left him feeling strange. He kept seeing it. Ian's body, completely bare, enchanting and irresistible. The image refused to leave. Every time he closed his eyes it was there, burned into his mind. He needed to stop thinking about it.
He reached for his wine glass and drank more than he meant to. When no one was looking he found a bottle of liquor on the side table and poured a generous measure into his glass. The alcohol hit him faster than expected, the sauna apparently having destroyed what little tolerance he had. His limbs started to feel heavy.
By the middle of dinner, everything had gone blurry. Jay stared at his half-eaten pheasant and tried to remember why he'd stopped eating it. He wanted to eat more, but the fork was difficult to manage.
Ian turned to look at him. "Jay?"
"Mmm?"
"Are you alright?"
"Fiiiine."
"How much did you drink?"
"Little bit. Maybe. More than little bit."
"I think we should step outside for some air."
"'M fine."
"You're not fine. Come on."
Jay didn't answer. He was focused on his plate, trying to spear a piece of potato. Ian got up and addressed the table. "We're heading back. He needs to sleep this off."
"This is becoming a tradition," Luc observed.
"Seems like it."
Max raised his glass in a mock salute. "Good luck."
Ian helped him stand. Jay's legs worked, but only just. Everything tilted sideways. He held onto Ian's arm and concentrated on walking.
They made it to the lobby before Ian paused. "Let's get some fresh air. It might help."
He guided Jay toward the entrance, and they stepped outside into the freezing night. The cold was shocking after the warmth of the dining room. Above them, stars scattered across the sky in impossible numbers, burning fiercely against the darkness.
"Oh," Jay breathed, staring up. Then the cold registered fully and he whimpered, pressing against Ian. "Cold. It's so cold."
He clung to Ian desperately, trying to burrow into his warmth. The embrace was clumsy, but he didn't care. Ian was warm and Jay was freezing. Ian's arms came around him. For a moment they stood like that, Jay plastered against Ian's chest, shivering. Ian seemed torn, his hold uncertain, like he couldn't decide whether to push Jay away or pull him closer.
"We need to get you inside," Ian said finally. 
He steered Jay back through the lobby and down the hallway to their suite. Jay stumbled along beside him, still holding onto Ian's sleeve with both hands.
In the room, Ian tried to guide him toward the bed. "Come on. You need to sleep this off."
But Jay pulled back, refusing. He sat down on the floor instead and stayed there, looking up at Ian with unfocused eyes.
"Jay, get up."
"No."
"You can't sleep on the floor."
"Don't wanna."
Ian crouched beside him, looking concerned. "What's wrong? Tell me what I can do to help."
"Nothing. There's nothing you can do."
"That's not true. I'll do anything. Just tell me what you want."
"I want you to hold me for the rest of my life," Jay whispered.
Ian froze.
Jay looked at him through the fog of alcohol, seeing Ian's expression, and felt his heart crack. "It's okay. I know it's too much. I know. Just—just for tonight? Please? Just tonight and I won't ask again, I promise."
His vision was blurring. He might have been crying, he wasn't sure, and Ian was looking at him like Jay had said something incomprehensible.
"Please," Jay whispered. "Just tonight."
"Alright. Alright, I've got you."
Ian cursed himself as he gathered Jay into his arms, moving him to the bed. He lay down with Jay still clinging to him, arranging them both on top of the covers, Jay's head tucked against his shoulder.
"There. I'm holding you. Is this what you wanted?"
"Yeah. This is—this is amazing. Don't need anything else. Ever."
Jay made himself comfortable against Ian's body, fitting himself into the spaces between them. Ian's arms were tight around him. This was more than he'd ever dared hope for.
"This is amazing. Feels so good. Don't need anything else. Just this. Just you."
Ian's hold tightened. "Shh. Just rest."
Jay felt Ian's hand come up to stroke through his hair. The motion was soothing, hypnotic. Jay's eyes drifted closed. The alcohol and exhaustion and warmth all combined, pulling him down into sleep.
Ian held him for a long time after Jay's breathing evened out into sleep. He lay there in the dark room, arms around Jay, feeling the rise and fall of his chest. Jay had curled into him trustingly, completely relaxed now.
Hold me for the rest of my life.
The words echoed in Ian's head, playing on repeat. He knew it was just drunk rambling, likely triggered by the atmosphere, the exhaustion, the wine on top of the sauna. It didn't mean anything. Jay wouldn't even remember saying it tomorrow.
It was still the most beautiful thing Ian had ever heard.
He wanted to kiss Jay's hair. The temptation was almost painful. Just a small gesture, barely anything. But he couldn't. He had already crossed too many lines tonight, if he took more it would become something he couldn't take back.
He stayed like that for what felt like hours, savouring the weight of Jay against him, the warmth of his body, the sounds of his breathing. This moment, this closeness—it was something Ian would never forget, even knowing he shouldn't have it.
Finally, when he was certain Jay was deeply asleep, Ian extracted himself. He laid Jay down properly, wrapped him in a blanket, made sure he was comfortable and warm, then he forced himself to move away. He went to his own bed and lay down, staring at the ceiling in the darkness.
Sleep was impossible. His mind kept replaying the evening—Jay clinging to him in the cold, the desperate plea for Ian to hold him, the weight of him in Ian's arms. Rest of my life, Jay had said.
Ian closed his eyes and let himself imagine it, just for a moment. A life where Jay meant those words. Where Ian could hold him not just for one night but for all the nights to come. Where this closeness was allowed, accepted. The fantasy hurt more than it comforted.
Ian opened his eyes again, banishing the thoughts. Tomorrow Jay would wake up embarrassed, probably not remembering clearly what he'd said. They would pretend it hadn't happened. Everything would go back to normal.
In the darkness of this room with Jay sleeping peacefully nearby, Ian let himself feel the full weight of what he wanted and couldn't have, the love he'd been suppressing for so long, the hope he kept trying to suffocate.
Hold me for the rest of my life.
"I would," Ian whispered into the darkness. "God help me, I would."

Scene 5
Cruel joke
Jay woke with a faint headache and the vague sense that he had done something terrible.
He kept his eyes closed, trying to piece together the previous night through fragments of memory. Cold air. Stars burning overhead. Warmth. Ian's scent. The feel of being held.
Oh no.
Jay curled into a ball, pulling the blanket over his head. Had he clung to Ian? Had he actually done that? The memory was hazy but undeniable. He'd grabbed onto Ian outside, desperate and pathetic, seeking warmth like a child.
He groaned and pulled at his hair through the blanket. He was an imbecile. A complete and utter imbecile.
What else had he done? What had he said? The memories were frustratingly incomplete, sliding away when he tried to focus on them. Just impressions. The security of Ian's arms around him.
He needed to face this. Whatever damage he'd done, he had to make it right. He sat up slowly and opened his eyes properly. The room was bright. His bed was rumpled from restless sleep. And Ian—
Ian was already up, sitting on the balcony in the freezing weather. A coffee cup sat on the table beside him. He looked like a statue, completely still, staring out at the ocean. It felt like a very bad omen.
On the nightstand beside Jay's bed sat a glass of water and two painkillers.
He took the painkillers, drank the water, and headed to the bathroom. The shower was scalding hot, an attempt to wash away the shame and confusion. He stood under the spray, trying to organize his thoughts.
He'd overstepped badly. He'd made Ian uncomfortable, imposed on him, created a situation that Ian had been too kind to refuse. The worst part was not knowing exactly what he'd done. The gaps in his memory were full of potential disasters.
When he finally emerged from the bathroom, he found Ian exactly where he'd left him. Still on the balcony. Still frozen in place.
Jay's resolve hardened. He wanted nothing more than to hide and never show his face again, but more than anything, he needed to apologize. Ian didn't deserve to face such indignation from his own assistant. Jay would accept whatever punishment came. He'd leave if Ian wanted. He'd report himself to HR. Whatever it took to atone.
He stepped onto the freezing balcony, the cold immediately biting through his sweater. His wet hair made it worse, but he didn't let it deter him.
"Ian, I'm so sorry. I don't remember everything from last night, but I know I—"
Ian cut him off immediately. "You didn't do anything wrong."
"But I—"
"You were drunk. Floppy and mumbling, but otherwise very manageable. You cried a lot, though. Apparently you're a sad drunk."
"I cried?" Jay didn't remember crying. That was somehow more mortifying than if he'd been rowdy or ridiculous. 
"Yes. I had to lull you to sleep."
"I'm sorry."
"Don't be."
"Then why are you out here?"
"I have a strange headache. Feels more like a migraine. I thought the cold would help, but it hardly did."
"Oh. I'm still sorry. For crying. For being a burden."
"You weren't a burden. Come inside. You're going to catch pneumonia."
Back in the warmth of the room, Ian closed the balcony door and turned to face Jay directly. "Nothing happened, Jay. You were upset, I helped you to bed. That's all. You don't need to apologize."
But Jay wasn't entirely convinced. Maybe Ian was just being kind, protecting Jay from the full embarrassment of whatever he'd done.
They packed in near silence, checking the room for forgotten items, zipping up suitcases. At breakfast, fragments of the team were scattered around the tables. Zoe and Luc had apparently left early for another short hike at the cliffs. Ray was in the hot springs with Rin, taking advantage of every last moment. The rest were finishing their food.
"There he is. How's the head?" Max called out when Jay appeared.
"Fine," Jay lied.
"You were pretty far gone last night. We were taking bets on whether you'd make it to breakfast."
"The sauna must have lowered my alcohol tolerance. I barely remember the evening."
"Classic."
After breakfast, Ian suggested they get a hot stone massage. They spent an hour in the spa. Jay felt better afterwards, less panicked about the previous night.
They soaked in one of the pools afterwards, but the peace Jay had felt yesterday was missing. He kept watching Ian, searching for clues about what had really happened.
Ian kept his eyes closed, face tilted toward the sky. "Stop worrying," he said without opening them.
"I'm not—"
"You are. I promise you, everything is fine. I just have a headache. It's going to pass in a day or two."
At lunch, everyone gathered to share final stories before departure. Ray and Rin appeared from the springs. Zoe and Luc returned from their hike, windswept and happy. The flight back was loud, everyone still riding the high of the weekend. 
Ian sat with his eyes closed, headphones in. Jay watched him with worry. Ian really did look unwell. Jay wanted to ask if he was alright, but Ian had already said he was fine, and pushing would only be rude.
When they landed, everyone dispersed. Ian and Jay walked to the car in silence, and the drive back to Jay's apartment was equally quiet. When Ian pulled up outside Jay's building, Jay opened the door, then hesitated. "Ian?"
"Yes?"
"If I did anything—if I said anything that made you uncomfortable, I really am sorry."
"You didn't. I promise. I'll see you Monday."
Jay climbed out of the car, retrieved his suitcase from the trunk, and stood on the sidewalk watching as Ian drove away. The sadness in that final look stayed with him as he rode the elevator up to his apartment. Something had happened. Ian could say nothing was wrong all he wanted, but Jay knew better.
Ian drove home on autopilot. He made it to his building, to his apartment, through his door. He dropped his suitcase in the entryway and walked to his couch, sitting down heavily. Jay's words from the night before echoed endlessly in his head. 
Hold me for the rest of my life.
It would have been easier if Jay had been indifferent. Cold, even. But Jay's sweetness, his innocent adoration, the eagerness with which he'd melted into Ian's embrace—it felt like knives to his heart. An eagerness Ian was never allowed to have. A cruel joke played by fate and circumstance.
It had taken every ounce of Ian's control to sit on that freezing balcony and not show what he was feeling. To reassure Jay that nothing had happened, that everything was fine. It had taken even more control to maintain that facade through the day, to act normal when his heart felt like it was tearing itself apart.
He'd almost broken in the car. The way Jay had looked at him with those wide gray eyes, worried and apologetic—Ian had wanted to pull him back, to tell him the truth. That the night before had been the most painful experience of Ian's life. That Jay had said exactly what Ian had been desperate to hear, and that was the cruellest part of all.
He needed to pull himself together. This weakness was unacceptable. He'd weathered worse than this—betrayal, scandal, exile from his own family. He could handle impossible love. He'd been handling it just fine. He just needed time to steel his heart again. 
A day or two. That's what he'd told Jay, and he'd make it true. By Monday he'd be fine. Everything would return to normal. He was good at controlling himself. Excellent at it, even. But for now, alone in his apartment, he let himself fall apart completely.
