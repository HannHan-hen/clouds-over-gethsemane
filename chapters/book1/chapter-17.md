# Chapter 17: Retreat
## Scene 1
Arrival
The buses waited outside Northlight Financial Center at ten sharp, five pristine carriages that could have transported twice their number in comfort. Jay had risen at seven for his eight o’clock appointment at the same salon where he’d had his hair cut months earlier, having booked an early slot in advance so he wouldn’t spend the day worrying about his appearance.
The stylist remembered him, working to create something polished but not overly formal. Jay left feeling properly groomed for whatever the evening would demand, a small weight lifted from his shoulders.
He wore his new cream slacks and a short-sleeved button-down shirt, aiming for semi-business casual since his standard weekend attire consisted of sweatpants and old t-shirts with strategic holes. Around him, his colleagues had embraced the casual dress code with obvious relief. Luc appeared in jeans and a vintage band t-shirt, while Kim wore an actual tracksuit that somehow managed to look expensive.
The women had clearly spent their mornings at beauty appointments, their hair and makeup immaculate. They'd all had the same thought—get the grooming done early so the evening preparations would be simple.
Ian was the sole exception to casual Friday, wearing a summer-weight suit in pale gray that looked both elegant and seasonally appropriate. He sat down with his laptop, clearly intending to work the entire journey.
The team claimed places near the front of the first bus, everyone granted a double seat to themselves. Their luggage had been expertly loaded by staff, requiring no effort from the passengers beyond showing up on time.
Jay sat by a window, watching the city buildings give way to suburbs and then open countryside. The bus was more comfortable than any vehicle he'd ever ridden, with leather seating and climate control that made the journey feel effortless.
Amy, Ela, Max, and Luc shared stories from previous retreats. Kim remained absorbed in his phone, while Zoe dozed peacefully across the aisle. Ian's keyboard provided a soundtrack of white noise.
"The spa at last year's location was incredible. I still think about that hot stone massage," Amy said.
"Remember the golf tournament? Leo spent more time in the sand traps than on the fairway," Max added with a chuckle.
"At least he didn't fall off the yacht during the regatta. Though watching him try to sail was entertainment enough," Ela replied.
Jay was caught between listening to the office gossip and absorbing the changing landscape outside his window. He rarely traveled beyond the city limits, and the rolling hills and distant mountains felt like a revelation.
Quality snacks appeared at regular intervals, served by attentive staff who seemed to anticipate every need. Jay helped himself to things he found delicious. The entire experience felt way too fancy for a simple bus ride.
As they approached the coast, the scenery became breathtaking. Jay pressed closer to the window, watching the land flatten and the air take on a different quality. When the ocean finally appeared, vast and glittering in the afternoon sun, he forgot to participate in conversation entirely.
"Do you like the seaside?" Ian's voice came from directly behind him, quiet enough not to interrupt the others.
Jay turned, surprised by the personal question. "I love it, actually. Though I've only visited once in my life."
"The ambient noise of the waves and the salt air are delightful," Ian said.
"Very calming. The large expanse of water puts everything in perspective."
"If the city were closer to the shore, I'd probably get a yacht."
Jay laughed. "You definitely look like someone who owns a yacht."
"I'll take that as a compliment. Though I'm not sure what yacht-owning appearance entails."
The resort appeared as they crested a hill, a collection of elegant buildings nestled between manicured gardens and pristine beach. Staff waited at the entrance with welcome drinks and clipboards, orchestrating the controlled chaos of hundred-odd people disembarking simultaneously. Jay accepted a glass of a fruity and tropical cocktail, marvelling at the seamless organization. 
"Mr. Hall?" A young woman with a tablet appeared at his elbow. "You're in Seaview Suite fourteen with Mr. Hagen. Here's your keycard and welcome packet."
She handed him a leather folder containing his room key, a detailed schedule, and a map of the property. Everything was handled like a military operation.
Most of his colleagues headed directly to their accommodations to change into something more suitable for the seaside setting. Jay examined his current outfit and decided it would suffice—he had no desire to change clothes three times before dinner.
Instead, he explored the premises, impressed by the top-tier amenities. The grounds were immaculate, the architecture designed to complement the natural beauty of the coastline.
Lunch began at one-thirty on a spectacular patio overlooking the ocean. Small tables dotted the space, encouraging mingling while offering various vantage points for the view. Chefs worked at outdoor stations, preparing dishes Jay couldn't identify but found irresistible.
He claimed a table with the best ocean view and lounged there like a true country bumpkin, alternately staring at the waves and sampling tropical skewers that combined sweet and spicy flavours.
The atmosphere was so relaxed it seemed to affect everyone, even Ian, who actually joined in with the joking. The sea breeze kept the temperature comfortable despite the warm sun, and Jay enjoyed every aspects of the meal.
After lunch concluded, people dispersed to their rooms to prepare for the afternoon's activities. Jay consulted his materials, locating his room number on the provided map. When he finally found it, Ian was already there, sitting at the desk with his laptop open.
"Shouldn't this be time for rest, not work?" Jay asked, setting down his keycard.
"Don't mind me. The habit is too ingrained to change now." Ian replied without looking up.
Ian had claimed the bed closer to the window, leaving Jay the one near the bathroom. The room was comfortably spacious, with a seating area and a secluded balcony with an excellent view of the coastline.
Jay took time to explore, amazed by the quality of everything. The bathroom was enormous, every fixture speaking to the standard of the hotel. The beds looked like they could accommodate three people comfortably.
He lay down for a moment, listening to the rhythmic clicking of Ian's keyboard. The sound was soothing, reminding him if countless late evenings at the office.
"I hope you don't snore," Ian said suddenly, his tone light with attempted humour.
"Not to my knowledge. But if I do, feel free to strangle me in my sleep."
Ian's chuckle indicated the comment had achieved its intended effect. Jay unpacked, inspecting his evening outfit for wrinkles before hanging it in his designated closet. Everything looked acceptable, though he still felt under-dressed compared to what his colleagues would likely wear.
The afternoon's first event was scheduled for four o'clock—an art exhibition featuring renowned local painters displaying their works in a gallery space adjacent to the main resort. Jay left early, while Ian insisted he needed to finish whatever demanded his attention.
The team gathered in the exhibition hall, consulting their informational booklets while examining the displayed pieces. Jay knew nothing about art, so he adopted a strategy of walking slowly and appearing thoughtfully engaged.
Ian appeared eventually, moving through the space as if he was deeply knowledgeable about art. He paused before a landscape piece, studying it with obvious interest.
"That one's charming," he commented when Jay approached.
"I wouldn't know charm from disaster. My cultural education was somewhat limited."
"When in doubt, comment on the bold artistic expression. It's always safe."
They walked together for a while, with Ian commenting occasionally on the artworks. Jay drew reassurance from having Ian beside him in the intimidating environment, though he tried not to depend on him too obviously.
Eventually their paths diverged, and Jay gravitated toward Luc, who was examining a sculpture.
"Everyone looks so impressed. I have no idea what's happening," Jay said quietly.
"Neither do I. But we're doing an excellent job of pretending otherwise."
Artists in flamboyant outfits circulated through the space, explaining their work to anyone who would listen. Jay made it his mission to avoid them, while Ian moved between conversations, even purchasing some pieces.
Jay noticed small ribbons appearing on certain frames—sold pieces, he assumed, though the prices remained absent from public view. Ian's choices seemed random to Jay's untrained eye, no more notable than the works that remained available.
Jay eventually stopped before a large abstract piece, bright colours arranged in harmonious patterns that somehow pleased his eye despite his general confusion about art.
"Do you like it?" Ian asked, appearing beside him.
"If I'm being honest, this is the only one here I actually like," Jay admitted.
"I find it appealing as well. If you don't mind, I'd like to purchase it."
Jay laughed. "There's no way in hell I could afford something like this. I can only assume that this exhibition is way above my pay grade."
An attendant appeared within minutes, attaching a ribbon to the frame. The artist materialized shortly after, effusive in his gratitude and eager to discuss his inspiration with the buyer. Ian responded diplomatically while Jay tried to edge away unnoticed. But the painter caught sight of him and asked for his opinion on the piece.
"Bold choices," Jay mumbled, remembering Ian's earlier advice.
Ian's mouth twitched with suppressed amusement, but he maintained his serious expression throughout the artist's enthusiastic explanation of colour theory and emotional resonance.
As people began leaving the gallery, Jay seized his opportunity and made his escape as soon as politeness allowed. He definitely didn't belong at such events, but all things considered, it hadn't been terrible.
## Scene 2
The sunset dinner
Jay returned to their room directly from the gallery, wanting to prepare without rushing. The bathroom was spacious enough to serve as a dressing room, with mirrors that provided every possible angle. He spread his evening outfit across the marble counter, taking inventory of each piece.
The ensemble from Hathaway's Menswear looked great, suggesting expensive taste without shouting about it. Jay changed, checking his reflection from multiple angles. The clothes fit him well, transforming his plainness into sophistication. His hair still held its morning styling, and overall he looked polished without appearing to try too hard. The investment had been worth every uncomfortable penny.
When he emerged from the bathroom, Ian was already in the room, laying his own evening wear across his bed. Both men froze momentarily.
"You look..." Ian began, then stopped, his composure faltering slightly. "Very appropriate for the evening."
Jay felt warmth rise in his cheeks. "The salesman knew what he was doing."
"Clearly." Ian's response was brief, but his gaze lingered before he turned back to his preparations.
Jay sat on the plush armchair by the window, watching the sun begin its descent toward the horizon. Ian moved around the room, gathering his clothes before disappearing into the bathroom. Jay tried to focus on the ocean view, but his thoughts kept circling back to Ian's reaction.
Ten minutes later, Ian emerged wearing a perfectly tailored three-piece navy suit with a white shirt and silver tie, a folded silk pocket square sitting neatly in his breast pocket. A platinum tie pin and discreet cufflinks completed the ensemble. The cut sharpened his already commanding silhouette, and the colour set a cooler edge to the blue of his eyes.
"Ready?" Ian asked.
"Ready," Jay confirmed, though he felt anything but.
They left the room together, walking toward the elevator, both lost in their own thoughts. Jay wondered if he would embarrass himself at dinner, while Ian struggled with the fact that "appropriate" had been a woefully inadequate description of how Jay looked.
The dinner venue occupied the entire top floor, with panoramic windows showcasing the spectacular sunset. Round tables draped in cream linen bore plate settings that belonged in museums. The decor managed to be both opulent and tasteful, with fresh flowers arranged in crystalline vases and ambient lighting that made everyone appear touched by golden hour magic.
Jay was struck by how beautiful his colleagues looked in their evening wear. The casual atmosphere of the afternoon had given way to glamour that belonged in magazines. Ela wore a flowing midnight blue dress, while Amy had chosen emerald green that complemented her dark hair.
They found their assigned table near the windows, where the sea stretched endlessly beyond the glass. Jay took his seat between Luc and Amy, with Ian directly across from him.
"This is incredible," Amy said, gesturing toward the view. "Look how the light hits the water."
Foreign chefs from renowned restaurants had been brought in specifically for the evening, and each course arrived like a small work of art. Jay studied the first dish, unsure what half the ingredients were but willing to try everything. The presentation was so elaborate it seemed wrong to disturb it with his fork.
"What do you think that is?" Luc asked, pointing to a delicate purple garnish.
"Bold artistic expression," Jay replied without thinking, then caught Ian's amused look across the table.
The wine pairings were explained with each serving, and despite his caution with alcohol, Jay accepted each glass. Everything was more complex and sophisticated than anything he'd experienced before, yet somehow the unfamiliarity felt manageable with his colleagues around him.
As the evening progressed, live music began and desserts appeared that looked too beautiful to eat. The wine and cocktail bar opened in full swing, with bartenders creating drinks that sparkled and smoked. Jay accepted whatever was offered, more relaxed than usual in such a formal setting.
Turner senior gave a brief speech about company achievements and future goals, his words predictably dull but mercifully short. When he finished, the formal structure dissolved into mingling and conversation that flowed as freely as the alcohol.
Jay chatted easily with people he barely knew from other departments. The wine had mellowed his social anxiety, making conversations feel less fraught. When Jen from accounting approached, he welcomed her into the group without suspicion.
"You look wonderful tonight, Jay," she said, moving closer than necessary.
"Thanks. The salesman picked everything out for me."
"I bet you could wear anything and look good."
"I think that's giving me too much credit."
Her laugh seemed disproportionate to his comment, but Jay was too focused on the conversation around him to analyse why. 
"Your shirt really brings out your eyes," she said, moving closer.
"Bold choice by the designer," Jay replied seriously.
"I love a man who pays attention to fashion."
"The fabric quality is quite good."
Jen laughed, moving even closer. "You're funny when you're relaxed."
Luc watched this exchange with growing discomfort before finally intervening. "Jay, want to see the balcony? The view from up here is supposed to be amazing."
"Absolutely," Jay agreed readily, following Luc outside.
The balcony wrapped around the building's corner, offering an unobstructed view of the water. The sunset painted everything in shades of gold and pink, and Jay stared in wonder at the sight.
"Everyone's being super friendly tonight," he observed, swaying slightly in the evening breeze.
"That's one way to put it," Luc replied dryly.
Jay continued admiring the view, oblivious to the rescue that had just occurred. The alcohol had made everything seem pleasant and unthreatening, including attention he would normally find uncomfortable.
From inside, Ian watched through the glass doors with frustration. Leo appeared at his side, clearly entertained by the evening's developments.
"Your assistant has become quite the social butterfly."
"He's enjoying himself."
"Jen certainly thinks so. She's been circling him all evening."
Ian's grip tightened on his glass. "She's being friendly."
"That's one word for it. Though he seems completely oblivious to her intentions. Actually, he seems oblivious to most things right now."
"He doesn't drink often," Ian said, his attention fixed on Jay's animated conversation with a group from the risk management.
"Protective of him, aren't you?"
Ian ignored him completely, watching Jay's profile against the sunset. The evening light caught in Jay's dark hair and emphasized the delicate lines of his face.
When Jay returned inside, he drifted through the crowd with a dreamy smile, nodding agreeably at whoever spoke to him. His responses had devolved into variations of "bold artistic expression" regardless of the topic, which amused some people and confused others. It was the first time Ian had seen Jay truly drunk, and the change from his usual restraint was both endearing and concerning.
Ian tracked Jay's movements from across the room, monitoring his comfort level and ready to intervene if the conversation overwhelmed him. By eleven o'clock, Jay was visibly unsteady but still smiling, accepting drinks from anyone who offered them. Jen had made several more attempts to capture his attention, each more obvious than the last, but Jay responded to her flirtation with the same oblivious politeness he showed everyone. 
Ian finally approached when Jay nearly stumbled while reaching for yet another cocktail, placing a steadying hand on his elbow.
"I think it's time we called it an evening."
Jay looked up at him with glassy eyes and a docile expression. "If you think so."
The compliance was a welcome development. He guided Jay toward the exit, nodding politely at colleagues who called out goodnight wishes.
The elevator ride passed in silence, Jay leaning against the wall with his eyes half-closed. When they reached their room, Ian unlocked the door and ushered Jay inside.
"Will you be alright?" Ian asked, watching Jay sway slightly on his feet.
"Going right to sleep," Jay mumbled, already tugging his shirt over his head.
Ian caught a glimpse of pale skin and the lean lines of Jay's torso before panic seized him. He fled the room without another word, his heart hammering against his ribs as he made his way back to the elevator.
Back at the venue, Ian made his way directly to the bar and ordered something strong enough to burn away the image seared into his memory. The party continued around him, colleagues laughing and dancing, but he remained focused solely on the task of drowning his inappropriate thoughts in liquor. Shortly after midnight, worry finally overcame his need for distance.
When Ian returned to their room, alarm shot through him at the sight of Jay's empty bed. Then he noticed light spilling from beneath the bathroom door.
"Jay?" He knocked gently. "Are you alright?"
Splashing sounds were followed by Jay's voice, slightly slurred but coherent. "I'll be out in a minute."
Ten minutes later, Jay emerged in loose gray pyjamas and with damp hair. The bathroom released a cloud of floral-scented steam.
"Sorry. I wanted a bath and I think I fell asleep in there."
He dropped onto his bed with a contented sigh, pulling the covers up to his chin. Within moments his breathing had evened out into sleep, leaving Ian alone with thoughts that grew more complicated by the minute.
Ian stepped onto the balcony, retrieving the pack of cigarettes he kept for emergencies. He'd quit smoking years ago, but tonight qualified as a crisis that warranted breaking old promises to himself. The nicotine helped steady his nerves, though it did nothing to stop the yearning that seemed to grow stronger with every innocent gesture Jay made.
After finishing his cigarette, Ian returned inside and prepared for bed, moving quietly to avoid waking Jay. He lay awake long after his shower, listening to Jay's peaceful breathing and wondering how much longer he could maintain the charade.
## Scene 3
Pool party
Jay woke to a pounding headache that felt like someone was using his skull as a drum. He groaned and pressed his palms against his temples, trying to block out the morning light filtering through the curtains.
"There's water and painkillers on the bedside table," Ian's voice came from across the room.
Jay shuffled around blindly until his fingers found the glass and pills. The water was blissfully cold against his parched throat, and he drained half of the glass before collapsing back onto his pillow.
"What time is it?" he mumbled.
"Seven. You can take it slow—breakfast runs until eleven."
Jay forced himself into a sitting position and saw Ian propped up in his own bed, laptop balanced on his knees. He wore silk pyjamas in silver, looking elegant even first thing in the morning. The sight made Jay acutely aware of his own rumpled state.
He finished the glass of water and groaned again. "I can't remember how I got back here."
"I helped you to the room when you looked like you'd had enough," Ian replied without looking up from his screen.
Heat flooded Jay's cheeks. "God, I'm sorry. I hope I didn't make a scene."
"You didn't. These events are specifically designed for employees to get drunk and blow off steam. You have nothing to apologize for. Did you have fun?"
"I did. The evening was lovely, though I wish I hadn't drunk quite so much."
"Good wine can sneak up on you."
Jay rubbed his forehead. "Thanks for looking out for me."
"Would you like coffee?" Ian asked, closing his laptop.
"You don't need to tend to me."
"I want coffee myself. I would have made it earlier, but I didn't want to wake you."
Jay nodded, and Ian rose from bed to operate the coffee machine tucked into the room's small kitchenette. Jay was surprised such equipment existed in hotel rooms, but then again, this wasn't exactly a typical hotel.
The rich smell of brewing coffee gradually filled the space. Ian returned with two steaming cups, handing one to Jay before sitting back on his bed with his laptop.
"Do you always work?" Jay asked, cradling the warm mug.
"Not always, but often enough. A company retreat feels like the perfect environment for uninterrupted productivity."
Jay dropped back onto his pillow and whimpered pitifully. His head still felt like it was splitting open, and his stomach churned with every movement. The painkillers couldn't start working fast enough.
They sat in silence for a while, Ian typing while Jay focused on not dying. The coffee helped marginally, warming his throat and providing something to concentrate on besides his misery.
"You talk in your sleep," Ian said suddenly.
Jay's eyes snapped open. "That's impossible."
"Who's Rus?"
Jay felt his face burn with mortification. "He's my gym trainer."
Ian looked surprised. "You go to the gym?"
"Sporadically. Just to stay in minimal shape."
"You were whimpering as if Rus was causing you great distress."
"He might as well be. The rowing machine leaves me crying."
Ian's mouth quirked upward slightly before he returned to his work. They lapsed back into silence, Jay slowly sipping his coffee and willing himself to feel human again.
Eventually the painkillers began to take effect, dulling the worst of his headache. He managed to drag himself to the bathroom for a cold shower, letting the water shock some life back into his system.
When he emerged, dressed in fresh cream slacks and a light green shirt with rolled sleeves, he felt marginally more like a functioning person. Still wobbly and slightly nauseous, but no longer actively dying.
"You'll feel better once you eat breakfast," Ian observed.
Jay weighed the prospect with uncertainty. "I'm not sure I'm quite ready to tackle the world outside."
"Sit on the balcony for a bit. Fresh air will help."
Jay followed the suggestion, stepping onto the small balcony and breathing deeply. The view was spectacular in the morning light, waves catching the sun like scattered diamonds. The salt breeze did help clear his head, though his stomach remained unconvinced about the wisdom of existing.
When he returned inside, Ian was dressed in his usual impeccable style—a lightweight suit that looked both elegant and appropriate for the seaside setting. Jay wondered if Ian owned anything that didn't fit perfectly.
"Ready?" Ian asked, adjusting his tie.
"As I'll ever be."
They made their way to the breakfast restaurant, which offered an impressive array of fresh options spread across multiple stations. Jay filled his plate with whatever looked appealing and was unlikely to make him sick, while Ian selected mostly vegetables and fish.
They claimed a table with a clear view of the sea, and other guests moved at the leisurely pace of people recovering from the previous evening's festivities. Jay discovered that food did indeed help—after working through his selections and another cup of coffee, the worst of his hangover began to retreat.
The rest of their team trickled in gradually, looking various degrees of worse for wear. Amy appeared with sunglasses despite being indoors, while Luc moved slowly, trying not to disturb his own head.
"At least this time Jay didn't hide in the bathroom," Max said with a grin as he joined their table.
"I was perfectly social," Jay protested mildly.
"You were chatting with everyone. Very unlike your usual wallflower routine," Ela added, holding coffee and a plate with exclusively fruit.
The teasing was good-natured. They lingered over breakfast, no one eager to move faster than absolutely necessary.
Eventually someone reminded everyone that the pool party was scheduled to begin at eleven, which prompted a gradual exodus back to rooms for swimwear changes.
Jay and Ian returned to their shared space, where the prospect of changing clothes created a new source of anxiety for Jay. His new swim trunks were supposed to be appropriate for a resort, but he still felt self-conscious, imagining everyone else would be dressed in designer beachwear.
When Ian emerged from the bathroom in shorts that emphasized his athletic build, Jay felt his self-consciousness spike dramatically. Ian's physique was exactly what Jay had suspected—broad shoulders, defined muscles, and proportional perfection that came from dedicated fitness routines. His skin had a light tan that hinted at regular outdoor activity, and everything about him screamed peak physical condition.
Jay felt like a pale, soft slug by comparison, but Ian offered no commentary as they gathered towels and headed to the pool area.
The resort's pool was enormous, with multiple sections for different activities. Some colleagues were already splashing around with pool balls, while others floated lazily on inflatable devices, clearly still recovering from the previous evening.
Jay found a quiet corner where he could wade around without calling attention to himself. Ian headed directly to the lap lanes and began swimming with a beautiful stroke that indicated serious training.
"Of course he's doing actual exercise," Luc said, appearing beside Jay with a shake of his head. "Either working or working out, just like we said."
Jay watched Ian cut through the water with powerful movements. Even at a company retreat designed for relaxation, Ian couldn't resist optimizing his time.
"Some people never turn off," Jay observed.
## Scene 4
Scuba diving
After the pool party ended, lunch was served on the seafront terrace—light fare designed for people planning to spend the afternoon underwater. Jay selected grilled fish, his appetite finally returning to normal. The hangover had mostly ended, leaving him with anticipation for the day's main event.
The scuba diving excursion had been the retreat's centrepiece since the planning stages. Jay had signed up despite his limited swimming ability, drawn by the novelty and the promise that extensive instruction would be provided. Now, watching the sleek diving boats being prepared at the resort's private dock, his excitement mixed with nervousness.
"First time diving?" asked one of the instructors as she checked equipment lists.
"First time doing anything more adventurous than a public swimming pool," Jay admitted.
She smiled reassuringly. "You'll love it. The conditions here are perfect—calm water, excellent visibility, and marine life that's used to divers."
Most groups were divided by skill level, but at Ian’s request, Jay was placed with him and the others to make sure he felt comfortable. Both Ian and Zoe could offer guidance—Ian and Luc had extensive training, and Zoe, who actually held an instructor certification, seemed excited to get back underwater.
"You'll be fine," Zoe told Jay as they boarded their designated boat. "The hardest part is remembering to breathe normally. Everything else is just floating around and looking at pretty fish."
"I had no idea you were certified," Jay said.
"There's a lot we don't know about each other. I've been diving since college. It's the closest thing to flying I've ever experienced."
The boat ride took them to a protected cove where the water was crystal clear and teeming with colourful marine life. Glass-bottom boats hosted the non-divers, offering views of the underwater world from above along with cocktails and music. Jay almost envied their safer option as he struggled into his wetsuit.
Ian appeared beside him, already fully equipped and looking completely at ease. "Need help with anything?"
Jay fumbled with his mask straps. "I'm starting to think this was overly ambitious."
Ian adjusted the straps. "The equipment does most of the work. You just have to trust it."
The instructor gathered their small group for final instructions, covering hand signals and emergency procedures that made Jay's stomach flutter with anxiety. When they finally entered the water for practice runs, Jay's natural clumsiness seemed magnified by the unfamiliar gear.
"Breathe slowly and deeply," Ian said, his voice muffled but calm through the underwater communication system. "Don't fight the water."
Jay tried to follow the advice, though his instinct was to panic at the strange sensation of breathing through the regulator. Ian stayed close, occasionally reaching out to steady him when his buoyancy control faltered.
Once they descended to the reef proper, Jay forgot his nervousness entirely. The underwater landscape was unlike anything he'd imagined—coral formations in impossible colours, schools of tropical fish that moved like living rainbows, and a sense of weightless peace that made the surface world feel distant and unimportant.
He watched Ian almost as much as the marine life. Ian moved through the water with the same grace he brought to everything else, pointing out interesting creatures and staying within arm's reach without making it obvious he was monitoring Jay's comfort.
Zoe lived up to her reputation, swimming circles around them in fluid movements, completely at home underwater. She guided them toward a small cave where larger fish sheltered in the shadows, her enthusiasm infectious even through diving masks and regulators. When they finally surfaced, Jay felt exhilarated.
"That was incredible. I can't believe I've never done this before."
"The reef here is spectacular. Most diving locations don't offer this variety of marine life," Ian replied, helping him climb back aboard.
Back on the boat, Jay watched the underwater world through the glass bottom while the others prepared for a second dive. The peaceful rhythm of fish movements and swaying coral was hypnotic, and he understood why people became obsessed with the sport.
By late afternoon, everyone had returned to shore with stories of underwater encounters and waterproof camera shots to share. Jay felt proud of conquering something that had seemed impossible that morning, and deeply aware of how much Ian’s patient guidance had helped him through the experience.
The evening's bonfire dinner took place directly on the beach, with multiple fire pits creating warm circles of light against the darkening sky. Tables groaned under the weight of grilled seafood, roasted vegetables, and tropical fruits, while staff tended enormous bonfires that sent sparks dancing toward the stars.
Jay claimed a spot near one of the fires, mesmerized by the flames dancing against the darkening sky. Colleagues wandered between different activity stations—some playing beach volleyball, others wading in the gentle surf, and a few constructing elaborate sand sculptures.
Jay filled his plate with grilled fish and roasted potatoes, avoiding alcohol entirely. His stomach still rebelled at the thought of wine or cocktails, earning him sympathetic looks from colleagues.
"There's a sandcastle competition with actual prizes," Luc announced, dropping onto a nearby lounger. "Want to team up and embarrass ourselves publicly?"
"What kind of prizes?" Jay asked, intrigued despite his complete lack of sand-building experience.
"Spa treatments, wine selections."
Max overheard and decided to join their team, though his enthusiasm exceeded his architectural ability. Their construction efforts quickly devolved into a sad pile of sand with a few shells pressed into strategic locations.
"We're definitely not winning anything," Jay observed, watching a neighbouring team create an actual castle.
"The effort counts," Max replied cheerfully, adding another shell to their crumbling walls.
Their creation was indeed pitiful compared to the intricate fortresses taking shape around them, but Jay found the collaborative failure enjoyable. They abandoned the project in favour of food when their tower collapsed for the third time. The grilled seafood was exceptional. Jay worked through several varieties of fish while watching his colleagues gathering around fires for conversation.
As the evening progressed, Ian spent time with various senior partners and executives, conducting networking that seemed to happen automatically at company events. Jay was content to lounge by the fire, watching waves crash against the shore and listening to his teammates share stories.
Near the end of the evening, Ian came to Jay's fireside spot, sitting on an adjacent chair with a glass of whiskey. The alcohol had mellowed his rigidity slightly, though he maintained perfect posture even while relaxed. They sat watching flames dance and listening to the rhythmic sound of waves. Jay felt more content than he could remember being, the day's adventures leaving him peaceful.
Ian ate grilled vegetables observing the chaos. The firelight softened his angular features, and Jay watched Ian's profile when he thought it wouldn't be noticed.
"This has been an excellent day," Jay said eventually.
"You did well for a first-timer. Most people panic during their initial dive."
"Thanks for keeping me from drowning or floating to the surface accidentally."
"The equipment prevents most dramatic failures. Though staying calm underwater does require practice."
When the night fell for good, they walked back to their room together along the moonlit beach path. Ian moved slowly, though his control remained impressively intact.
"Bathroom's yours first," Jay offered once they were inside.
Ian nodded and disappeared while Jay stepped onto the balcony to watch the sea. The sound of running water was relaxing, and when Ian emerged twenty minutes later wearing only a bathrobe, Jay felt momentarily unbalanced by the domesticity of the scene.
The bathrobe was long and properly tied, but Ian's damp hair and casual posture made Jay acutely aware they were sharing sleeping quarters like an old married couple.
"Your turn," Ian said, sitting on his bed with a tablet.
Jay intended only to shower, but the enormous bathtub looked too inviting to resist. He filled it with hot water and bath products, letting the rich scents and silken water pamper him. The scents of lavender and lily filled the steamy air, and Jay lost track of time entirely.
When he finally emerged an hour later, Ian was propped against his pillows in silver silk pyjamas, reading news on his tablet.
"Even when you're drunk, you can't rest properly."
"Old habits," Ian replied without looking up.
The day's shared experiences had created an unusual sense of closeness, and Jay felt emboldened to step outside the safe topics they usually stuck to. "What do you even do for fun?"
"Nothing, really. Everything I do serves a purpose."
The honest answer was somehow both expected and sad. Jay got into his bed and pulled the covers up to his chest.
"What about you?" Ian asked, turning the question back.
"I read. Walk around parks. Sit in cafes."
Ian's mouth curved slightly. "That sounds almost as lonely as my own choice of free time activities."
Jay laughed softly. "Solitude is comfortable."
"On that, we both agree."
Jay knew fragments of Ian's history—the family ostracism, the betrayal that had shaped his isolation. He understood they'd both experienced things that had turned them into the guarded people they'd become.
The sense of connection felt deeper than proximity or shared circumstances, though Jay reminded himself it might be an illusion created by too much excitement.
Ian felt the same pull, the same recognition of similar wounds and defences. The urge to reach across the space between their beds was almost overwhelming, but he remained still, tablet balanced on his knees like armour against impulses he couldn't allow himself to acknowledge.
They eventually turned off the lights, listening to waves crash against the shore outside their window, each man acutely aware of the other.
## Scene 5
Finale
Jay woke up before seven to find Ian already awake, propped against his pillows with a tablet in his hands.
"Morning," Jay whispered groggily.
"Good morning. Did you sleep well?"
Jay stretched and sat up. "Much better than yesterday. Let me make coffee this time. Fair's fair."
Ian accepted graciously and Jay headed to the kitchenette. Despite the early hour, neither seemed inclined to sleep longer.
They sat back on their respective beds with steaming mugs. Ian returned to his reading while Jay sprawled on his stomach, checking his phone and swinging his feet in the air. Jay had expected to feel self-conscious sharing space with Ian, but the opposite had happened. Ian didn't make him feel watched, but safe.
Ian stole glances over his tablet. Jay looked like a carefree teenager, unburdened by the weight he usually bore. These glimpses of spontaneity felt precious.
They eventually dressed and packed at a languid pace, neither eager to rush their final morning. Jay chose slightly more casual clothes—summer-weight slacks and a polo shirt. Ian maintained his usual standard with another perfectly tailored suit, though this one was lighter in both colour and fabric.
Only now did Jay notice that Ian's luggage was easily twice the size of his own single bag, which made sense given the variety of outfits Ian had produced over the weekend. Where Jay had brought selected basics, Ian clearly traveled with options for every conceivable situation.
Breakfast with the team was bittersweet, everyone aware the retreat was ending. The final day offered leisurely activities—massages, garden tours, art classes with Friday's featured artists, and various resort amenities.
Jay chose a massage straight from breakfast, his first ever spa treatment. The experience was revelatory, leaving him relaxed to a degree he hadn’t known was possible. He emerged feeling like he was floating, every muscle loose and warm.
He'd sat on the patio with an activities leaflet when Luc appeared, slightly frantic.
"We absolutely must do the treasure hunt. The prizes are incredible—tickets to an exclusive arthouse concert that are normally impossible to get. But we need four-person teams and we're running out of time."
Jay looked up from his pamphlet. "What kind of treasure hunt?"
"Problem-solving, riddles, physical challenges. Kim, Ela, Amy, and Zoe already registered as a team, and I can't find Max anywhere. We need two more people."
They eventually located Max by the pool, and after considerable persuasion, he agreed to participate. But Max had conditions.
"If we're doing this competitively, we need Ian," Max declared. "There are teams from other departments, and we can't let them show us up."
Finding Ian was easier than convincing him. "It's hardly appropriate for a CFO to take a spot in such an event," Ian protested when they cornered him.
"It's team building. We have to show these youngsters who runs things," Max insisted. 
Ian's resistance crumbled under Max's enthusiasm, and soon they were gathered at the starting line with seven other teams. Each group received a sealed packet of instructions, and they had exactly one hour to complete the course.
Jay had never participated in anything similar and felt immediately out of his depth. Max seemed equally confused by the cryptic clues, but Ian's demeanor sharpened the moment he opened their packet.
"This isn't my first team-building exercise," Ian explained, already deciphering the first riddle.
Luc was practically vibrating with excitement. "What do we do first?"
Ian solved the opening puzzle before the rest of them had finished reading it, then moved seamlessly to the next challenge. His capabilities was breathtaking—he absorbed each clue, processed the logic, and produced solutions almost instantly.
"Should we give the rest of you a chance to solve these?" Ian asked after handling three riddles in rapid succession.
"Absolutely not," Luc replied firmly. "We have to win this."
Jay followed Ian's lead like a devoted sidekick, impressed by skills he'd never suspected Ian possessed. When physical challenges required teamwork, Ian coordinated their efforts, his own conditioning compensating for Max's middle-aged limitations and Jay's mediocre fitness. Luc was surprisingly athletic, helping them complete tasks that demanded strength and agility.
They finished in record time, watching other teams struggle with puzzles Ian had solved in minutes. Amy's team came in fourth, stalled on a particularly complex challenge that required both mental and physical coordination.
"Unbelievable," Kim muttered when the results were announced, clutching his consolation prize of assorted chocolates and spa products. "Of course Ian turns out to be some kind of puzzle savant." 
Luc grinned shamelessly. "Pure skill and superior strategy."
The farewell lunch had a wistful atmosphere, everyone slightly melancholy about returning to normal life. Jay spent the remaining time on the beach, eventually joining Luc in the sea to splash around in the warm water.
When departure time arrived, they received gift bags of resort merchandise and packed containers of tropical food for the journey home. Jay's hair was still damp from his final swim, and he looked more youthful than Ian could remember seeing him—no tense shoulders, no carefully maintained polite expression, just comfortable contentment.
The bus ride back was quiet and lazy, everyone reclining in their seats and eating occasionally from the scattered containers. Even Ian abandoned his laptop, choosing instead to watch the landscape roll past his window.
Jay felt tired but deeply satisfied. He'd experienced more new things in three days than in months of regular life, and all of them had been first-class. More importantly, he'd seen different sides of his colleagues, particularly Ian, who'd revealed himself to be less tightly wound than Jay had imagined, almost relaxed at times. 
Jay dozed fitfully, waking to find they were entering familiar territory. The sight of downtown buildings created a feeling of homecoming, as if he were returning from a much longer journey than a few days. 
When they finally arrived at Northlight Financial Center, the contrast with their departure was stark. Instead of excited chatter and anticipation, people moved sluggishly, eager to reach their own beds. Luggage was retrieved with minimal fanfare, and goodbyes were exchanged with promises to share photos and plan future adventures. Jay waited for his suitcase, surprised by how reluctant he felt to leave the group. The retreat had created bonds that felt meaningful, and he wondered how those connections would translate back to the office environment. 
"Need a ride?" Ian asked.
"The metro's fine. I'm probably going in the opposite direction anyway." 
Ian hesitated, and Jay thought he might insist, but instead he simply nodded. 
"See you Monday, then." 
"See you Monday." 
Jay watched Ian disappear into the executive parking level before making his way to the metro station.  
Back in his apartment that evening, Jay unpacked immediately, doing laundry and returning items to their proper places. The routine was grounding after so much novelty. The studio felt smaller than he remembered, and somehow shabbier despite being exactly as he'd left it.  
He marveled at how comfortable and unthreatening the retreat had been. Even his hangover had been bearable thanks to Ian's unobtrusive care. The whole weekend had felt like a gift, leaving him energized.
In a burst of optimism, Jay made a decision that surprised him. He would attend his half-sister's graduation after all. Tomorrow he'd ask Ian for the day off, confident now that such a request wouldn't be viewed as presumptuous.
Meanwhile, Ian stood in his penthouse living room, studying the wall where he'd cleared space for the painting from Friday's exhibition. The piece Jay had admired would be delivered within days, though it didn't quite match his existing decor.
He chastised himself for the sentimental gesture even as he finalized the arrangement. It was a small concession, surely harmless in the long run. The painting would serve as a pleasant reminder of a successful company retreat, nothing more.
But as Ian prepared for bed, he found it increasingly difficult to silence the longing that had grown stronger with each passing day. The distance he'd maintained felt more precarious than ever.
