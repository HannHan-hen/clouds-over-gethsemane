# Chapter 10: The high finance

## Scene 1: The Grand Gala

The night of the gala arrived with unseasonable warmth for January. Jay spent an hour preparing, adjusting his bow tie multiple times. The salon had worked wonders with his hair.

Still, staring at his reflection, Jay felt ridiculous. The formal wear was perfect, but he couldn't shake the sensation of playing dress-up.

The Grand Hotel's entrance was ablaze with lights, red carpet extending from the street. Photographers flanked the walkway. Jay felt intimidated.

Inside, the ballroom was breathtaking. Crystal chandeliers cast warm light over hundreds of guests in formal attire.

Jay searched for familiar faces. The scale was staggering—at least three times larger than previous events.

"Jay!" Luc's voice cut through the noise. "Over here!"

Jay made his way through the crowd, relieved.

"You look fantastic," Luc said. "The tuxedo suits you perfectly."

"Thank you," Jay said, tugging at his cuffs. "I feel like a penguin."

Jay tried to follow this advice, but the grandeur made it difficult. Across the room, Ian stood with distinguished-looking men, radiating confidence.

Their eyes met briefly, and Jay felt a flutter in his stomach. Ian was momentarily speechless at how stunning Jay looked.

"Earth to Ian," Leo's voice cut through his thoughts. "You're staring."

Ian turned to find his friend watching with amusement.

"I wasn't staring," Ian said coolly.

"Right. One guest in particular." Leo spotted Jay. "Oh, he does look good. Someone's going to make a move."

Ian felt something twist in his stomach. "That's not my concern."

"Isn't it? You should probably go protect your poor assistant."

Ian glanced back toward Jay. The young man was handling himself well, but tension showed in his shoulders.

"He can take care of himself."

"But wouldn't it be terrible if some smooth-talking investment banker decided to show him around?"

Ian's jaw tightened. Leo gestured toward different groups eyeing Jay.

"Stop talking."

Leo laughed. "You're jealous. This is wonderful."

Across the room, Jay was being approached by a silver-haired man—a partner from a competing firm.

"Fine," Ian said abruptly. "I'll go ensure he's comfortable."

Ian straightened his shoulders and moved across the room.

"Excuse me," Ian said, appearing beside Jay. "I hope you're both enjoying the evening."

"Ian," Jay said, relief evident. "Yes, it's magnificent."

Without waiting, Ian guided Jay and Luc toward the buffet area.

"Thank goodness," Jay murmured. "I had no idea what to say to him."

They reached the buffet where Max and Amy were stationed.

Ian remained with the group instead of mingling as he typically would. Usually, these events were strategic opportunities. Tonight, he felt more interested in ensuring his team's comfort.

"This is unprecedented," Leo said, appearing with delighted surprise. "Ian Hagen holding court with his own staff."

"The evening is young," Ian replied, though he made no move to leave.

Jay stood slightly behind Ian, unconsciously using him as a shield. Ian's presence created a pocket of calm.

## Scene 2: The incident

Ian was inevitably drawn into conversations with key clients. Jay watched him move through the crowd, commanding attention.

"Come on," Max said, appearing at Jay's elbow. "Let me introduce you to some people."

Before Jay could protest, he got swept into a group. Max made enthusiastic introductions.

The conversations moved from one introduction to the next. Jay tried to keep up.

"Here, you need a drink," said a man, pressing champagne into Jay's hand.

Jay accepted, taking small sips. Another guest immediately brought another when he finished. The alcohol helped ease his nerves.

"You're much younger than I expected," commented a woman with pearls.

Jay wasn't sure how to respond, so he smiled and took another sip. The room felt warmer now.

"Such a refreshing change," another client commented, watching Jay with uncomfortable intensity. "You have a gentler disposition."

Jay managed a polite smile, though the man's tone made him uneasy.

"Absolutely charming," the client continued, moving closer. "You remind me of someone I used to know."

The man's hand landed on Jay's shoulder. Jay stepped back, but the circle made retreat impossible.

"Such pretty eyes," the client continued intimately. "I bet you get a lot of attention."

Jay's chest tightened. The man's hand moved to his back, fingers trailing along his spine. The touch felt predatory.

"You're very young, aren't you?" the client asked, breath warm against Jay's ear.

Jay tried to respond, but his voice caught. The man's hand moved to his waist, thumb stroking the fabric.

"I should—" Jay began.

"No need to be shy, beautiful. In this business, connections matter. A young man like you could benefit from the right kind of guidance."

The implications hung heavy. Jay felt humiliated and powerless.

"I should probably find my colleagues."

"Oh, don't rush off. Perhaps we could discuss opportunities privately sometime."

"I appreciate the offer, but I'm very happy in my current position."

"Are you? Such loyalty is rare." The man's other hand touched Jay's arm. "I wonder if Ian fully appreciates what he has."

Jay could feel tears welling up. It all felt horribly familiar.

"Excuse me," Jay whispered, pulling away. "I need to use the restroom."

He fled, weaving through the crowd. His hands shook as he pushed through the bathroom door, relieved to find it empty.

Jay stared at his reflection, trying to compose himself. He splashed cold water on his face.

Shame washed over him—the same helpless feeling from his first job.

Jay locked himself in a stall, trying to control his breathing. When he finally emerged, he nearly collided with Ian in the hallway.

"There you are. I've been looking for you."

Jay opened his mouth to speak, but Ian's expression stopped him. He looked furious.

"I'm sorry," Jay said quickly. "I didn't mean to disappear."

Ian's expression immediately softened. "You have nothing to apologize for. Are you alright?"

"Yes, I'm fine. Just needed some air."

Ian looked at Jay's red-rimmed eyes, trembling hands. "No, you're not fine. What happened?"

"Nothing happened. Really, I'm just tired."

"Jay. You don't have to tell me anything, but please don't pretend you're fine when you're obviously not."

"I'm sorry. I'm probably overreacting."

"Did someone upset you?"

"It was probably nothing. Just a misunderstanding."

Ian's expression darkened. "Would you like to leave? I can have my driver take you home."

"That's not necessary."

"I insist. And I'll come with you, if you don't mind. Someone here has thoroughly irritated me tonight."

Jay looked surprised. "You want to leave too?"

"Desperately. I was one inappropriate comment away from punching someone." Ian's slight smile took the edge off. "You'd actually be doing me a favor."

The admission made Jay feel less pathetic. "If you're sure."

"None at all. Let me call my driver."

Without drawing attention, Ian guided Jay through a staff door, where a black car stood ready.

## Scene 3: Soothing the fears

The car's interior was luxurious but not ostentatious. Jay sank into the cushions, finally allowing himself to relax.

"You know," Ian said as they pulled into traffic, "I once attended a similar event where a client spent the evening trying to convince me to invest in his nephew's cryptocurrency venture for pet grooming."

Jay looked at him in surprise. "Really?"

"Completely serious. He cornered me for forty minutes. I finally escaped by claiming I was allergic to shellfish."

Despite everything, Jay smiled. "Did it work?"

"Beautifully. Though I had to avoid the seafood station, which was unfortunate because they had excellent crab cakes."

Ian continued with similar stories, gradually dissolving the tension in Jay's shoulders.

"Here we are," Ian said as the car stopped.

Jay looked at the modest apartment complex. "Thank you for the ride. And for... everything."

"It was my pleasure. I hope you feel better tomorrow."

Jay hesitated. "Would you like to come up for tea?"

Ian paused. "If you're sure it wouldn't be too much trouble."

"No trouble at all."

Jay led the way through the building to the stairwell. "I'm sorry there's no elevator. It's four flights up."

"I don't mind stairs," Ian said, following without complaint.

"This is it," Jay said, unlocking his door. "It's not much, but it's home."

Ian entered, taking in the simple furniture. "It's very comfortable. You've made it welcoming."

Jay busied himself in the kitchen. "I hope you don't mind basic tea."

"Basic tea sounds perfect."

Ian sat on the small couch. When Jay brought the tea, Ian accepted it with grace.

"How long have you lived here?" Ian asked.

"About six years. I found it right after I moved to the city." Jay curled up in the armchair. "It's not glamorous, but the rent is reasonable."

"Comfort matters more than luxury. Was having a place to yourself important?"

"Yes. I value the privacy. My previous financial situation didn't really allow for anything better."

"Privacy is worth the premium."

"Exactly. I could probably afford something closer now, but I'm used to this area. It feels like home."

"That's more valuable than square footage."

"I actually enjoy the metro ride. Though I suppose you don't use public transport much."

"More than you might think. Sometimes it's faster than traffic."

They continued talking, the conversation flowing naturally. Ian's stories and warmth gradually helped Jay process the evening's distress.

When Ian finally prepared to leave, he paused. "Jay, if anyone makes you uncomfortable at future events, please don't hesitate to find me immediately."

Jay nodded, touched. "I will. Thank you."

After Ian left, Jay sat processing the evening. Ian's kindness had turned what could have been traumatic into something manageable. He'd seen a different side of Ian—warmer, even playful.

Meanwhile, Ian sat in his car outside, wrestling with his thoughts. He'd overstepped, but seeing Jay distressed had overridden every consideration. The fury he'd felt still simmered.

He'd handled it appropriately—helped a colleague. The fact that Jay looked beautiful, that his vulnerability stirred protectiveness—none of that mattered.

Ian finally instructed his driver to take him home, but Jay's smile lingered long after.

## Scene 4: Aftermath

Jay arrived at the office early Monday morning. It felt comforting after the weekend's upheaval.

Ian walked in at five minutes to eight.

"Good morning, Ian. Your nine o'clock has been moved to nine-thirty."

"Thank you, Jay. I trust you had a pleasant weekend?"

"Yes, very restful. I hope yours was as well."

"It was. Thank you for asking."

The exchange was perfectly normal. Jay felt both relief and odd disappointment. Ian's composed demeanor made clear nothing was different.

As the morning progressed, the office filled with people discussing the gala. Jay overheard fragments everywhere—praise for the venue, speculation about deals.

"Did you see Pat's dress?" Ela was saying. "That emerald was stunning."

"The food was incredible," Max added.

"The real mystery is why Ian left so early," Ela said.

Jay concentrated on his screen, hoping his face wouldn't betray anything. Clearly Ian had been discreet.

Kim appeared at Jay's desk. "How did you survive your first major gala?"

"I drank too much," Jay said. "Spent half the evening in the bathroom."

The admission prompted laughter from nearby colleagues.

"We've all been there," Luc said.

Jay listened to stories of spectacular mishaps, feeling relieved. His embarrassment seemed minor by comparison.

Throughout the morning, Ian acted as if nothing had happened. Jay thought about how normal everything felt. The weekend's turmoil might have been a dream, except for the lingering warmth from Ian's kindness.

In his office, Ian made several discrete phone calls. By evening, he'd confirmed Cruver's identity and begun researching his business relationships.

He would ensure Cruver paid for his behaviour. The plan would take time, but Cruver would learn that some actions had consequences.

As Jay prepared to leave, Ian watched him organize his desk. He couldn't forget the terror in Jay's eyes.

Jay deserved to work free from predatory behaviour. Ian would make sure that happened.

## Scene 5: Choice

January turned into February with relentless pace. The office was overwhelmed with reports. Jay managed Ian's increasingly complex schedule.

"Jay," Ian said one morning, "could you schedule a performance review? It's been six months."

Jay looked up, surprised. "Of course. When would be convenient?"

"Tomorrow afternoon. Two o'clock."

The next afternoon, Jay knocked on Ian's door, holding a notepad.

"Please, sit," Ian said. "I want to discuss your progress."

Jay sat, trying to read Ian's mood.

"First, I want to acknowledge that you've exceeded expectations. Your organizational skills have been exemplary."

Jay felt warmth spread through his chest. "Thank you."

"You've been intuitive. That's rare. Which brings me to my main point. I believe you're ready for advancement. I'd like to offer you a position as a regular team member."

Jay was stunned. "A promotion?"

"Yes. You'd be working on analysis projects. It's natural progression."

Jay's mind raced. A promotion meant recognition, everything he'd dreamed of. But it also meant leaving his current role, no longer working directly for Ian.

"I... I don't know what to say."

"You don't need to decide immediately. But I wanted you to know the opportunity exists."

"But I don't have credentials like Luc did."

"Credentials matter less than performance. And yours has been exceptional. You seem hesitant. May I ask why?"

Jay struggled. "I'm not sure I'm ready. I enjoy my current work."

His real reasons were more complicated. Jay wanted to continue working directly for Ian.

Ian watched Jay's struggle. Privately, he was overjoyed by Jay's hesitation. Working with Jay had become one of the most enjoyable aspects of his life.

But Ian's integrity overrode his preferences. "I understand your caution, but I'd encourage you to consider it. Career advancement is important."

Jay's discomfort was evident. "Could I think about it?"

"Of course. Take all the time you need. If you decide you prefer your current role, I'll be happy to retain your services. You're invaluable."

Jay felt relief. "Thank you. I appreciate the offer."

"Consider it carefully. But know that either choice will be respected."

By the end of the week, word had spread. Everyone congratulated him, but found his hesitation puzzling.

That evening, Jay sat in his apartment, weighing options. The logical choice was obvious—accept promotion, advance career. But his heart pulled differently.

He thought about Ian, about being the person Ian turned to. The role gave him purpose beyond career advancement.

More than that, he'd observed Ian's isolation. Ian shouldered tremendous responsibility with minimal support. Jay wanted to be that support.

Monday morning, Jay knocked on Ian's door. "I've made my decision."

Ian looked up. "And?"

"I'd like to stay in my current role, if that's acceptable."

"May I ask why?"

Jay had prepared. "I enjoy the work. I feel like I'm still learning."

It wasn't complete truth, but wasn't a lie. Ian watched him silently.

"I respect that decision. But the opportunity will remain open."

"Thank you. I appreciate that."

As Jay returned to his desk, he felt rightness about his choice. It might not be ambitious, but it felt authentic.

Ian watched Jay leave, fighting to suppress relief. Having Jay continue as his assistant was selfish, but made his workdays immeasurably better.

For Jay, the decision marked another milestone. His skills had been acknowledged, he'd been offered advancement, and he'd made a choice based on his values. It felt like growth, even if it meant staying in the same role.
