# Chapter 11: February rush

## Scene 1: Snow and scent

February began with a big drop in temperature and a massive snowfall that blanketed the city. Jay watched from his apartment window as the flakes continued to fall, thick and relentless, coating everything in pristine white.

His prediction about the commute was correct. The metro crawled through the tunnels at half speed. Jay fidgeted impatiently, checking his phone repeatedly. He normally arrived by seven-thirty. Today he wouldn't make it until ten minutes before eight.

The Northlight Financial Center emerged from the snow like a gleaming beacon. Jay hurried through the lobby, his old coat doing little to shield him from the cold. The elevator doors opened, revealing Ian inside.

"Good morning," Ian said, glancing up from his phone.

Jay stepped inside. "Good morning. The weather caused some delays on the metro."

"I imagine it did. The roads weren't much better."

A subtle scent reached Jay, fresh and slightly spicy, rich without being overpowering. He'd never noticed Ian's cologne before. Now it seemed to fill the small space.

Jay looked at the floor numbers, trying to ignore the way his pulse had quickened. When the doors opened, Jay waited for Ian to exit first.

"Have a good morning, Jay."

"You too."

Jay walked to his desk, feeling off-kilter. When he went to make coffee, he was so distracted he nearly selected the wrong program.

The hours passed quickly, consumed by work. February had brought an avalanche of new client proposals. Since the weather was terrible and the workload had peaked, the team abandoned lunchtime outings. Jay ate at his desk.

By seven o'clock, most of the office had cleared out, but Ian remained working. Jay organized his materials but made no move to leave.

"Jay," Ian said, appearing at his desk. "You don't need to stay late."

"I don't mind. There's still work to finish."

"I appreciate the dedication, but don't feel obligated to match my schedule."

"I want to help."

They rode the elevator down together. Jay noticed that scent again. The elevator stopped at the ground floor.

"Have a good evening, Ian."

"You too. Get some rest."

Outside, the snow had continued falling throughout the day. The city looked magical, like something from a postcard.

Jay remembered being seven years old, racing through snow while his mother called for him to come inside. Would he ever feel that pure joy again?

He worked at home for two more hours. By the time he finished, his eyes ached. As he got ready for bed, the memory of Ian's cologne lingered faintly in his mind.

## Scene 2: New coat

Friday's temperatures seemed to bite through every layer. Jay pulled his old coat tighter, but the thin fabric did little to shield him from the arctic wind.

The metro had been delayed again. The office provided relief, but the atmosphere was tense with deadline pressure.

"Anyone interested in that new sushi place for lunch?" Kim asked.

"Are you insane?" Luc replied. "It's freezing out there."

"Plus we don't have time," Amy added.

Max appeared with takeout menus. "Lotus Kitchen delivers quickly."

The team agreed with weary resignation. Jay ate at his desk while reviewing a tricky spreadsheet.

As afternoon faded, Friday drinks were canceled.

"I'm going straight home before my fingers freeze off," Ela announced.

Jay stayed until eight-thirty, helping Ian finish a complex client request. Outside, the cold was unrelenting. By the time he reached his apartment, he was shivering uncontrollably.

His apartment felt like a sanctuary. He put milk on the stove, stirring in honey as it warmed.

Saturday morning brought no relief, but Jay had a mission. His old coat wouldn't survive another week.

In the fourth store, he found a wool overcoat that immediately caught his attention. The fabric was thick, the cut classic. The price made him pause, but he could afford this now.

"It looks very nice," the sales associate said. "That's one of our best winter coats."

Walking home in his new coat, he felt warm. The investment was painful but necessary.

Sunday was gray and gloomy. Jay worked through his materials at the dining table. The weekend had been productive but joyless, another casualty of the relentless weather.

## Scene 3: Company card

February continued with workload that made even experienced team members question their careers. Jay learned this was strategy season—when Turner & Associates truly earned its reputation.

"Welcome to the battlefield," Amy said, dropping files on Jay's desk.

The office atmosphere tensed. Sharp concentration was replaced by nervous bustle.

"Jay, do you have the analysis ready?" Ian called.

"On your desk," Jay replied. "I also pulled the comparative data."

Ian paused. "I didn't ask for comparative data."

"The numbers make more sense in context."

Ian smiled. "Thank you."

Each day blurred together. Jay stayed as late as Ian did, most evenings past eight.

"Another late night?" Luc asked, passing with his coat on.

"Seems that way."

"You know you don't have to prove anything anymore, right?"

"I'm not trying to prove anything. I just want to do the work well."

By Thursday of the second week, the strain showed on everyone. Kim had snapped over formatting. Even Max muttered about early retirement.

"Jay." Ian called. "When you have a moment."

"New client request came in," Ian said. "We'll need to restructure the Mayfield portfolio entirely. Can you block out the afternoon?"

"Of course. Should I reschedule your three o'clock?"

"Push it to tomorrow. This takes priority." Ian looked tense. "It's going to be a long day."

"I'll let the team know we might need them to stay late again."

"They're going to mutiny. Make sure they at least eat something."

Jay had been thinking the same. "Actually, I had a thought about that."

"What if we ordered from somewhere special tonight? Something that feels less like survival food."

Ian reached into his desk and pulled out a company credit card. "Use this for tonight. And going forward, actually."

Jay stared at the card. "Are you sure?"

"You should handle this kind of thing. I should have given you this weeks ago."

"Use your discretion. Within reason, but don't worry about the expense if it helps productivity."

Jay spent twenty minutes browsing the menu, keeping team preferences in mind.

The delivery arrived at seven, filling the kitchen with amazing aromas. Jay had ordered generously: herb-crusted salmon, braised short ribs, roasted chicken, and various sides.

"This is incredible," Zoe said. "Where did you find this place?"

"I've been keeping a list of restaurants that deliver to the financial district," Jay admitted.

Amy raised an eyebrow. "You research restaurants for work?"

"I research everything for work."

The kitchen filled with laughter. Even Ian appeared, surveying the spread with surprise.

"This looks excellent," he said. "Thank you for organizing it."

Work was temporarily forgotten as they compared favorite restaurants. Jay was drawn into discussions about the city's food scene.

When they returned to their desks, the atmosphere had lightened. Jay had made a small difference in his team's difficult day.

## Scene 4: Planning

The pace of February left Jay with little mental capacity beyond immediate work. When another HR message arrived about "Annual Company Retreat Update #3," Jay almost deleted it.

The email contained cheerful updates about the May retreat at a beachfront resort. Pristine white sand, turquoise water, spa services, championship golf course.

Jay had submitted his application back in January without much thought. But with HR's regular updates, the event kept surfacing.

During coffee break, he asked colleagues about their experiences.

"The place looks incredibly expensive."

"Oh, it is. Turner & Associates doesn't do anything halfway," Kim said.

"What exactly happens at these events?"

"Last year we went sailing. The year before that was skiing. They flew us to a mountain lodge."

"And everyone goes?"

"Pretty much. It's not technically mandatory, but it's heavily encouraged."

Amy joined. "The activities are actually fun. Good food, interesting presentations, enough free time to relax."

"What kind of activities?"

"Beach volleyball, kayaking, wine tasting, cooking classes. After the winter we've had, three days of sunshine will feel like paradise."

Jay tried to picture himself participating in beach volleyball with executives. The image didn't come easily.

"Are you worried about the retreat?" Luc asked. "It's much more casual than the gala."

"I'm just trying to wrap my head around it."

Jay returned to his desk, where another HR email waited about the April quarterly party. This felt manageable—an evening event, cocktails and dinner.

Another email arrived about vacation planning. Jay checked the calendar, but Ian's time off wasn't listed yet. He decided to wait until Ian submitted his plans.

Jay had no specific summer plans anyway. Security mattered more than adventure. He even kept a discreet envelope of cash tucked away as his last line of defense.

The team was still at their desks Friday evening.

"I'm starting to forget what sunlight looks like," Max complained.

"May can't come fast enough," Amy agreed. "Three days at a beach resort is sounding better every day."

For now, February's demands consumed his thoughts. Summer planning could wait.

## Scene 5: Evening work

The office had emptied gradually throughout the evening. Kim left first, followed by Ela, Luc, Zoe, then Max, and last Amy with a cheerful wave.

Ian remained at his desk, reviewing materials that demanded complete attention. He preferred these evening sessions when he could think without interruptions.

Jay never announced his intention to stay late. He simply remained, transitioning seamlessly from daytime tasks to evening support.

Jay monitored Ian's inbox, flagging critical communications and sorting less urgent matters. His organizational system had evolved, no longer requiring oversight.

When documents needed printing, Jay handled them without being asked. The small post-it notes in careful handwriting had become Jay's trademark.

"The Greenwell portfolio needs restructuring," Ian said, more to himself than to Jay.

"The last review flagged concerns about the tech sector allocation," Jay replied. "I pulled the performance data this morning. It's in the folder on your desk."

Jay had anticipated the requirement before Ian fully articulated it, a development that had become increasingly common.

"Thank you. Anything urgent in the evening emails?"

"Everest Capital wants to schedule a call for Monday morning. I've booked them at ten. Gelundis Fiduciary sent the documents you requested. I've printed them."

Jay's responses were always succinct and comprehensive. He understood the flow of Ian's work, the priorities, the details that could wait.

Ian noticed Jay's eyes drift to his empty coffee cup, the slight furrow of concern. Jay never presumed to offer refreshments, but his worry was evident.

For years, working late had been solitary and joyless. Now, Jay changed the atmosphere. He provided silent, supportive companionship.

But Ian felt guilty. Jay's dedication seemed boundless. Ian wondered whether he was taking advantage of Jay's eagerness to please.

Yet Ian couldn't send Jay home earlier. He extended work sessions to postpone returning to his empty penthouse.

"Ian. And Jay." Leo's voice interrupted as he appeared in the doorway.

Jay looked up, then rose and walked toward the kitchen, giving them privacy. Over months, Jay had developed obvious wariness toward Leo that manifested in blatant avoidance.

"Your assistant is remarkably discreet," Leo observed.

"He is."

"And devoted."

Ian's expression hardened. "If you have something specific to discuss, please get to the point."

"You look more relaxed than I've seen you in years."

"The workload requires extended hours. Jay understands that."

"Does he? Or does he simply enjoy spending time with his boss? At least you're not working yourself to death in solitary misery anymore."

"That's enough," Ian said sharply.

"I'm just pleased to see you looking less exhausted."

Ian couldn't formulate a convincing rebuttal. It was true that work had become more enjoyable since Jay's arrival.

His initial reservations now seemed foolish. Jay's shyness, his dedication, his awkwardness—all of it was too genuine to manufacture.

"He's competent," Ian said.

"He's more than competent. He's exactly what you needed. Just remember to occasionally acknowledge that fact."

After Leo left, Jay returned from the kitchen without comment about the conversation he'd deliberately avoided.

Ian continued working, aware of how Jay turned tedious drudgery into tender contentment. Jay was a gem—rare, valuable, and deserving of careful handling.

Jay had become an integral part of Ian's daily life. The realization was both comforting and concerning. Ian tried to keep emotional distance, but Jay was undermining those defenses without Ian quite understanding how or when it had happened.
