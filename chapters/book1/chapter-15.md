# Chapter 15: Inferiority
## Scene 1
Industry reading
The cold snap persisted throughout the week, generating daily debates about lunch destinations that had evolved from frustrated complaints into good-natured banter. The team's disposition had improved markedly since the brutal winter months—even when the weather disappointed, conversations held undertones of amusement.
"I'm staging a protest," Luc announced Wednesday morning, staring out the windows at yet another gray sky. "This is supposed to be spring. Where are the flowers? Where is the warmth? I demand answers from the meteorological authorities."
"File a complaint with nature. I'm sure they'll get right back to you," Kim said.
"At least it's getting warmer each day," Amy pointed out. "Yesterday was definitely less miserable than Monday."
She was right. Despite the continued overcast skies, the temperature had been climbing, making the walks to restaurants more tolerable even if they remained unpleasant. The promise of spring weather felt tantalizingly close.
The lunch expeditions varied in composition throughout the week. Some days half the team ventured out while others remained behind for delivery orders. Other days, everyone braved the weather with good-natured grumbling about April's fickleness.
But each day brought subtle improvement—a degree or two warmer, slightly less wind, occasional glimpses of sun that promised better weather ahead. By Thursday, even Luc had stopped lamenting the cold, though he continued to wear his winter coat with pointed emphasis on his suffering.
The approaching Easter weekend dominated conversation as the afternoon arrived. Four days off stretched ahead like a gift, the first extended break since the Christmas holidays.
"Family dinner at my parents' place," Max explained during their afternoon coffee break. "My mother has been planning the menu since February. She treats Easter like a culinary competition."
"Sounds lovely," Amy said. "We're driving to my aunt's farm. Fresh air, home cooking, absolutely no internet connection."
"I'm jealous," Zoe admitted. "I might hang out with some friends, but nothing definite. Probably just catch up on sleep and maybe see some movies."
"What about you, Luc?" Kim asked.
Luc's expression darkened comically. "Spending the weekend with my girlfriend's family. Three days of being interrogated about my career prospects and long-term intentions. I may not survive."
"It can't be that bad," Jay said.
"You don't know her father. He views every conversation as a job interview." Luc slumped in his chair dramatically. "I'd rather work through the holiday."
"No, you wouldn't. Nobody would rather work through Easter." Kim corrected.
"Fair point. But the family visit is still going to be torturous."
The group turned to Jay expectantly. "What about you? Any plans?"
"Nothing special. Rest, relaxation, maybe catch up on some industry reading I've been meaning to finish."
The reaction was immediate and unanimous.
"Industry reading? During a holiday weekend?" Max exclaimed.
"Jay, you're supposed to be resting. No work thoughts, no business materials, nothing related to Turner & Associates," Amy said.
Ela chimed in with equally dramatic warning. "You'll turn into Ian if you're not careful. He probably has financial statements bookmarked as leisure reading."
Jay laughed at their collective horror. "It's not really work reading. The industry publications  are interesting. Market analysis, regulatory developments, case studies of successful investment strategies—it's fascinating material."
"That's what Ian would say. Next you'll be telling us you enjoy reviewing compliance manuals for fun."  Luc observed darkly. 
"I don't enjoy compliance manuals. But understanding how markets function, learning about different investment approaches, reading about economic trends—that's actually engaging. It helps me understand the context of what we do here."
Kim shook his head in mock despair. "He's lost to us. Another casualty of corporate ambition."
"I'm not ambitious in that way. I just find it interesting to learn about the industry. It's not about getting ahead, it's about understanding."
"Promise us you'll do something purely recreational. Watch terrible television, read a novel, take long baths. Something completely unrelated to finance." Amy insisted. 
"I'll probably visit the library near my apartment. They have a good fiction section."
This seemed to satisfy his colleagues somewhat, though they continued to tease him about his idea of holiday relaxation. Jay didn't mind the gentle mockery—it felt affectionate, evidence of how comfortable he had become with the team.
By five, the office had begun its exodus for the long weekend. Jay remained at his desk longer than the others, organizing files and clearing his inbox for Tuesday's return. The administrative tasks that accumulated during busy periods required attention, and he preferred returning from breaks to clean systems without backlogs.
By five-forty-five, the office was nearly empty except for the cleaning staff. Jay gathered his things and prepared to leave, looking forward to four days without alarms or deadlines. But as he looked towards Ian's office, he could see him still absorbed in his tasks, surrounded by papers that indicated hours of additional work ahead. Ian showed no signs of preparing to leave, no indication that he recognized the approaching holiday weekend.
Jay paused in the hallway, wanting to say something but uncertain what words would be appropriate. He could suggest that Ian take the evening off, but that felt presumptuous. He could ask if Ian needed assistance, but that would obligate Jay to stay when he had already completed his own responsibilities. Instead, Jay approached Ian's doorway and knocked gently on the frame.
Ian looked up with mild surprise, as if he had forgotten other people existed in the building.
"I'm heading out. Just wanted to wish you a good spring break."
"Thank you. Enjoy your time off."
"Are you planning to leave soon?"
Ian glanced at the papers scattered across his desk. "I have a few things to finish up first."
Jay suspected that "a few things" actually meant several hours of complex tasks. The same deflection Ian employed whenever anyone said he might be working too much.
"Well, don't stay too late," Jay said, knowing the words were pointless but feeling compelled to say them anyway.
"I won't. Have a good weekend, Jay."
Jay left the office with Ian's response echoing in his mind, looking back as he headed for the elevator. Through the glass walls, he could see Ian already reabsorbed in his work, the papers and computer screen commanding his complete attention.
The sight made Jay feel something unfamiliar—less like admiration for Ian’s dedication and more like sadness. Everyone else was heading home to family dinners, countryside retreats, or simple relaxation. Ian remained alone in an empty office, choosing work over whatever personal life he might have waiting elsewhere.
As the elevator took Jay toward the lobby and the weekend beyond, he hoped that Ian would eventually recognize the value of rest and companionship. But he suspected that hope was probably futile.
## Scene 2
Easter
Jay spent Easter weekend exactly as he had planned—alone in his apartment with a stack of economics texts spread across his dining table. While his colleagues enjoyed family gatherings and countryside retreats, he immersed himself in monetary policy analysis and emerging market trends.
The decision wasn't born from fascination with macroeconomic theory, though he had grown to appreciate the subject's complexity. It stemmed from a persistent anxiety about his credentials that no amount of workplace success seemed to alleviate.
His economics degree from a local university had none of the prestige that seemed to follow his colleagues. Just a middling education from a third-tier institution that had been affordable.
Jay had never heard anyone at Turner & Associates make disparaging comments about his academic background. Ian treated him with consistent respect, his colleagues included him in discussions without condescension, and his work was valued regardless of where he had learned to perform it. But the knowledge of his inferior credentials gnawed at him regardless.
Leo's original hiring rationale—that Jay was attractive enough to serve as decoration while performing basic administrative tasks—had wounded him precisely because it highlighted what he already suspected. He would never have secured such a prestigious position based purely on qualifications. The bitter truth was that his looks had opened a door that merit alone would have kept firmly closed.
The economics textbooks represented his attempt to bridge that gap through self-directed learning. He had recently ordered them online, deliberately choosing volumes more advanced than the ones he had kept from his college days, that spoke more directly to the demands of his current position. If he couldn't change his educational pedigree, he could at least expand his knowledge base beyond what his modest degree had provided.
Friday and Saturday passed in concentrated study, interrupted only by meals and brief walks to prevent the eye strain that came from hours of reading. Jay worked through chapters on international finance, took notes on concepts that challenged his understanding, and flagged sections for future review.
Sunday morning brought his single concession to holiday tradition—a breakfast that echoed childhood Easter meals with his grandmother. Hard-boiled eggs prepared exactly as she used to make them, served with specialty ham and lamb that lent a festive touch to his simple kitchen.
The memory of those breakfasts was among the few pleasant recollections from his early years. His grandmother had been a stern woman, made bitter by the burden of raising her unwed teenage daughter and the illegitimate grandson who came with her. Love had been scarce in that household, but basic care was provided with grudging reliability.
Jay understood now that his grandmother had been overwhelmed by responsibilities she hadn't chosen. A woman in her fifties suddenly caring for a baby while supporting her own daughter through the consequences of poor decisions. What he remembered as coldness was more likely exhaustion.
But Easter breakfasts had been different. The holiday had softened his grandmother's severity, creating space for small kindnesses that made the meal feel special. Jay recreated that atmosphere as best he could in his adult kitchen, enjoying the memory despite the complicated emotions it brought.
His mother called during the afternoon, her voice holding the warmth that always made Jay feel guilty about their limited contact.
"How are you spending Easter, sweetheart?" she asked.
"Quietly. Reading, relaxing. How's your celebration?"
She updated him about the holidays and his half-siblings' school achievements. Ari was excelling in mathematics, Ema had joined the debate team, Tim was already considering college applications.
Jay felt happiness for his siblings, who would never experience the uncertainty that had defined his own childhood. They had a father who was present and engaged, a stable household where children were not accidental burdens.
"I'm glad they are doing well, Mom," Jay said, meaning it completely.
"Are you taking care of yourself? You work so hard."
"I'm fine, Mom. Really. The job is good, the people are nice. I'm exactly where I want to be."
It was true, mostly. After the call ended, Jay thought about the contrast between his siblings' secure upbringing and his own fractured early years. But he felt no resentment toward his mother or her husband, no bitterness about the different treatment. His mother had been barely eighteen when he was born, unprepared for the responsibilities that followed. She deserved the happiness she had found with his stepfather and the family they had built together.
Jay's circumstances were his own to manage. He had been dealt a particular hand—modest background, limited resources, questionable academic credentials—and it was up to him to play it as skilfully as possible.
He took a walk through his neighbourhood in the late afternoon, happy the weather was warm enough to make outdoor exercise pleasant. The streets were quiet, most people apparently occupied with family gatherings or social activities. Jay preferred the solitude, using the time to process the morning's reading while enjoying the physical movement.
Back in his apartment, he returned to the economics texts with renewed focus. On Monday he started the second, more challenging book—a dense analysis of global financial systems that required frequent breaks and repeated reading of complex passages. Jay made notes, flagged concepts for further research, and pushed through sections that tested his comprehension limits.
By evening, he had completed one book entirely and made some progress through the second. The weekend felt productive, a feat that purely recreational activities wouldn't have matched.
The irony wasn't lost on him—just days earlier, he had felt sad watching Ian work alone in the empty office, viewing such dedication as somehow tragic. Now Jay realized he had spent his own holiday in almost identical fashion, choosing development over social activities.
But he felt no self-pity about the parallel. Quite the opposite—he felt fortunate beyond reasonable expectation. Tomorrow he would walk into Turner & Associates and collaborate with brilliant, accomplished people who treated him as an equal despite his inferior credentials. That opportunity was far more than someone with his background had any right to expect.
The least he could do was work continuously to deserve it. If self-directed education during holidays was the price of maintaining his position among people who belonged in that environment, it seemed like a bargain worth accepting.
## Scene 3
Return to normalcy
The morning air was warm as Jay walked toward Northlight Financial Center at seven-twenty. He had shed his winter coat permanently, trading it for a light jacket. The earlier sunrise made the city feel more alive.
Turner & Associates' floor was empty when he arrived. Jay sat at his workstation and powered up his computer, scanning through emails that had accumulated over the holiday weekend. Nothing urgent waited for his attention—a comfort that would have been impossible during the brutal first quarter.
Ian arrived precisely at eight, looking more refreshed than he had in months.
"Good morning, Jay. How was your Easter?"
"Productive, thanks. How was yours?"
"Much the same. I managed to avoid checking emails for almost twenty-four hours. Consider it a personal victory."
Jay smiled. "That does sound like progress. At least you weren't here at six this morning."
"The early starts were getting ridiculous, even by my standards." Ian moved toward his office, then paused. "Did you do anything special for the holiday?"
"Read some economics texts, made myself a proper breakfast. Nothing elaborate." Jay kept his voice casual, not wanting to emphasize how solitary his weekend had been.
"Sounds perfectly reasonable. Better than the alternative of forced family gatherings."
Jay didn't press. He had learned to appreciate these brief moments of conversation without trying to extend them beyond their natural course.
By eight-thirty, the office filled with returning colleagues. Luc arrived looking distinctly less cheerful than normal, dropping into his chair with an audible sigh.
"Rough weekend?" Jay called from across the room.
"Girlfriend's family reunion. Her uncle monopolized every conversation with political rants, her grandmother criticized my table manners, and her cousin's children treated the place like a playground."
Amy emerged from the elevator wearing an expression of mild exasperation. "At least you had indoor plumbing. My daughters spent the entire weekend complaining about the lack of internet access at the cottage. Apparently, disconnecting from social media for three days constitutes cruel and unusual punishment."
"How old are they again?" Zoe asked.
"Fifteen and thirteen. Prime drama queen ages. They acted like I was punishing them personally by choosing a spot without reliable WiFi."
Max appeared cheerful, though he patted his midsection ruefully. "My mother outdid herself this year. Ham, roast, three different lamb dishes, and enough dessert to feed a small army. I may need to spend the next month living on salads."
Zoe pulled out her phone and scrolled through photos. "I went hiking with some university friends. We found this amazing trail system about two hours north of the city. The wildflowers are already blooming, and the views were incredible."
She showed the screen to anyone within range, displaying pictures of rolling hills dotted with early spring colours.
Kim and Ela arrived together, exchanging what could only be described as conspiratorial glances. When Max asked about their weekend, they both became unusually evasive.
"Oh, you know. Relaxing. Nothing special," Ela said, avoiding eye contact.
"Very relaxing," Kim agreed, then caught Ela's expression and stifled what sounded suspiciously like a laugh.
The exchange didn't go unnoticed by the rest of the team, but nobody pressed for details.
"What about you, Jay?" Amy asked. "Please tell me you did something more interesting than studying."
Jay hesitated, knowing his answer would provoke exactly the reaction he wanted to avoid. "I spent most of the weekend reading. Picked up some economics textbooks I'd been meaning to get through."
The response was immediate and unanimous.
"Jay, no," Luc groaned.
"Please tell me you're joking," Amy said.
"Economics textbooks? During a holiday weekend?" Max shook his head. 
Jay felt heat rise in his cheeks but tried to keep his tone light. "I enjoyed it, actually. Besides, it's useful knowledge for this job."
"You already do excellent work," Max said. "You don't need to study during your time off."
The conversation moved on to other topics, but Jay caught several concerned glances directed his way throughout the morning. He appreciated their worry, even if he couldn't explain why the weekend had felt exactly right to him.
The office resumed its previous pace. Projects moved forward without the frantic urgency that had characterized the first quarter. When noon arrived, the team gathered near the elevators to decide on their destination.
"Where are we going?" Max asked.
"Ela's been talking about that seafood place," Amy said.
Ela's face lit up. "The one with the incredible crab cakes? Yes! I've been craving them for weeks."
The suggestion met with general approval, and the group headed out into the warm afternoon air. Jay walked beside Kim, who was still exchanging secretive smiles with Ela.
The seafood restaurant was an excellent choice. The spring weather made outdoor seating comfortable, and the relaxed atmosphere encouraged conversation. Jay listened to his colleagues discuss work projects and the general improvements in everyone's mood now that the intense workload had eased.
He realized how much he had grown to value these moments. Six months ago, he would have been terrified of these gatherings, worried about saying the wrong thing or revealing his inadequacy. Now he contributed naturally to conversations.
The afternoon passed smoothly, with everyone handling their respective assignments at a sustainable pace. When five o'clock arrived, most of the team began packing. Jay, however, remained at his desk, pulling up formatting templates for reports that Ian would need the following day.
The office gradually emptied until only Jay and Ian remained. The workload didn't truly justify staying late, but the idea of Ian working alone evening after evening continued to bother Jay. He couldn't articulate why the image of his boss maintaining solitary vigil in the empty office seemed so troubling, but the feeling persisted.
He tackled minor tasks that had accumulated during the busy period. These could wait until later, but doing them now meant fewer distractions during regular hours.
Jay arranged his workstation thoughtfully, thinking how it might look to someone observing the space. His colleagues had personalized their areas with pictures, small decorative items, books. Zoe kept a small succulent plant, Kim displayed an action figure from some science fiction series, and Max had framed photographs of his family.
Jay's desk remained notably bare by comparison. He decided to bring one of the economics textbooks tomorrow—specifically the one he had finished over the weekend but found useful enough to keep as a reference. Perhaps some magazines as well, for the slower periods that might eventually arrive.
At eight o'clock, Ian emerged from his office carrying his briefcase and jacket.
"Ready to head out?" he asked.
Jay saved his work and gathered his belongings. They walked to the elevators together, the building now mostly empty except for security staff and cleaning crews.
"Thank you for staying late," Ian said as they waited for the elevator. "The extra preparation time helps with tomorrow's schedule."
"It's no trouble. Besides, the workload is finally manageable enough to catch up on things."
The elevator arrived, and they stepped inside. Jay pressed the lobby button while Ian selected the garage level.
"The pace is definitely more reasonable now. I appreciate everyone's patience during the difficult months."
"Everyone understands. Results like ours don't come without some sacrifice."
The elevator stopped at the lobby level, and Jay stepped out.
"Have a good evening," Ian said.
"You too."
The lobby doors closed, and Jay walked out into the spring air. The temperature had dropped enough to make his light jacket useful, but the evening remained pleasant as he walked toward the metro station.
The spring break had helped put the ordeal of the first quarter behind them. Jay felt a calm he wouldn’t have believed possible just weeks earlier, when every day brought new crises and impossible deadlines. The desperation of the winter months had finally lifted, leaving space for regular work that Jay had always preferred.
## Scene 4
Comfortable warmth
The weather turned pleasant as April progressed, warm enough for lunch outings to consistently happen without the constant complaints about the cold. Jay seized every opportunity to steer the group toward Willow & Sage, which had become his personal mission to explore completely.
"Their spring menu is great," he mentioned during Tuesday's morning coffee break.
"Not the bistro again," Kim groaned.
"The tomato basil soup is amazing. And I'm working through their entire soup menu systematically,"  Jay replied, unrepentant.
"How many varieties do they have?" Amy asked.
"Fourteen rotating options. I've tried eight so far."
He no longer flinched at spending so much money on lunch, his budget comfortably accommodating what had once felt like extravagance. The bistro's rotating soup menu had become his personal challenge—he was determined to sample every variety they provided.
The lunch crowd no longer required complex negotiations about time and location. Jay was at the centre of these casual arrangements, his enthusiasm for the bistro powerful enough to overcome any reluctance about the prices.
At Willow & Sage, he worked his way through a bowl of roasted fennel bisque while listening to Ela's gossip. The spring air drifted through open windows, bringing the scent of flowering trees from the nearby park. He couldn't remember the last time he'd felt this consistently content.
The workload had returned to manageable levels. The team rarely stayed past six anymore, the crisis-driven overtime becoming an exception. Ian still stayed late most nights, a habit that seemed ingrained regardless of actual necessity.
Jay occasionally remained when his own work warranted it—maybe once or twice a week, when documents required an urgent review. During these late evenings, it was mostly just the two of them in the office, working diligently side by side. Conversation, when it happened, was minimal and strictly confined to the task at hand. 
Even after all these months, Ian remained reserved, and Jay had learned not to expect more. They established a comfortable, if dull, pace. Ian didn't discouraged these stays. He was secretly elated by Jay's soothing company that brought some joy to those otherwise solitary hours.
The Friday drinks tradition had resumed with the return of reasonable schedules. Jay's refusal had become expected, meeting Luc's good-natured persistence with dry humour.
"Come on, Jay. Tomorrow's supposed to be beautiful. We could even sit outside at Murphy's."
"I'm sure the weather will be just as beautiful from my apartment window."
"You're missing out on valuable team bonding," Luc insisted.
"I'm bonding with this grilled vegetable panini right now. It's very fulfilling."
That afternoon, instead of heading straight home, Jay took a detour to the small park he'd discovered during his first weeks at Turner & Associates. He'd never returned since that initial exploration, too caught up in the anxiety of fitting in to spare time for simple pleasures.
The spring bloom had made the space more charming. Trees displayed clouds of pink and white blossoms, and flower beds showed the first bright colours of the season. The park felt more tranquil than he remembered, insulated from the city's noise by landscaping and the gentle murmur of a small fountain.
An artisanal ice cream truck had parked near the main path, with hand-painted menu board advertising flavours Jay had never heard of. He ordered something called sea buckthorn with honey and cream, curiosity overcoming caution with unfamiliar foods.
The bench where he sat faced west, catching the afternoon sun through the new leaves. Jay ate slowly, savouring the unexpected combination of flavours while watching office workers cut through the park on their way to metro stations and bus stops.
The contentment was unfamiliar, this desire to sit and simply exist without purpose or agenda. He'd never been someone who sought out moments of leisure, too accustomed to the anxiety that made stillness feel like wasted time. But here, with the sun warm on his face and the strange, delicious ice cream melting on his tongue, he felt at peace.
The lack of anxiety was still new enough to notice, like the absence of a headache that had been ignored until it disappeared. He thought about joining the team for drinks next Friday, imagining their surprise when he actually showed up. The idea made him smile.
Tuesday afternoons had become gym days, scheduled around Rus's availability. The trainer turned out to be a pleasant, easygoing man in his thirties who managed Jay's pace expertly, clearly accustomed to guiding beginners.
"Let's add five minutes to the treadmill today," Rus said during Jay's third week of regular attendance. "You've been building good endurance."
Jay could manage the treadmill with less difficulty than before, breathing steadily even as the minutes passed.
"How are you feeling?" Rus asked after twenty-five minutes.
"Less like I'm going to die," Jay admitted, stepping down from the treadmill  "Though still moderately terrible."
"That's progress. Your stamina is definitely improving."
Jay nodded, the five additional minutes feeling like a step forward.
"I've put together a simple set of exercises you can do at home," Rus continued, handing Jay a printed sheet. "Nothing that requires equipment or much space. It should help with overall conditioning."
The plan looked manageable: stretching, squats, pushups, and basic core work. Jay grudgingly committed to fifteen minutes every other day, fitting it into his morning, though he suspected his enthusiasm for home exercise would be limited.
The gym felt less intimidating than he'd feared. The other members were focused on their own workouts, paying no attention to his efforts. Jay took pride in the visible improvements—he could spend longer on the treadmill now before running out of breath, manage more pushups before his arms gave out. It was enough to maintain his motivation.
In the evenings, he'd taken to reading management books, studying team dynamics and effective leadership, on top of the economics literature he was already working through. The theoretical frameworks helped him understand the mechanisms behind Ian's seemingly effortless authority.
Every chapter reinforced his admiration for Ian's approach. What had appeared straightforward from the outside revealed itself as complex orchestration, requiring constant attention to individual personalities, group dynamics, and organizational pressures. Ian made it look easy, but the books made clear how much skill and experience went into that appearance of ease.
Jay closed the volume and set it aside, looking out at the city lights through his apartment window. The spring evening was warm enough to leave the windows open, bringing the sounds of traffic into his quiet space. Jay was content to savour this season of unexpected peace.
## Scene 5
Intrusion
Ian watched from his office doorway as Jay gathered his belongings at precisely five o'clock, the same pattern he had observed for the past several weeks. Every Tuesday without fail, Jay departed at closing time while other days he might stay late to tackle additional work.
Despite months of demonstrated reliability and competence, despite Jay's obvious dedication and honest character, Ian still paid him far more attention than necessity warranted. Not from suspicion anymore, but from fascination.
"Goodbye, Ian," Jay said as he was leaving.
"Have a good evening," Ian replied.
The office emptied gradually as the rest of the team left as well. Ian remained, reviewing performance reports. By six-thirty, the floor had fallen quiet. Ian emerged from his office, needing to retrieve files from the main storage area. But instead, he paused beside Jay's workstation, examining the small changes that had accumulated over recent weeks.
The space no longer maintained its original sterile state. Jay had added subtle personal touches that spoke to growing comfort with his environment. A spare suit hung in the small closet—a sensible precaution after the winter storm incident that had forced him to purchase emergency clothing. The desk drawers now contained basic medical supplies, evidence he had learned to prepare for unexpected circumstances.
Two items particularly caught Ian's attention: an economics textbook and several current issues of financial journals. The book was a respected academic text that Ian recognized from his own university years—intermediate level material that covered monetary policy, international finance, and market dynamics relevant to their daily work.
Ian picked up the textbook and immediately noticed the abundance of small coloured tabs protruding from its pages. Jay had marked passages extensively, creating a reference system. The sight triggered a memory of similar study habits from his own academic years, when textbooks became personal guides.
Ian knew he was crossing a line, but curiosity overcame his better judgement, and he opened the book to a random page. Jay's handwriting filled the margins—the same beautiful script that appeared on document annotations and project notes throughout their shared work. It created an unexpected sense of intimacy, as if Ian were reading private correspondence.
The notes revealed a structured approach to learning. Jay had not simply highlighted important passages but had engaged with the material, asking questions, drawing connections, and referencing additional sources. Comments like "check acquisition model—similar approach?" and "correlation with policy discussion from Monday's meeting" demonstrated that Jay was connecting theoretical concepts to their practical applications.
Ian sat on Jay's chair, drawn deeper into this accidental glimpse of how Jay's mind worked. The margins contained tiny revelations: moments where Jay had clearly struggled with complex concepts, breakthrough insights marked with enthusiastic exclamation points.
One dense section on international capital flows contained a series of increasingly confident notes. Jay had initially written "need to review this again—I don't get it," but subsequent annotations showed his growing understanding of the material. By the chapter's end, his notes had evolved into a detailed analysis.
The progression charmed him more than he cared to admit. Here was evidence of intellectual curiosity combined with effort—someone who refused to accept limitations imposed by his educational background and instead committed to continuous improvement.
Ian turned pages slowly, discovering more about Jay through his private academic conversations with himself. The young man emerged as someone who questioned assumptions, sought multiple perspectives, but at the same time remained humble. Comments like "am I understanding this correctly?" and "need to verify this interpretation" revealed someone more concerned with accuracy than appearing knowledgeable.
Some notes made Ian smile involuntarily. Jay had written "finally makes sense!" beside a complex explanation of derivative markets, and "why didn't they explain it this way initially?" after working through a challenging mathematical proof. The enthusiasm was endearing.
The journals contained similar annotations, though focused on current events. Jay had connected recent market movements to broader economic principles, noted discrepancies between different analysts' interpretations, and identified trends that related to their clients' investment strategies.
Ian had been reading for over an hour, completely absorbed in Jay's private educational journey. The invasion of privacy should have troubled him, but instead he felt a surge of affection he couldn't suppress.
These notes painted a picture of a person who approached learning with curiosity and without superficial ambition. The contrast with his own privileged educational background was stark—Ian had attended elite institutions, enjoyed access to the best tutors and materials.
Another lengthy note caught his attention: "The relationship between interest rate policy and employment figures is more complex than I originally understood. Need to reconsider some of my assumptions about decision-making. Maybe the delayed effects explain why Ian always seems to anticipate policy changes before they're announced?"
The mention of his own name made his heart skip a beat. Jay was trying to understand not just abstract economic principles, but the practical wisdom Ian applied in his daily decisions. It warmed him to know Jay’s thoughts had turned to him even in his private moments.
The building had grown completely quiet around him, the city lights beginning to dominate the view from the large windows. Ian closed the textbook, returning it to its exact position on Jay's desk. He remained in the chair for several more minutes, surrounded by the evidence of Jay's pursuit of knowledge.
Sitting in the empty office, Ian acknowledged what had been building for months despite his resistance. His attention to Jay's schedule, his awareness of Jay's reactions, his concern for Jay's well-being—none of it stemmed from obligation or suspicion.
It was becoming increasingly difficult to maintain the distance he had imposed between them, especially when every interaction revealed new reasons to be fond of the young man. Jay's dedication, modesty, consideration for others despite his own circumstances—all of it contributed to a growing attachment that Ian knew he should resist.
The feelings were dangerous and entirely inappropriate. Ian had learned that lesson the hard way, though he understood now that what he felt for Jay was fundamentally different from that earlier infatuation. Sam had been exciting—charming and magnetic, disarming Ian's caution. Jay was none of those things, but his warmth had somehow become essential. Whatever he felt for Jay, it had grown beyond his ability to rationalize it away.
Freefall
