# Chapter 2: Fitting in

## Scene 1: Solitude

Jay woke at six Saturday morning without an alarm. His body had maintained this schedule for years, a habit that served him well in every job he'd held. He rolled from bed and went to the kitchen area, where he filled the electric kettle and spooned pre-ground coffee into a white ceramic mug. A coffee maker was an extravagance his tiny studio simply couldn't accommodate.

While the water heated, he cracked two eggs into a bowl and whisked them with a fork. He sliced a piece of dark bread and set it aside, then poured the eggs into a small pan to make an omelet. His breakfasts were always simple and nutritious, just enough to start the day.

The kettle clicked off. Jay poured the water into the mug and let the coffee steep while he opened his laptop. The coffee was bitter and strong, exactly how he preferred it. He'd learned to drink it black during college, when cream and sugar were beyond his budget. The financial news website loaded slowly since his Internet connection was the cheapest available, but he had patience for small inconveniences. Oil prices had dropped overnight. The international markets were mixed. Nothing that would directly affect Turner & Associates, but context mattered in this business.

His phone sat silent on the counter. No missed calls, no messages. Saturday mornings had been different once, filled with texts from college friends and the occasional call from his mother. Those connections had faded naturally as geography and circumstances pulled everyone in different directions. He felt no particular sadness about it. People grew apart. That was simply how life worked.

Jay finished his breakfast and brought his coffee to the small table that served as both dining surface and desk to review his notes from the previous week. His work materials occupied one corner: a stack of printed client profiles and a pad where he'd been taking notes.

He pulled out the client summary and read through it again. The company manufactured specialized medical equipment, and their quarterly report showed steady growth in emerging markets. Ian had mentioned them briefly during Thursday's meeting, and Jay wanted to understand the full picture.

The morning passed quietly. Jay worked through his notes, highlighting unfamiliar terms and writing definitions in the margins. Algorithmic trading, derivatives exposure, regulatory compliance—each concept built on others, creating a framework he was still learning to grasp. The financial world had its own language, and mastering it felt like learning to speak again.

At eleven, he made a second cup of coffee and opened his laptop to a financial journalism website. The articles were dense and technical, but he read them patiently, cross-referencing names and companies with his notes. Everything connected to everything else in this industry. Understanding one piece meant understanding how it fit into the larger puzzle.

His phone buzzed. A text came from his mother: "Hope you're having a good weekend. The kids are playing soccer today."

Jay stared at the message for a moment, then typed back: "Thanks. Good luck to them."

He set the phone aside without waiting for a response. His mother's texts arrived sporadically, brief updates about his half-siblings or her husband's job. They felt like messages from a distant planet, well-intentioned but irrelevant to his current life. He preferred it that way.

Lunch was simple, a sandwich made from dark bread, turkey, and cheese, eaten while reading an article about emerging market currencies. He washed the plate immediately and returned to his work. The afternoon stretched ahead, filled with more reading and note-taking.

By evening, Jay had worked through most of his materials. His notes now covered six pages, each topic clearly organized. He felt satisfaction in the work, the same feeling he'd had as a student when a difficult concept finally clicked into place.

Dinner was more substantial. Jay set a pot on the stove and prepared a vegetable stew, adding chicken, beans, and plenty of herbs. He made enough for several days, portioning it into containers to freeze for the week ahead. It was a meal he preferred: healthy, filling, and easy to reheat after long days. Cooking in bulk had become a habit, one less decision to make during the workweek.

Sunday followed the same pattern. Jay woke early, made coffee, and spent the morning reviewing his notes.

After lunch, it was time to prepare his clothes. He pulled his shirts from the hamper and examined them for stains. They were clean enough to use again, though he'd wash them anyway. He owned seven work shirts, all identical except for minor variations in color, and rotated them to ensure even wear.

He did laundry in the building's basement, feeding coins into the ancient machines and watching for a while as his clothes tumbled clean. The other residents rarely used the laundry room at this hour, which suited him perfectly.

While his clothes washed and dried, he ironed the previous week's shirts. The iron was old but functional, and he'd learned to work around its quirks. Each shirt received meticulous treatement: collar pressed flat, sleeves creased properly, buttons checked for looseness. Appearance mattered at Turner & Associates, and Jay understood that his modest wardrobe needed to be immaculate to compensate for its simplicity.

The single plant in his apartment—a spider plant he'd bought during his first week in the city—sat on the bookshelf. It had thrived despite his minimal care, sending out runners that he'd trimmed back to keep it manageable. The plant was his only concession to decoration, chosen for its resilience.

He finished his preparations by evening. He packed his leather bag, checked that his shirts were properly hung, and set out his clothes for Monday. His apartment looked ready for inspection, every surface clean and every object in its designated place.

As daylight faded outside his window, Jay sat at his small table with dinner and an evening cup of herbal tea. The city buzzed below him, a constant background of traffic and distant conversation. He'd grown accustomed to the noise, though it had taken months to sleep through the sirens and honking horns.

Tomorrow would bring new challenges, more industry jargon to decode, more opportunities to prove himself worthy of the position Leo had given him. But Jay felt no dread at the prospect of Monday morning. Turner & Associates was demanding, but it was also predictable. Ian Hagen was exacting, but he was also fair. The work was complex, but it was complexity Jay could master through study.

He finished his tea and washed the mug, then closed his laptop and turned off the lights. Tomorrow would test him again, but he was ready for it.

## Scene 2: Performance

Jay took the metro to the financial district, the route now crowded with a different kind of commuter than he'd known in his previous job. The car filled with employees in dark wool suits, white shirts, polished shoes, and carefully knotted ties. Designer briefcases replaced the worn backpacks he remembered from his old commute to the less prestigious end of town. Jay found a handhold near the door and held his position as more passengers squeezed in at each stop.

Jay's own tie felt wrong. He'd adjusted it three times before leaving his apartment, but now it seemed too loose, or perhaps too tight. His reflection in the train window showed him what he already knew: he belonged to a different category entirely. His shirt was clean, his tie straight, but everything about him whispered budget store while his fellow passengers proclaimed boutique and bespoke.

He felt the strap of his leather bag against his shoulder. At least that piece looked appropriate, even if it held nothing more valuable than pads and cheap pens. His lunch sat in a plain brown bag tucked inside: a sandwich, wrapped in wax paper and accompanied by an apple.

The train pulled into his station. Jay moved with the crowd toward the exit, then climbed the stairs into morning sunlight. The financial district bustled with purpose, everyone walking faster than seemed humanly necessary. He'd learned to match their pace during his first week, though it still felt like an act of conscious performance.

Turner & Associates occupied an entire floor of an imposing glass tower. Jay arrived at seven-thirty, thirty minutes before the official start of business. The security guard recognized him now and offered a brief wave. The elevator rose smoothly, delivering him to an office that whirred with climate control but remained otherwise silent.

Jay sat at his desk and opened his laptop. Three new emails had arrived since Friday: a client inquiry forwarded by Amy, a meeting reminder from Kim, and a company-wide memo about updated security protocols. He read each one twice, filed them appropriately, and reviewed his calendar for the day. A morning briefing with Ian at nine, a client call at eleven, and a department meeting after lunch.

He pulled out his pad and reviewed the notes he'd made over the weekend. The Maven Holdings summary felt more manageable now that he'd researched their market position and competitive landscape. If Ian asked questions during the meeting, Jay would be ready with answers.

Footsteps echoed in the hallway. Jay looked up to see Ian approaching in a measured and confident stride, dressed in a refined three piece suit.

"Good morning, Jay." Ian's tone was pleasant, neither warm nor cold.

"Good morning."

Ian disappeared into his office without further comment. Jay had noticed that Ian arrived early every day, usually before eight but after Jay's own arrival. Ian never remarked on finding his assistant already at work, but Jay caught Ian looking at him intently, certain he was being evaluated.

The office gradually filled with life. Luc arrived with coffee from the expensive place downstairs, offering Jay a cheerful "Morning!" that Jay returned with what he hoped was appropriate enthusiasm. Amy nodded as she passed, absorbed in her phone. Kim mumbled something that might have been a greeting while juggling his laptop bag and a breakfast pastry.

By eight-fifteen, the department had achieved its normal working atmosphere. Jay lost himself in reading email responses, preferring tasks that required concentration over conversation.

At nine o'clock sharp, Jay knocked on Ian's office door.

"Come in," Ian called.

Jay entered with his notepad, ready to discuss the day's priorities. Ian gestured to the chair across from his desk.

"This morning I wanted to introduce you to some additional aspects of your role. Starting this week, we'll have regular morning briefings like this one. Around nine, though the timing may change depending on our workload."

"That sounds very helpful," Jay said, opening his notepad.

"These meetings will allow us to discuss daily tasks, review priorities, and ensure we're aligned on urgent matters. It's more straightforward than handling everything through email or conversations throughout the day."

"Should I prepare anything specific for these briefings?"

"A general overview of the day's schedule and any items requiring my immediate attention. Nothing elaborate. For today, I need you to compile a summary of the Maven Holdings quarterly performance. Focus on their technology sector investments and changes in their portfolio allocation."

"When do you need that completed?"

"End of week should be sufficient. It's for the board meeting next Monday."

"Understood."

"Excellent. Any questions about today's priorities?"

Jay reviewed his notes quickly. "I think I have everything I need."

"Good. We'll reconvene tomorrow morning at nine unless something urgent develops."

Jay returned to his desk with clear direction for the day ahead. The briefing system would definitely streamline their communication, and he appreciated Ian's approach to managing their workflow.

At twelve-thirty, Amy appeared at his desk. "We're heading to Cornerstone Cafe for lunch. Want to join us?"

Jay's first instinct was to decline politely and eat his brown bag sandwich at his desk. But Amy's invitation was friendly, and he'd learned that refusing too many social overtures could mark someone as antisocial.

"That sounds nice," he said, hoping his hesitation wasn't obvious.

The group consisted of Amy, Luc, Kim, Zoe and Ela, plus Jay trailing slightly behind as they walked to the cafe. They talked about weekend activities, office gossip, commentary on a news article Kim had read that morning. Jay only listened, trying to map the relationships and hierarchies that governed their interactions.

The cafe was crowded and expensive. A simple sandwich cost nearly three times what Jay would normally spend on lunch. He ordered hesitantly, choosing something modest while his colleagues selected elaborate salads and artisanal soups without checking prices.

They found a table near the window. The conversation continued its rapid pace, jumping from work projects to shared memories of previous colleagues. Jay answered direct questions about his hometown and previous job, trying to avoid topics that might invite follow-up inquiries.

"So do you live alone, or...?" Ela asked.

"I prefer my own company," Jay said, which was true without going into the details.

"Lucky you," Luc said. "My roommate leaves dishes in the sink for weeks. I'm thinking about moving out."

The conversation moved to housing costs and neighborhood recommendations. Jay listened but didn't contribute. His own rent consumed nearly half his salary, but that was information nobody needed to know.

Kim made a joke about their IT budget that everyone except Jay found hilarious. Jay produced what he hoped was an appropriate laugh, though he suspected his timing was off. The others didn't seem to notice, or at least didn't comment.

By the time they returned to the office, Jay felt as if he'd completed a marathon. The social performance had required constant attention—monitoring his expressions, remembering to make eye contact without staring. His colleagues seemed to manage these interactions effortlessly, but for Jay each exchange demanded conscious effort.

He spent the afternoon working through client correspondence and preparing materials for tomorrow's meetings. The research restored his equilibrium. This was work he understood, problems he could solve through preparation.

At five o'clock, Jay packed his bag and prepared to leave. Around him, his colleagues were doing the same, gathering coats and bags. Ian's office light remained on, as it had every afternoon since Jay's first day. Jay had never witnessed the hour at which Ian left. It made him wonder just how long Ian really stayed each day.

Jay joined the elevator exodus, riding down with Amy and Kim, who were discussing dinner plans. He nodded goodbye in the lobby and walked toward the subway station, already planning his evening. Grocery shopping for tomorrow, reheated dinner, thirty minutes of reading industry publications, an hour of reading client files, shower then early sleep to prepare for Tuesday's challenges.

The twenty-minute commute home passed uneventfully. Jay held his position while the train filled and emptied at each stop. His reflection in the window showed the same face that had ridden downtown that morning, but now it bore the satisfaction of another successful day.

## Scene 3: Mistake

Tuesday's lunch invitation came from Luc, Wednesday's from Kim. By Thursday, Jay realized that the group simply absorbed him without discussion. At twelve-thirty, someone appeared at his desk saying "Ready for lunch?" and Jay would close his laptop and follow them to whichever restaurant they'd chosen that day.

He stopped bringing his brown bag sandwiches on Wednesday, tired of taking them home uneaten and having to incorporate them into his dinner. The restaurant meals costs forced him to recalculate his monthly budget. He could handle the expense, but he'd need to cut somewhere else. Maybe the coffee shop near his apartment, where he occasionally treated himself to a real cappuccino. Or the small indulgences at the grocery store—the good olive oil, fresh herbs he rarely used but bought anyway. These adjustments felt manageable, even necessary. Fitting in required investment.

"Max gets back week after next," Ela mentioned over Thursday's soup and salad. "He's been island-hopping for three weeks. Lucky bastard."

"Wasn't he just at the seaside last month?" Amy asked.

"That was a long weekend," Luc said. "This is his real vacation. He's been planning it since Christmas."

Jay listened to their casual discussion of international travel with the same fascination he might have shown for accounts of space exploration. The longest trip he'd ever taken was a four-day seaside vacation, and that had required months of saving. The idea of spending three weeks on a tropical island existed in a realm so far from his experience that he couldn't even calculate what it might cost.

"You travel much, Jay?" Kim asked.

"Not really," Jay said, which was both true and sufficient.

The conversation moved to a concert Amy wanted to attend, a new restaurant Luc had discovered, Ela's plans to visit her sister. Jay contributed responses when asked direct questions but mostly listened, marvelling at the abundance that seemed to surround his colleagues.

On Thursday afternoon, a crisis erupted that felt monumental to Jay and barely registered with anyone else. At four-forty, while reviewing a client portfolio summary, he discovered an error in his calculations. The numbers were wrong—not dramatically, but wrong enough to affect the quarterly projections he'd prepared for Ian's review.

Jay stared at his screen, rechecking the formulas and feeling his stomach contract with each confirmation of the mistake. He'd built the spreadsheet carefully, double-checking each entry, but somewhere in the process he'd mixed up some figures and the error persisted in his subsequent calculations.

The office was winding down around him. Colleagues were closing laptops and gathering bags, their conversations moving from work projects to evening plans. Jay remained frozen at his desk, paralysed by the magnitude of his failure. He could stay late and rebuild the entire analysis, but that would take hours and still wouldn't erase the fact that he'd made such a basic error.

"Planning to work late?"

Jay looked up to find Ian standing beside his desk. His voice made it clear he was paying closer attention than he let on.

"I made an error," Jay said, gesturing helplessly at his screen. "In the portfolio analysis. The quarterly projections are wrong."

Ian moved around to look at Jay's monitor. Jay braced himself for criticism, perhaps a lecture about the importance of accuracy in their business. Instead, Ian examined the spreadsheet for a moment, then pointed to a specific cell. "Here's where it started. You transposed these two figures, which cascaded through the rest of the calculation."

He pulled up a chair and sat beside Jay, fingers moving across the keyboard. "See this formula? It should reference column D, not column C. Change that, and the rest will correct automatically."

Jay watched the numbers realign, the error disappearing as cleanly as it had appeared. "I'm sorry. I should have caught that before—"

"Everyone makes mistakes. The important thing is finding them before they reach clients. You did exactly what you should have done."

Jay remained at his desk long after Ian had left, reviewing every document he'd prepared that day. He checked formulas and verified calculations obsessively, determined never to repeat the same error. The office grew quiet around him, cleaning staff arriving to empty wastebaskets and wipe down surfaces.

At seven-forty-five, Jay finally closed his laptop and gathered his belongings. Ian's office light was still on. Through the glass partition, Jay could see Ian at his desk, absorbed in whatever work required his attention well past normal business hours.

Jay paused in the hallway, wondering if Ian worked twelve-hour days regularly or if tonight was an exception. The dedication seemed both admirable and exhausting—impressive in its discipline but depressing in its isolation. Ian ate lunch alone most days, rarely joined the group conversations in the break room, and apparently had no commitments that required him to leave the office at a reasonable hour.

The metro ride home passed in contemplative silence. Jay found a spot near the door and let his mind replay the afternoon's events. Ian's reaction to the error had surprised him completely. No lectures, just practical help and acceptance that mistakes happened. It was exactly the response Jay had hoped for but hadn't dared expect.

Back in his apartment, Jay reheated his dinner, eating at his small table while reading news articles on his laptop. He washed his plate immediately and returned to his work materials, reviewing his notes and preparing for tomorrow's meetings.

In bed later, with the lights out and the city's distant noise filtering through his window, Jay revisited the day's social interactions. Had he laughed appropriately at Kim's joke about the new software? Had his response to Amy's question about weekend plans sounded too curt? Did his colleagues find him acceptable, or were they simply too polite to exclude him openly?

The questions circled through his mind, each one echoing his larger fear: that he would never truly belong in this world, that his life would always require conscious performance. His colleagues' kindness felt authentic, but it also felt provisional, dependent on his continued ability to remain pleasant.

But as sleep began to claim him, Jay returned to Ian's calm response to his error. The absence of judgement, the practical help, the simple acknowledgement that mistakes were part of learning—it represented something Jay had rarely experienced. Not warmth, but fairness. Respect for his efforts even when they fell short.

It wasn't much, but it felt like solid ground beneath his feet. Jay could rest in the knowledge that his mistakes wouldn't define him here. Ian had shown him grace when he'd expected criticism. Jay closed his eyes and let the sounds of the city lull him toward sleep, holding tight to the memory of Ian's reassuring mentorship.

## Scene 4: Avoidance

On Friday morning the office moved at a gentler pace, as if everyone had collectively agreed to ease into the weekend. Jay arrived at seven-thirty, finding comfort in early start and preparation.

The investment analysis report sat in his inbox like a challenge he'd been wrestling with all week. Jay had drafted it twice, scrapped both versions, and started over with a different approach. The client's portfolio contained unusual holdings that required additional explanation, and Jay had struggled to find the right balance between detail and clarity.

This morning, the words flowed more easily. Jay worked through the analysis, checking each calculation and verifying every data point. By eleven-thirty, he had a complete draft that he felt confident submitting. He printed a copy for his own review, then sent the electronic version to Ian with a brief note requesting feedback.

Ian's response arrived within twenty minutes—a calendar invitation for a meeting at noon. Jay spent the intervening time second-guessing every paragraph, wondering if his conclusions were too bold or his recommendations too conservative. The investment world demanded confidence, but Jay feared that overconfidence could be equally dangerous.

The meeting lasted fifteen minutes. Ian read through the report, occasionally making notes in the margins. Jay waited, trying to read Ian's expression for clues about the document's quality.

"This is solid work," Ian said finally, setting the report aside. "Your analysis of the market exposure is comprehensive. The client will appreciate the level of detail."

Jay felt a surge of relief that he hoped didn't show on his face. "Thank you. I wanted to make sure I understood all the implications before making recommendations."

"Good instinct. Send it to the client this afternoon." Ian made a final note and handed the document back. "Well done."

The brief exchange left Jay energized for the rest of the day. Ian's feedback meant more than casual praise from colleagues who were still essentially strangers. His approval was valuable because it had to be earned.

Lunch followed the established pattern—the team's migration to whichever restaurant had caught someone's attention that day. Jay had grown more comfortable with the financial reality of these daily meals after adjusting his budget. The conversations still felt foreign, filled with references to experiences and assumptions he didn't share, but he'd learned to manage them without embarrassing himself.

"Any weekend plans, Jay?" Luc asked as they walked back from the sushi place Amy had chosen.

"Nothing special," Jay replied, which was true. "Catching up on some reading. Maybe a movie."

"You should check out that new art installation downtown. It's supposed to be amazing. Very interactive."

Jay nodded politely, though he had no intention of seeking out art installations. His weekends were structured around practical necessities—cleaning, laundry, grocery shopping, preparation for the following week. Entertainment was a treat he rarely allowed himself, and when he did, it took the form of a book from the library or a documentary on his laptop.

"Or there's that new craft brewery nearby," Kim added. "They're supposed to have incredible small-batch stuff."

The conversation moved on to various weekend options, each suggestion marked by prices that made Jay glad for his preference for solitude. His colleagues' casual discussions of extravagant dinners and theatre tickets reminded him constantly of the gulf between their financial realities and his own.

In the afternoon Jay worked through correspondence and prepared materials for Monday's meetings, enjoying the orderly progression of tasks completed and filed away. The office moved in its Friday atmosphere—productive but not frantic.

At four-thirty, Luc appeared at Jay's desk with a smile that seemed to be his default expression. "We're heading to Murphy's for drinks. Want to join us?"

Jay's pulse quickened. The invitation was casual, friendly, and completely expected—Friday afternoon drinks were apparently as routine as daily lunches. But the prospect of spending two hours in a crowded bar while trying to contribute to conversations about topics he knew nothing about felt overwhelming.

"I appreciate the invitation, but I have some errands to take care of this evening," Jay said, manufacturing what he hoped was a regretful smile.

"No problem. Maybe next week."

"Next time for sure. No pressure, though. We know not everyone's into the after-work scene," Amy added, overhearing the exchange.

The group gathered their belongings with the cheerfulness of people anticipating weekend freedom. Jay watched them preparing to leave, their lives seeming to flow seamlessly from work obligations into social activities.

"Have a good weekend, Jay," Kim called out as the group headed toward the elevators. Several others offered similar farewells in a warm tone.

Jay returned their waves and sat back at his desk. The office fell quiet except for the distant sound of cleaning crews beginning their evening rounds. He took advantage of the silence to complete a final review of his email correspondence, ensuring nothing urgent had been overlooked.

Ian's office light remained on, as it did most evenings. Through the glass wall, Jay could see him on a phone call with a serious expression. It was starting to become apparent that Ian worked longer hours than anyone else in the department, consistently arriving early and staying late.

As Jay packed his bag and prepared to leave, Ian concluded his call and looked up from his desk. Their eyes met briefly through the glass, and Ian offered a small acknowledging motion—barely more than a slight inclination of his head, but unmistakably positive. Another week completed satisfactorily. Another small confirmation that Jay was meeting expectations.

Jay returned the acknowledgement and headed for the elevators. The lobby was busy with evening commuters and building staff, but the crowd thinned as he reached the street. Office workers were heading home or toward the bars and restaurants where they would decompress from the week's demands.

Jay walked toward the subway station, feeling the satisfaction of another successful week behind him. The ride home passed in peace. In a few hours, his colleagues would be sharing drinks and weekend stories, deepening the personal connections. Jay felt no envy about missing that experience. He'd found what he needed at Turner & Associates—structured environment where his strengths could shine.

## Scene 5: Fear

Ian reviewed the investment analysis Jay had submitted that afternoon, marking corrections in the margins with his fountain pen. The work was competent—comprehensive research, logical conclusions, clear presentation. Jay had improved noticeably over the past two weeks, properly adapting to the firm's standards.

Which made Ian's persistent unease all the more troubling.

He set the report aside and pulled up Jay's employment file on his computer. The resume was modest but honest—state university education, six years at three decent firms, references that checked out when Leo had called them. Jay Hall appeared to be exactly what his credentials showed: a competent but unremarkable young man seeking stability and advancement.

The problem was that Sam Connelly's credentials had been equally unremarkable. Sam had presented himself as eager and slightly overwhelmed by the opportunity.

Jay exhibited nearly identical patterns. The early arrivals that looked like dedication but could indicate surveillance. The attention to appearance that showed respect for office culture but might serve as camouflage. The humble background that invited protective instincts but provided perfect cover for someone with sinister intentions.

Ian had spent two weeks waiting for Jay to reveal his true purpose, and Jay's complete failure to do so only heightened Ian's suspicions. Sam had been subtle but not invisible—casual questions about client relationships, innocent observations about office security, friendly curiosity about Ian's personal life. Jay asked no questions beyond those required for his work and maintained almost painful politeness in all their interactions.

The restraint felt calculated. Designed to lull Ian into the same complacency that had nearly destroyed his career once before.

"Working late again? It's Friday evening, Ian. Normal people have left for the weekend."

Ian looked up to find Leo standing in his doorway, tie loosened and jacket slung over his shoulder. Leo's definition of appropriate office attire had always been flexible, especially after business hours.

"I'm finishing up," Ian said, though his desk held enough work to occupy him for another two hours. "You should go enjoy your weekend."

"Not without my favorite CFO." Leo entered the office uninvited and dropped into one of the chairs facing Ian's desk. "How's our new addition working out? Jay seems to be fitting in well."

"He's competent."

"That's high praise from you. I remember when you described your last assistant as barely functional."

"Jay completes his assignments on time and follows instructions accurately. His work requires minimal revision."

"But you don't trust him."

"No. I don't."

Leo laughed with delight. "You're incredible. The kid shows up early, works hard, causes no problems, and you're convinced he's plotting against you. What exactly do you think he's doing? Stealing paper clips? Taking photos of your calendar?"

"I think he's being very careful not to show his hand too early."

"His hand? Ian, sometimes a modest young man is just a modest young man. Not everyone who works for you is running a long con."

Ian returned to his report, making notations in the margins. Leo's amusement was understandable but irrelevant. Leo hadn't lived through the Sam Connelly disaster. Leo hadn't spent months rebuilding his reputation while competing firms whispered about his judgment and competence.

"You know what you need?" Leo stood and walked to the credenza where Ian kept a small collection of glasses and a bottle of scotch for client meetings. "A drink. It's Friday evening, we're technically off the clock, and you're giving yourself an ulcer over an assistant who probably goes home and reads financial journals for fun."

"It's not appropriate to drink in the office."

"It's my father's office, technically, and he's been known to keep a bottle of bourbon in his desk drawer." Leo poured two fingers of scotch into each glass. "Besides, we're not drinking in the office. We're having a civilized conversation between friends who happen to be in an office."

Ian accepted the glass but didn't drink. Leo raised his own in a mock toast. "To paranoia and the fascinating ways it manifests in brilliant minds."

"To knowing where to draw the line," Ian countered, taking a small sip. The scotch was excellent, with enough warmth to chase away the fatigue of a long day.

They drank without talking for several minutes. Leo had always possessed the ability to fill quiet spaces without making them awkward, a skill Ian envied but had never mastered. Their friendship had survived the Sam Connelly scandal, Ian's family disowning him, and Leo's father's initial disapproval of hiring someone with Ian's complicated history. Leo might be a menace in countless ways, but to Ian he had proven himself time and again to be trustworthy—perhaps the most trustworthy person in his life.

"You're so convinced that everyone has ulterior motives that you can't recognize honest intentions when they're right in front of you."

"Experience teaches caution."

"Experience teaches paranoia if you let it. You've built a perfect life here, Ian. Successful career, financial security, the respect of your colleagues. But what's the point of having everything you want if you're too afraid to enjoy any of it?"

"I'm content with my life."

"Bullshit. You work non stop, eat dinner alone and haven't taken a real vacation in three years. You've turned contentment into a fortress, and now you're so busy defending it that you've forgotten what you were trying to protect in the first place."

Ian walked to the window. The financial district spread below him, office buildings glowing against the darkening sky. Somewhere out there, his colleagues were beginning their weekends—dinners with friends, dates with romantic partners, family gatherings that provided connection and meaning.

"My life works," Ian said finally. "It's stable and entirely under my control. That's worth protecting."

"Is it? Or is it just the safest option available?" Leo joined him at the window. "I'm not saying you should trust everyone who walks through that door. But maybe you could consider the possibility that not everyone is Sam Connelly. Maybe some people are exactly who they appear to be."

Ian bristled, turning away from the window. "You've meddled enough already, Leo. Drop it."

"I can't drop it when I see what's happening. Jay looked so lost this week. He can't find his place among all these accomplished colleagues, and he could use some comfort from his supervisor instead of this cold distance."

"That's preposterous," Ian said sharply.

Leo raised his hands in a gesture of surrender. "I'm just making suggestions. No need to get so defensive about it." He finished his drink and set the glass on Ian's desk. "I'm heading home to a weekend of questionable decisions and excellent company. You should try it sometime."

After Leo left, Ian returned to his desk and the stack of documents. He had no intention of providing comfort to Jay Hall, regardless of how lost the young man might appear. If Jay was struggling with the social demands of his position, he would adapt or find work elsewhere. If his vulnerability was a performance, Ian wouldn't be taken in by it.

He worked through the remaining reports, making corrections and preparing materials for Monday's meetings. By nine o'clock, he had completed everything that absolutely required his attention. He could stay later—there were always additional projects, long-term analyses that would benefit from extra attention. But Leo's words lingered in his mind.

Ian packed his briefcase and turned off his office lights. The elevator descended through floors of empty offices, delivering him to a weekend that would be solitary and predictable. He would review industry publications and prepare for upcoming client meetings. It was a good life. A life that no one could disrupt or destroy because no one was close enough to matter. Jay Hall might be the threat Ian suspected, or he might be as innocent as he appeared to be. Either way, the result would be the same. Some lessons were too expensive to learn twice.
