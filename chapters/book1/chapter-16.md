# Chapter 16: Preparations
## Scene 1
Client meeting
The morning sun streamed through Ian's office windows as he reviewed the final details for the Calder Wetherby Trust meeting. Outside, the city basked in a spring weather so perfect that it made even the most dedicated workaholic consider taking lunch outdoors.
"Jay, could I speak with you for a moment?" he called through his open office door.
Jay appeared within seconds. "Yes?"
"I have a meeting tomorrow with Calder Wetherby Trust. It's scheduled for one o'clock at their offices. I'd like you to accompany me."
Jay felt his stomach tighten. Client meetings represented territory he had barely explored during his time at the company. "What would you need me to do?"
"Take notes, primarily. Handle any documentation that comes up during the discussion. It's not complicated, but having someone there to track details allows me to focus on the conversation itself."
The request was reasonable—assistants accompanied executives to important meetings regularly. But Jay had grown comfortable with his behind-the-scenes roles. He rarely needed to participate in high-stakes client interactions.
"Is there anything specific I should prepare for?"
"Not particularly. Tomorrow's meeting is more relationship maintenance than active negotiation." Ian paused, seeming to consider Jay's obvious apprehension. "You'll do fine. Just bring your laptop and take notes on anything that seems important."
Jay nodded, already mentally reviewing his limited experience with client-facing responsibilities. The prospect made him nervous, but Ian's confidence was reassuring.
"We'll leave at noon to allow plenty of time. The meeting shouldn't run longer than an hour."
Ian rarely attended client meetings personally—that responsibility typically fell to Leo or the dedicated client relations team. Leo possessed the natural charm and social grace that made him perfectly suited for client schmoozing.
As CFO, Ian's role centred on internal operations and strategic oversight, and not the social management that such encounters required. But Ken Wetherby had specifically requested Ian, and when one of Turner & Associates' four largest clients made such requests, exceptions were made.
After Jay returned to his desk, Ian thought about the decision to include him. Officially, having an assistant present for note-taking was perfectly standard. Unofficially, Ian had grown accustomed to Jay's company and found the prospect of handling the meeting alone less appealing than it should have been.
The next morning brought cloudless skies and temperatures that made the walk to work pleasant. Jay arrived early, wearing what he considered his most formal suit—gray with a black tie. The combination was conservative to the point of severity, clearly chosen to project maximum professionalism. He took special care to ensure that every detail appeared flawless, from his precisely knotted tie to his polished shoes. The last thing he wanted was to embarrass Ian in front of such an important client.
At his desk, he spent extra time reviewing the Calder Wetherby file, but since it was one of the most important clients in their portfolio, he was already well-acquainted with their account history. 
At noon precisely, Ian appeared at his desk. "Ready?"
They descended to the garage level where Turner & Associates' company car waited. The driver held the rear door open as they got in. Jay had ridden in the company car before, but the vehicle still felt incongruous with his modest background. Leather seats and a partition separating them from the driver created an atmosphere of affluent privacy.
"The drive should take about thirty minutes. Traffic permitting," Ian said.
Jay watched the cityscape change as they moved from the financial district toward residential areas he had never visited. Glass towers and concrete gave way to tree-lined streets and architectural grandeur that belonged to a different era entirely. The buildings grew larger and more ornate, set back from the street by manicured lawns and elaborate landscaping. Even the sidewalks looked more expensive.
"I've never been to this part of the city," Jay admitted, unable to hide his fascination with the scenery.
"It's quite different from downtown. More space, obviously. Different pace of life."
The understatement was remarkable. Jay stared at mansion after mansion, each more impressive than the last. Wrought-iron gates, circular driveways, gardens that probably required entire teams for maintenance. The wealth on display was almost abstract in its magnitude.
Ian had grown up in this world and rarely thought about its impact on newcomers. Watching Jay's reaction reminded him of the first time he had brought Sam to similar areas, though Jay's response was more reticent than Sam's had been.
Where Sam had made jokes about excessive wealth and ostentatious display, Jay simply observed with appreciation for beauty. His wonder seemed untainted by resentment or cynicism. Ian looked away before Jay caught him staring. The comparison to Sam was unfair and unhelpful—Jay had never given him reason to doubt his sincerity. The awe in Jay’s expression was endearing, though Ian tried not to find it as charming as he did.
"We're making good time," Ian observed, glancing at his watch. He spoke to the driver through the intercom. "We have some extra time. Take us through Riverside Park  before heading to the office building."
The detour revealed a street lined with what could only be described as architectural masterpieces. Victorian mansions competed with modern estates, all surrounded by grounds that resembled public parks. Jay tried not to gawk, but the sight was spectacular.
One particular mansion caught his attention—a limestone structure with towers and bay windows that looked like something from a historical drama. The grounds included a golf course and a guest house larger than Jay's entire apartment building.
"Impressive," Jay said quietly.
Ian didn't comment, but Jay thought he detected the hint of a smile on his face.
The Calder Wetherby Trust occupied a building that seemed to have been transported from nineteen-century. Dark wood panelling, crystal chandeliers, and soft rugs created an atmosphere of established wealth that made Turner & Associates' modern style seem almost casual by comparison.
Jay's eyes widened slightly as they were escorted through the entrance hall, but he quickly composed himself and followed Ian's lead toward the executive offices.
Ken Wetherby greeted them in a reception area dominated by oil paintings of stern-looking men in formal attire. He was perhaps sixty, with silver hair and confident bearing that came from generations of inherited authority.
"Ian, excellent to see you," Ken said, extending his hand.
"Ken, thank you for accommodating our schedule. This is Jay Hall, my assistant."
The introduction was polite but perfunctory. Jay understood immediately that his role was to remain largely invisible while the important conversation took place.
They moved to Wetherby's office, where leather-bound books lined the walls and afternoon light filtered through leaded glass windows. Jay positioned himself at a small side table with his laptop while Ian and Wetherby sat on armchairs near a fireplace.
The meeting that followed was unlike anything Jay had expected. Instead of financial analysis or contract negotiations, the conversation meandered through topics that seemed almost social. Tennis, mutual acquaintances, a brief discussion about whiskey that led Wetherby to pour drinks despite the early afternoon hour.
Jay typed diligently, capturing what little business content emerged from the discussion. A  mention of "exploring opportunities in the emerging markets," and a casual comment about "moving forward with the infrastructure investment we discussed."
Each seemingly offhand remark involved sums that made Jay's head spin. Hundreds of millions addressed as casually as discussing weekend plans. When Ken mentioned expanding their portfolio by another two hundred millions, Jay's typing intensified slightly, but he showed no other reaction to figures that would have represented astronomical sums to most people.
After about one hour, Ian glanced at his watch and made polite excuses about not taking up more of Wetherby's time. The farewell was warm but brief, with promises to "do this again soon" and instructions to "give my regards to Leo."
"That was more politics than business," Ian explained as they walked back to the car. "But sometimes these relationship visits are more important than formal presentations. Wetherby likes to feel that his account receives personal attention from senior leadership."
Jay processed this information as they got back into the car. The meeting had been essentially a social call dressed up as business—an expensive way to maintain goodwill with a client who could afford to demand such treatment.

## Scene 2
Tingling
"Since we're out during lunch hours, we might as well make the most of it. There's a restaurant nearby that's worth trying," Ian said.
"That sounds good."
The car delivered them to an establishment that epitomized the district's sophisticated atmosphere. The building was elegant, with the entrance marked by brass fixtures and flowering plants.
The server led them to a private dining room with views of a small garden courtyard. Jay felt the unease of being surrounded by extravagance beyond his reach, but Ian’s relaxed demeanour helped him ease into the experience.
"Order whatever appeals to you," Ian said, scanning the menu. "It's a business expense."
Jay appreciated the clarification because the prices were shocking. Despite the reassurance, he selected one of the more modest options while Ian selected items that made it clear he was treating the meal as an indulgence.
"I don't often deviate from my meal plan. But occasional exceptions are worth making," Ian admitted when the server left.
"I imagine your gym trainer wouldn't approve."
"What my trainer doesn't know won't hurt him."
The food, when it arrived, justified its cost. Jay's salmon was prepared with a complexity of flavours he had never experienced, while Ian's selections created a meal that seemed designed for savouring.
"The Wetherby family has been in this area for generations. Ken's grandfather established the trust in the 1920s. Old money, established connections, a client that values tradition over innovation."
Jay listened carefully, filing away information that might prove useful in future interactions. Ian rarely shared private background details about clients, and Jay was fascinated by the insights into the world they just witnessed.
"The Calder Wetherby Trust has been with us since Leo's father started the company. Ken inherited the relationship along with the fortune, but he's been remarkably hands-off about management decisions."
"Is that common with clients of that size?"
"Depends on the individual. Some want detailed reports and frequent updates. Others prefer to review annual summaries and leave the details to experts they trust."
Ian continued sharing background information about various clients and the different approaches required for each relationship, and Jay absorbed every detail.
"I grew up not far from here," Ian eventually said, indicating a tree-lined street visible in the distance.
The revelation didn't surprise Jay—he knew about Ian's affluent origins. But hearing it confirmed created a new understanding of the gulf between their backgrounds.
"It must have been incredible, growing up surrounded by all this." 
"It had its advantages," Ian said. The conversation was veering toward personal territory he usually avoided, but Jay's honest interest made the disclosure feel natural.
"I can't imagine having access to so much beauty and culture from childhood."
"Beauty doesn't necessarily translate to happiness."
The comment hinted at complexities Jay didn’t feel comfortable exploring, though it brought out a human side of Ian that their relationship seldom revealed.
"Where did you grow up?" Ian asked, though he already knew the basic details from Jay's employment file.
"Small town about four hours south. More farmland than culture, but it had its own appeal. Different kind of beauty."
"More freedom to roam without worrying about property lines."
The comment hinted at the constraints of Ian's privileged upbringing. Jay wanted to ask more questions but didn't dare push beyond what Ian volunteered.
"There was nice countryside nearby. I used to ride my bicycle to explore forests and follow the river, during the moments when I was allowed to."
Ian detected a slight defensiveness that hinted at complicated feelings about his origins. He didn't press for additional details. Instead, he continued describing the neighbourhood's history, pointing out architectural details that most visitors missed. 
Dessert appeared without Jay ordering it—Ian's suggestion that they share something described as "seasonal fruit with champagne reduction." The presentation was more art than food, and the taste was subtle enough to make Jay wonder if his palate was adequately developed to appreciate what he was experiencing.
"This has been really nice," Jay said, meaning it completely.
"I'm glad. You handled the meeting well."
The praise created warmth in Jay's chest that seemed disproportionate to the simple compliment. But Ian's approval meant more to him than he cared to examine too closely.
When they finally left the restaurant, the afternoon had advanced to past three o'clock. The leisurely meal had stretched far beyond Jay's expectations, creating an experience that felt personal despite the business context.
Traffic had thickened during their extended lunch, turning the return drive into a slow crawl through city streets. Jay stole glances when he thought Ian wasn't paying attention, struck by details he rarely allowed himself to observe. 
The cologne was particularly distracting—something that Jay had begun to associate with their morning conversations. In the car's narrow space, the scent seemed more noticeable, making his thoughts wander in directions he tried to avoid.
Sitting so close to Ian, watching the afternoon light play across his features, breathing in the scent of his cologne—it reminded him of those winter evenings when they had worked late together, surrounded by the festive glow of decorations, the dreamlike warmth creating a closeness that felt almost intimate.
Ian didn’t seem irritated by the delay, leaning back in his seat with the same ease he had shown all day. He looked out at the landscape sliding past, his thoughts elsewhere, the stillness sharpening the refined lines of his profile.
The traffic jam forced them into closer proximity than their usual interactions allowed. Ian could sense Jay's occasional glances, could see the slight flush in his cheeks. The younger man's fascination with the day's experiences, his transparent reactions,  his obvious efforts to appear collected despite his nervousness combined to create a portrait of earnest determination that Ian found almost irresistible. The atmosphere in the limousine felt charged, becoming increasingly difficult to dismiss.
When they finally arrived at Northlight Financial Center, Jay stepped out into the fresh May air and felt a flutter in his stomach. The afternoon had been unlike anything in his previous experience at Turner & Associates—formal yet somehow personal.
As they rode the elevator back to their floor, Jay realized the day had changed something in his understanding of his relationship with Ian. Not dramatically, but enough to leave him feeling slightly off-balance.
"Thank you for today," he said as they reached their floor.
"You're welcome. I hope it was informative."
Jay returned to his desk with the lingering awareness that the afternoon had been more than informative. It had been enjoyable, probably more than was entirely appropriate.
The day had shown him glimpses into Ian's world—both the privileged background that had shaped him and the personal qualities that made him such an exceptional leader. Those insights felt precious, not for advancing his career, but for deepening his understanding of the man he had grown to admire so deeply.
Jay gathered his belongings and prepared to leave for the day—it was already past normal closing time, and the extended lunch had disrupted his schedule.
"Have a good evening," he said, then headed toward the elevators.
Ian watched Jay leave, then sat behind his desk without immediately beginning any work. The afternoon had been unexpectedly pleasant, and that created complications he wasn't sure how to address.
He told himself it was nothing more than the charm of an unusual day, a pleasant deviation that would fade once normal schedules resumed. The attraction he felt toward Jay was manageable as long as he maintained distance.
But without suspicion to color his perceptions, Ian found Jay's earnest dedication almost impossibly endearing and increasingly difficult to resist. He sat alone in his office the whole evening, trying to convince himself that he could keep his heart on a leash despite mounting evidence to the contrary.
## Scene 3
Disgusting beer
Jay had spent Friday in unusually high spirits, buoyed by the success of the previous day's client meeting and the growing confidence that came from nearly a year of achievements.
As the clock neared five, Luc appeared at Jay's desk with a resigned expression that had become part of their weekly ritual.
"Murphy's is doing happy hour for their craft beers tonight," Luc said with theatrical casualness. "You interested?"
"Sure," Jay said, not looking up from his computer screen.
The silence that followed was so complete that Jay finally raised his eyes. Luc stood frozen, mouth slightly open, as if he'd forgotten how to process unexpected information.
"I'm sorry, what did you say?"
"I said sure. Seven o'clock, right?"
"Are you serious?" Luc's voice cracked slightly on the last word.
"Completely. Though I reserve the right to leave if the beer is terrible."
The team had gathered near his desk on their way to the elevators, and Jay's casual acceptance drew surprised laughter from everyone within earshot. Amy raised an eyebrow, Ela looked delighted.
"About time you gave in to peer pressure. We were beginning to think you were morally opposed to fun." Max said.
Kim made a show of checking his phone calendar as if to mark the historic moment. "Did hell freeze over? Should we be worried about the apocalypse?"
From his office, Ian observed the scene through his open door. The sight of Jay's warm smile, his integration into the group that had once seemed so impossible, made Ian happy for an instant, but left behind a dull ache of wanting something he knew he shouldn’t.
"Have a good evening, Ian," Jay called out as he left.
"You too."
The team headed for the elevators and Ian was unable to focus back on the reports waiting on his desk. The office felt too quiet after the laughter that had echoed from Jay's corner. The thought of staying late felt unbearable, so he gathered his things and headed home, something he rarely did before seven.
His penthouse's gym provided the outlet he needed, and he pushed himself through an exhausting workout that left him too tired to think about Jay's smile or the way his colleagues had embraced him so completely.
Instead of commuting home and back, Jay decided to try a local restaurant he'd passed countless times but never entered. Dining alone had never held any appeal, but tonight it served its function well enough. The pasta was adequate and the experience satisfactory if not memorable.
Murphy's was already crowded when he arrived at seven, the happy hour crowd creating an animated atmosphere that usually made Jay want to retreat. But tonight, surrounded by familiar faces, the energy didn't feel as overwhelming. Max dominated the space with his booming voice and endless supply of stories, Amy provided dry commentary, and Kim and Ela continued their subtle flirtation that nobody acknowledged directly.
Jay ordered whatever Luc recommended and immediately regretted it. The craft beer was aggressively bitter, an assault on his palate that made him wince with each sip.
"This is awful," he announced, earning sympathetic laughter from the group.
"It's an acquired taste," Amy said diplomatically.
"I'm not sure I want to acquire it," Jay replied, though he continued drinking.
"So the retreat is coming up in two weeks. Has everyone figured out what they're wearing?" Zoe asked.
The comment triggered a general discussion about the upcoming event. Suddenly everyone was discussing preparations with the enthusiasm of people planning a military campaign.
"The weather forecast looks perfect. I packed three different swimsuits just in case." Amy said.
"I finally found the perfect evening dress. Midnight blue with just enough sparkle to catch the light without being overdone." Ela added.
Jay listened with growing awareness of his own lack of preparation. Swimming shorts, resort-appropriate clothing, luggage that didn't look like it belonged in a thrift store—he'd given none of it serious thought.
"What about you, Jay? Ready for three days of indulgence?" Kim asked.
"I should probably think about packing soon," Jay responded with forced casualness.
"You haven't started yet? The dress code for the evening events alone requires serious planning." Luc asked.
"The dinner on the first night is always elegant. Business casual at minimum, though most people dress up more than that." Amy explained. 
"And the pool parties can get pretty wild," Max added with obvious enthusiasm.
Jay's anxiety began to spike as the conversation continued. Pool parties, bonfire nights on the beach, sunset dinners with senior partners—none of these activities fit with his limited wardrobe of work suits and basic casual wear.
"What about the beach bonfire? What does everyone usually wear for that?" 
"You want to look good but not overdressed. Think expensive jeans, quality polo shirts, maybe a nice jacket for when it gets cooler," Ela said immediately. 
"The key is looking effortless. Like you just threw on whatever was closest but it happened to be straight off this season’s runway," Kim chimed in.
Everyone laughed at the comment, but Jay recognized the underlying truth. His colleagues possessed an intuitive understanding of social dress codes that he had never developed. They knew how to calibrate their appearance for different contexts, oscillating between formality and sophisticated casual wear.
"I should probably do some shopping," Jay admitted, hoping his voice didn't betray his growing panic. 
"Definitely. There are some great places downtown if you want to invest in pieces you'll actually wear again." Ela agreed enthusiastically.
"Ela and I can give you some recommendations. There are a few boutiques that specialize in exactly what you'll need." Amy said.
"The important thing is getting the foundation right. A few really good pieces that you can mix and match for different events." Ela added.
Jay felt overwhelmed as his colleagues began discussing specific stores, brands, and styling approaches. Their advice came from a desire to help, but it also highlighted how much he still didn't know about the social aspects of this world.
"Don't worry," Max said, apparently noticing Jay's expression. "Everyone feels underprepared for their first retreat. The important thing is showing up and being yourself." 
"Easy for you to say," Luc replied. "You've been doing this for years. Jay's only just walking into social events with senior partners. The pressure is real."
The observation did little to calm Jay’s nerves, though he appreciated Luc’s recognition of the subtext. This wasn't just casual socializing—it was networking disguised as recreational activity. Jay made mental notes about everything his colleagues mentioned, each detail added to his growing to-do list for the weekend.
By the time Jay made his excuses two hours later, he had barely managed half of the terrible beer. He thanked everyone for their patience with his beverage complaints and headed home feeling both invigorated by the friction-free social outing and increasingly anxious about his lack of preparation.
## Scene 4
Shopping spree
Jay spent Friday evening turning his dining table into a strategic planning centre, spreading out handwritten notes with his colleagues' advice alongside printouts of store locations and hours. The boutiques Ela and Amy had recommended clustered in the fashion district, an area of the city he had visited perhaps twice in his entire life. He studied the information, creating a route that would maximize his time. The prices he had researched online made his stomach clench, but he reminded himself that this was an investment in his future.
Dinner attire occupied the top priority, but he also needed swimming shorts, casual resort wear, and something appropriate for other evening events. The challenge was finding clothes that looked suitable without making him stand out as either under-dressed or trying too hard. 
Jay woke Saturday morning determined, approaching the shopping trip as though it were a mission. He ate a big breakfast, knowing from experience that shopping required sustained energy, then reviewed his notes one final time before heading out, armed with his itinerary.
His first stop was a menswear boutique that Ela had specifically recommended for "foundation pieces that work across multiple contexts." The sales associate was an impeccably dressed man in his thirties, clearly used to sizing up customers’ needs and budgets, and he assessed Jay with a critical glance.
"I need clothes for a corporate retreat. Pool parties, beach events, dinners with clients." Jay explained.
"Certainly. Let's start with the basics and build from there."
The associate steered Jay toward pieces that could transition between formal and everyday settings, explaining the differences between resort casual and weekend casual that Jay would never have understood independently.
"This polo is versatile enough for pool events but sophisticated enough for dinner if you pair it with the right trousers," he explained, adjusting the collar.
Jay tried on several polo shirts, examining himself in mirrors that seemed designed to highlight every flaw in his posture and bearing. The associate offered guidance about fit and styling, suggesting choices that would work for multiple occasions.
A warm sand blazer that could work for the sunset dinner but also evening drinks. Chinos in earthy colours that paired with both polo shirts and button-downs. A selection of shirts that looked effortless but refined.
"Quality over quantity. Better to have fewer pieces that work perfectly than a closet full of clothes that never quite fit the occasion," the associate advised.
By the time Jay left the boutique, he had acquired two bags full of clothes, but his list remained only partially complete. Pool attire, beach outfits, casual shoes, and various accessories still needed attention.
The second boutique focused on what they called "resort wear," and Jay discovered that clothes designed for wealthy people's vacations constituted an entire category he had never known existed. Linen shirts with, lightweight trousers, jackets that could transition from beach to dinner settings.
"The key is quality fabrics that photograph well. Natural fibres, good drape, colours that work in different lighting conditions", the sales associate explained while showing him a selection of shirts.
Jay hadn't considered that his clothes would need to photograph well, but the comment made sense given the likelihood of group photos during retreat activities.
By the third store, Jay's decision-making abilities had deteriorated. The constant choices between similar-looking items and the pressure to understand distinctions he had never needed to consider started to create mental exhaustion.
Nearly four hours had passed since he’d left home, and he was already tired and hungry. Still, with plenty left on his list, he grabbed a quick, unremarkable lunch at a nearby restaurant before heading back out. There was no time to linger or enjoy the break, so he simply regrouped and continued his shopping spree.
The swimming shorts required more consideration than he'd expected. The swimwear boutique salesperson assured him that board shorts in blue were both practical and appropriate for any setting. Jay trusted her judgement, having no framework for evaluating swimwear beyond basic coverage. He finally selected swim shorts in classic navy and a more adventurous pair with subtle patterns, hoping they struck the right balance between appropriate and interesting.
Three stores later, laden with shopping bags and feeling the fatigue that came from making countless micro-decisions about style and fit, Jay sought refuge in a café. The establishment catered to shoppers taking breaks from their retail expeditions, offering comfortable seating and prices that matched its exclusive neighbourhood.
Jay ordered coffee and a pastry, spreading his remaining shopping list across the small table. He had completed most of his intended purchases, but the process wa far more exhausting than he had anticipated. Every item required consideration of versatility, quality, and cost. The sheer number of variables involved in selecting clothes that would allow him to blend into his colleagues' social world felt overwhelming.
Jay finished his coffee and returned to his mission. The afternoon progressed through a succession of boutiques, each specializing in different aspects of his wardrobe requirements. Casual shoes that looked expensive but comfortable enough for walking on sand. A lightweight jacket for evening beach gatherings. Short sleeved shirts in colours that complemented his complexion without being too bold. At each store, he relied heavily on sales associates' guidance, acutely aware of his own ignorance about fashion matters.
His biggest purchase was a new suitcase, an upgrade from the secondhand case that had served him since college. The quality luggage commanded prices that made him pause, but his tolerance for necessary expenses had grown. The investment felt justified by the battered condition of his current case.
The total bill was another blow to his frugal sensibilities, though not the devastating expense of his winter emergency shopping—roughly equivalent to two months of his previous salary, which was still less that he earned now. He consoled himself that at least this time he hadn't spent thousands on a single outfit. More concerning was his uncertainty about whether the assembled wardrobe would actually achieve its intended purpose.
When he returned home with a suitcase full of expensive clothing, Jay sighed heavily at the sight of his overcrowded closet. He'd have to donate another round of older pieces to make room, a cycle that was becoming unfortunately familiar.
He tried everything on again, critically examining his reflection. The clothes fit well enough, though he looked pale and slightly too thin. The winter flu had taken weight he hadn't quite regained, leaving him with sharper angles than he remembered. At least he didn't have to worry about a beer belly.

## Scene 5
Growing uncertainty
Jay returned to work Monday satisfied. His new wardrobe hung neatly in his closet, tags removed and items organized by function, ready for the upcoming retreat. The weekend's shopping expedition had been exhausting but productive, and he felt reasonably confident about his preparations. 
That confidence lasted exactly three days.
By Wednesday, as the retreat discussion intensified around the office, Jay began to understand that he had seriously miscalculated the sunset dinner's importance and dress expectations. 
Amy and Ela exchanged recommendations for designer evening wear, their casual mentions of brand names and price ranges making Jay realize he’d underestimated the event’s formality.
“I’m thinking the Cél d’Ambroisie wrap dress with the Aul Ciel sandals for the sunset dinner,” Amy explained during lunch.
“I’m going with the Bas Roque jacket with the new Eno Aquila shirt. Classic but not boring,” Max added.
Even Kim, who typically dressed simply, mentioned designer pieces that Jay recognized from his brief exposure to high-end fashion magazines. The casual way his colleagues discussed garments costing thousands suggested that such expenditures were routine.
Jay cornered Luc on Thursday, trying for casual curiosity. "What's the actual dress code for the dinner party?"
"It's probably the single most important social event of the year. The black-tie gala is elegant, sure, but it's also pretty conservative. Everyone wears standard formal wear and calls it a day. The annual retreat dinner is where people really outdo themselves."
Jay's stomach dropped. "No pressure, right?"
"Of course not. Just wear the best suit you have so Ian doesn't have to be ashamed of our team."
The comment was clearly meant as friendly teasing, but it landed heavily. Jay spent the rest of the afternoon reviewing his wardrobe mentally, finding it increasingly inadequate.
That evening, Jay stood in his bedroom surveying his closet with growing dismay. His suits were well-made, but they were also clearly designed for office environments. The cuts were too formal, the overall effect too business-like for an event that apparently required sophisticated leisure wear.
He had made a fundamental error in understanding the retreat's social dynamics. This wasn't travel with recreational activities—it was social theatre with business implications.
With less than a week remaining before departure, Jay faced the uncomfortable reality that his wardrobe preparations remained incomplete. His casual resort wear would serve adequately for most activities, but the sunset dinner required something he didn't possess and couldn't acquire through normal retail channels in the time available.
He regretted not buying a lighter summer suit when there was still time. The weather forecast promised hot, sunny days that would make his winter-weight clothing uncomfortable. His new casual pieces would work fine during the day, but they were absolutely unsuitable for a prestigious evening event. 
He considered the extravagant outfit from his last shopping emergency, but the memory of the attention it drew still made his skin crawl. It had been far too flashy for his taste, and wearing it again was out of the question.
After a day of internal debate, Jay accepted that desperate times called for desperate measures. On Friday afternoon, he walked reluctantly toward Hathaway’s Menswear, the boutique where he had previously spent an unconscionable amount of money on a single outfit. That purchase had been too beautiful, too expensive, and too conspicuous for his taste. He regretted the cost every day, yet here he was again, hoping for something equally polished but less likely to draw every eye in the room.
The same sales associate recognized him immediately, greeting him warmly. This time, at least, Jay wasn’t in such a desperate hurry. He could appreciate the quality of the service.
“Good afternoon, sir. How did the earlier purchase work out for you?”
“Very well, thank you,” Jay replied, and it was true, though the success of that outfit came with complicated emotions.
“What can I help you with today?”
Jay took a breath, deciding honesty would serve him better than trying to project sophistication he didn’t possess. “I need something suitable for a very high-level evening event. But I’d prefer not to bankrupt myself in the process.”
The associate’s expression suggested he understood both requirements perfectly. “Of course, sir. Let me show you some options.”
The fitting process was far more deliberate than during Jay’s previous, frantic visit. The associate began with a round of bold runway pieces, a silk shirt missing half its buttons, trousers that clung to him like a second skin.
Jay stepped out of the fitting room, tugging at the waistband. “I think these might be… a little ambitious for me.”
The associate’s mouth twitched in what might have been amusement. “Too fashion-forward?”
“Yeah, something like that. Can we try something more conservative?”
“Of course, sir. Something more classic.”
The next selections were much closer to his comfort zone. Dress shirts with subtle textures, trousers that followed his frame without advertising it, jackets that felt structured but not stiff. The fabrics were exquisite, the cuts flattering.
When he finally stepped out in a beige sport coat over a light gray shirt and perfectly fitted trousers, the associate nodded once. “That works. Understated, but you won’t disappear in a crowd. Both the jacket and trousers are from van Haaren’s current collection, and the shirt is Mai Huysmans. Au courant choices, guaranteed to make a proper impression.”
Jay had never heard of either brand in his life, but judging from the success of his previous outfit, he could trust his word.
“This one,” he said. It was the least expensive option so far, though it still claimed a significant portion of his monthly salary. At least this time, the cost stayed below his paycheck, and the overall look felt presentable without screaming for attention.
The associate handled the transaction with the same discretion Jay remembered, arranging for minor alterations to be completed by Monday morning and ensuring every detail met his requirements.
Walking to the metro, Jay thought that his change from someone who had shopped exclusively at department stores to someone who could walk into Hathaway’s Menswear and purchase designer garments felt surreal.
The financial damage from his retreat preparations hurt. Between the weekend shopping expedition and today's purchase, he had spent the equivalent of five months' salary from his previous job. But he had also acquired a wardrobe that would allow him to participate fully in Turner & Associates' traditions without embarrassment or anxiety about his appearance.
Most importantly, Jay was satisfied with his choices. The clothes looked good, fit well, and projected exactly the image he wanted to present. He felt confident that his appearance wouldn't undermine his social integration. Whatever the retreat would demand of him, at least he'd be appropriately dressed for it. The knowledge provided some comfort, even as his bank account protested the expense.
