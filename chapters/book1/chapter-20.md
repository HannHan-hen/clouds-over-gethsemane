# Chapter 20: Milestones
## Scene 1
Thirty and debt-free
July 14th fell on a Saturday this year, and Jay woke up feeling pleased with himself. Today was his thirtieth birthday, but more importantly, it marked the achievement of a goal he'd been pursuing all year with aggressive determination.
His student loans were now paid in full as of this month. They hadn't been particularly large to begin with thanks to his choice of a local college and part-time work throughout school, but under normal circumstances, he'd have been making payments for another five years. His comfortable salary had allowed him to overpay quite dramatically, and even accounting for his clothing expenditures, his savings had grown comfortable enough to support this aggressive strategy. He'd wanted to be debt-free by his thirtieth birthday, and he'd reached that goal right on schedule.
He'd learned earlier in the year that his colleagues didn't make office birthday celebrations—apparently not everyone was comfortable with the attention. Amy had declared she no longer acknowledged birthdays after turning forty, and Ian reportedly didn't celebrate at all. The office policy was no gifts or cakes in the office to avoid awkwardness. The arrangement suited Jay perfectly, since he disliked being the center of attention anyway. Becoming debt-free was gift enough to himself.
His mother called in the morning with birthday wishes, and he could hear all his siblings chiming in with their own greetings in the background. The chaos was endearing, and Jay smiled as Ema demanded to know if he was celebrating properly in the big city.
"I'm planning a very exciting day of laundry and grocery shopping," Jay told her, which prompted immediate protests about his boring lifestyle.
He went to the gym as always. There was no reason to abandon good habits just because of a birthday.  
"Well, well. Look who's officially thirty today. Happy birthday," Rus said, consulting his tablet as Jay approached the weight station.
"Thanks. How did you—"
"Membership records. Which means today we celebrate properly," Rus grinned with mock menace.
Jay eyed him suspiciously. "What does that mean?"
"Means you get the birthday special. We're doing a full-body circuit that's going to make you question your life choices."
"That sounds more like punishment than celebration."
"Same thing, really. You'll thank me when you're in the best shape of your life." Rus loaded additional weight onto the machine. 
Jay groaned but couldn't suppress a smile. "You're enjoying this way too much."
"Absolutely. Don't think I'm going easy on you just because it's your special day."
Back at his apartment, sore but satisfied, Jay decided to experiment with some of the herbs from his mother's gift package. He'd looked up recipes that used hyssop and borage, deciding on a meat stew that promised interesting flavour combinations. The specialty herbs created an unusual aroma while cooking, not unpleasant, but definitely unfamiliar. 
On impulse, he created the social media account he'd been avoiding, adding his siblings and mother as his first connections. He photographed the finished stew alongside the herb package, captioning it "birthday experiments" before posting his first ever social media content. The process was more complicated than expected. His small kitchenette wasn't photogenic, and he had to take six attempts to create something presentable. Even then, the result looked amateurish compared to the effortless quality of Ian's office photography. Jay scrolled through those images again, feeling frustrated that the same phone camera produced such different results in Ian's hands.
"Completely unfair," he muttered to himself.
He ate the stew at his small table while browsing apartment listings on his laptop. Now that he was debt-free, there was no justification for delaying a serious real estate search. Paying the same in rent as he would for mortgage payments on a cramped studio with no elevator and inadequate air conditioning made no financial sense, regardless of how much he enjoyed the neighbourhood.
The heat made scheduling property viewings impractical, and the upcoming holiday season would mean extra work covering for vacationing colleagues, but Jay began comparing options seriously. He researched prices, read forums about different neighborhoods, and compared mortgage conditions from various banks. At thirty, he felt ready for this new chapter of his life to begin.
One-bedroom places closer to the financial district were within his budget, offering modern amenities, proper climate control and in-unit laundry, which seemed almost impossibly extravagant after years of basement laundromat visits.
He bookmarked several promising listings and made notes about questions to ask real estate agents. The process felt significant, a symbol of the stability he'd built over the past year. Twelve months ago, he'd been anxious about affording basic necessities. Now he was researching property ownership.
As evening approached, his phone buzzed with more birthday messages from extended family and a few friends from college. The attention was pleasant, and he responded to each with appreciation.
Meanwhile, across the city, Ian spent the day engaged in an internal debate that had been building for weeks. He knew Jay's birthday, had known it for months, having memorized Jay's personnel files through repeated readings. Initially, he'd reviewed the information as a precaution, looking for inconsistencies or warning signs. Lately, he returned to the files for less defensible reasons, studying the photos, or perhaps seeking insights he couldn't name.
The question of whether to acknowledge Jay's birthday had occupied his thoughts all day. He'd drafted and deleted several text messages, none of which struck the right tone. Too formal seemed cold, too casual felt inappropriate for their relationship.
He didn't send birthday wishes to other employees. There was no precedent for personal communication outside of work contexts. He couldn't justify the gesture, no matter how much he wanted to reach out.
By evening, Ian had convinced himself that staying silent was the prudent choice. They weren't close enough to warrant personal birthday acknowledgments. He told himself this restraint was appropriate. He was maintaining necessary distance, protecting both Jay's comfort and his own objectivity. Ian clung to these rationalizations as if they represented salvation, but he knew deep down they were just the remnants of defences that had been crumbling for months.
The unsent birthday message remained in his drafts folder, a small symbol of the internal conflict that had become his constant companion. Ian closed his phone and tried to focus on other matters, deliberately avoiding thinking about how Jay was spending his thirtieth birthday alone, probably content and certainly unaware of how much his happiness had come to matter to someone who was supposed to remain detached.
The shoreline of emotional safety had disappeared from Ian's view, but he continued pretending he could still see it, as if maintaining the illusion might somehow restore the equilibrium he'd already lost.
## Scene 2
A life made
Monday morning felt different as Jay prepared for work. Thirty. The number had weight that he couldn't dismiss.
A decade ago, the prospect of reaching this age without clear direction or meaningful achievement had filled him with dread. He had imagined himself struggling in dead-end positions while college friends established careers, relationships, and the markers of adult success that seemed impossibly distant from his own circumstances.
The metro ride to Northlight Financial Center felt identical to countless previous mornings, but Jay observed his reflection in the train windows with fresh perspective. The man looking back wore a perfectly tailored suit, held a beautiful leather briefcase, and looked like he belonged in the financial district's landscape.
When had that transformation occurred? The changes had been so gradual that he had never noticed their cumulative effect. Months of working alongside accomplished colleagues, handling increasingly complex responsibilities, and dressing according to standards that once seemed impossibly sophisticated had created a version of himself that would have been unrecognizable a year earlier.
Success felt less important than happiness, Jay realized as he emerged from the metro into the morning bustle of the financial district. He had indeed become successful, more so than his modest background and unremarkable credentials should have allowed, but the achievement mattered less than the simple fact that he enjoyed his daily life.
Turner & Associates' offices welcomed him with a sense of comfort. The space felt like home after so many months of extended hours, with his workstation now thoroughly personalized with items that balanced practical needs and personal preferences.
His closet contained spare clothes. The desk drawers held his neatly organized collection of office supplies—notes in a rainbow of hues, pens and highlighters for document markup, various notepads for different purposes, and his trusty notebook—now filled with information about Turner & Associates' inner workings
The kitchen area bore subtle signs of his influence as well. The fridge now stocked smoothies that matched his preferences, thanks to conversations with procurement staff. His requests had also resulted in expanded fruit selections and herb options that allowed him to create refreshing summer drinks during the heat. Small customization that made the office environment feel more personal and comfortable.
With Kim and Ela still absent on their coordinated vacation, the remaining team continued covering their responsibilities with varying degrees of grace. Amy had taken on the more complex aspects of Kim's database management while Jay handled the straightforward maintenance tasks, while Ela's client communication tasks were distributed among everyone else according to expertise and availability.
Jay had managed his expanded duties without major incidents, and he remained optimistic about maintaining that record through the remainder of their absence, even though technical troubleshooting still felt precarious despite Kim's detailed notes.
Jay had also established relationships throughout the building that extended far beyond his immediate department. He knew most employees by name, even those with whom he rarely interacted. The  receptionist greeted him warmly, the security personnel recognized him, and even the cleaning crew acknowledged him with friendly waves.
His familiarity with Turner & Associates' operations had expanded far beyond his original job description. He understood the workflows of multiple departments and administrative processes that had once seemed mysterious and intimidating.
The comfort level extended to his colleagues as well. While he wouldn't claim close friendships with most of them, Jay felt included in the office community. His relationship with Luc had developed into easy camaraderie. His connection with Ian had evolved into something more complex.
Perhaps most importantly, Jay approached each workday with enthusiasm. He woke each morning knowing that whatever challenges awaited, the day would be fundamentally good. This wasn't naive optimism but realistic confidence based on consistent positive experiences.
Around two o'clock, Ian's phone rang with an unexpected client matter. Jay could hear only Ian's side of the conversation, and the tone indicated someone requiring immediate attention.
"Conference room in half an hour," Ian announced after ending the call. "Wentworth requested an urgent consultation. Amy, I'll need your input on the emerging markets component."
Jay gathered his laptop and notebook without being asked, having learned that client meetings often generated documentation requirements that were easier to handle in real-time. He headed to the conference room and positioned himself at the side table where he could take notes without intruding on the primary conversation, his laptop ready for whatever might be required.
Client meetings no longer triggered the panic they once had, though Jay remained alert to potential complications. He had attended enough such sessions to understand the usual flow and his supporting role within the overall dynamic.
The Wentworth representatives arrived looking harried, caught in an unexpected crisis and asking for immediate guidance on their investment strategy.
Ian handled their concerns competently, explaining hedging strategies and risk management approaches with clarity that made even Jay understand the underlying principles. Amy provided technical details about emerging market trends that supported Ian's recommendations and addressed the clients' specific worries about regional instability.
Jay typed throughout the discussion, capturing details that would be crucial for follow-up actions and documentation. The conversation flowed smoothly, with Ian and Amy working in seamless coordination to address every concern the clients raised.
By the time Wentworth representatives departed an hour later, they appeared relieved about their portfolio's risk profile, the prompt consultation potentially preventing costly oversights.
Jay returned to his desk and immediately began formatting his meeting notes into a comprehensive summary for distribution. The document included action items for follow-up and key decision points that might require future reference.
He printed copies for relevant files and sent electronic versions to Ian and Amy within thirty minutes of the meeting's conclusion. The work felt automatic now, part of his standard response to client interactions that required documentation and follow-up planning.
The afternoon passed quickly as Jay caught up on tasks that had been postponed for the unexpected meeting. Email correspondence, document formatting, and administrative coordination filled the remaining hours until the office began its usual evening transition.
When eight o'clock arrived, Jay and Ian gathered their belongings. The elevator ride to the lobby, brief goodbyes as Ian continued to the garage level, and Jay's walk to the metro station—all of it felt natural.
The evening air retained the day's heat as Jay walked toward his stop. Thirty years old, established in a career that challenged and rewarded him, surrounded by colleagues who treated him with respect and appreciation—life had indeed sorted itself out.
## Scene 3
Conventional wisdom
The morning briefing on Tuesday proceeded as usual, Ian reviewing the day's priorities while Jay took notes and confirmed scheduling details. Client calls at ten and two, document reviews between meetings, correspondence that needed attention.
As they concluded their review of immediate tasks, Ian added an unexpected question.
"Are you planning to leave at five today as well?"
Jay felt heat rise in his cheeks, embarrassed that his Tuesday departure pattern had become noticeable enough to warrant comment. 
"Yes, if that's not a problem. It's my gym day."
"No problem at all. I was just curious. It's good that you're maintaining a consistent routine. Exercise habits are important."
"I do my best to take care of myself," Jay said, already edging toward his desk to escape the unexpected scrutiny.
The brief exchange left him feeling exposed. It wasn't the first time Ian had asked about his personal habits, but having his workout schedule specifically noticed made him self-conscious about his modest fitness efforts compared to Ian's obviously rigorous training regimen. Jay couldn't help but remember Ian's athletic build, and the thought left him uneasy about his own scrawny constitution.
Then he realized he was sitting at his desk thinking about his boss's physique, which created an entirely new layer of embarrassment that made him focus determinedly on his computer screen.
The rest of the day proceeded normally. The oppressive heatwave had finally broken, making the midday lunch expedition more pleasant than it had been in weeks. Without Kim's persistent advocacy for experimental cuisine, the reduced team selected a safe restaurant that offered reliable food and excellent air conditioning without culinary adventure.
When five o'clock arrived, Jay gathered his belongings, saying goodbyes to his remaining colleagues before heading home to change into his gym clothes.
His session with Rus began at six in the gym's modest facility. The trainer had become a regular fixture in Jay's routine, providing both technical guidance and casual conversation that made the workout time pass more enjoyably.
"How did your birthday go?" Rus asked as they began the warm-up.
"I don't really celebrate birthdays. Hard to organize festivities when you don't know many people in the city besides coworkers."
"That's a shame. You should consider joining some of our group fitness classes. Great way to meet fellow exercise enthusiasts."
"I'll think about it," Jay replied, though he doubted he would follow through on the suggestion.
The workout proceeded with its usual combination of challenging exercises and encouraging commentary from Rus. Jay had grown to appreciate both the physical benefits of regular training and the mental break it provided from work-related thoughts. The hour passed quickly, leaving him tired but satisfied with his effort.
By seven o'clock, he was back in his apartment, enjoying the improved air conditioning performance now that the extreme temperatures had moderated. He reheated the elaborate stew he had prepared over the weekend, and as he ate, he thought back to the morning's conversation with Ian.
The initial embarrassment had faded, replaced by what might have been pleasure that Ian paid attention to his personal habits, even if the interest stemmed from practical scheduling concerns and not from curiosity about Jay's life.
Rus's suggestion about group fitness activities returned to his thoughts as well. The trainer clearly meant well and probably had valid points about the social benefits of expanding his circle of acquaintances. But Jay didn't feel particularly lonely, and the prospect of working out with strangers held little appeal.
Ian's daily companionship, however subtle and business focused, provided an unexpected source of fulfillment. Their extended evening hours together, their morning briefings, the gradual development of both light banter and meaningful conversation—all of it created a sense of connection.
The rest of the week proceeded much as expected—long days where Jay remained in the office until eight each evening, working alongside Ian through the quieter summer schedule. Despite several colleagues' continued absence on vacation, the workload remained manageable, creating space for the leisurely evening atmosphere that had become one of Jay's favorite aspects of his routine.
Jay was making his last coffee of the day on the late Thursday afternoon, the office having emptied considerably. He lingered by the kitchen window, drawn to the view of the city stretching out below in the golden hour light. The skyline looked different at this time of day, with the harsh angles of buildings mellowed by the warm glow.
Ian appeared beside him, holding an empty cup.
"The view never gets old," Ian remarked, following Jay's gaze across the cityscape.
"I was just thinking the same thing. It's especially nice this time of day, when the light hits everything differently."
Ian prepared his coffee, then joined Jay at the window. "Did you see they're finally breaking ground on that new park project? The one where the old textile factories used to be."
Jay's face lit up with enthusiasm. "The Green Range development? I've been following that project for months. It's going to be incredible when it's finished—fifteen hectares of parkland right in the heart of the district."
"You seem invested in it."
"It's only about fifteen minutes from my apartment. I walk past the construction site regularly. They're preserving some of the original brick facade and incorporating it into the landscape design. It's going to enhance the entire neighborhood."
"I didn't realize you were so interested in urban planning." 
"I love parks. Well-designed green spaces make the city feel more livable."
Their evening conversations had become more frequent and natural, touching on everything from work observations to general commentary about the city, the weather, and the peculiarities of their industry. Jay treasured these exchanges, finding in them an intellectual companionship he had never known he wanted.
When Friday arrived and they exchanged their usual weekend farewells, Jay realized he was already looking forward to Monday's return to the office. Continuing their gradual evolution toward something that felt increasingly like friendship felt more appealing than whatever recreational activities the weekend might offer.
Saturday's gym session with Rus included a predictable follow-up about fitness opportunities.
"Have you thought any more about joining some group activities?" 
"I'm so busy with work that I barely have time for these individual sessions. Adding more would be difficult to manage."
Rus shook his head with gentle disappointment. "That's a pity. Work-life balance is important for long-term health and happiness."
Jay nodded politely but didn't share Rus's concern about his work-focused lifestyle. Time spent at Turner & Associates didn't feel like a burden that needed balancing with external activities. The work itself provided social connection and a sense of purpose.
If that meant he spent more time in Ian's company than conventional wisdom deemed healthy, Jay was content to let conventional wisdom take care of itself. Some arrangements worked better than others, and his current situation worked exceptionally well.
## Scene 4
Relationship woes
When Kim and Ela returned, they maintained the pretence while exchanging subtle glances across their desks. Nobody addressed their obvious relationship directly, but the knowing looks between other team members indicated the secret was poorly kept.
"Think they'll make it official eventually?" Jay asked Luc during their morning coffee break.
"They're trying so hard to be subtle that everyone notices more. Classic office romance mistake."
Kim was pleased to discover that nothing had gone catastrophically wrong during his absence. He reviewed the database maintenance logs Jay had kept with obvious relief, nodding approvingly.
"Everything looks perfect. No system crashes, no data corruption, no emergency calls to IT. You handled it better than I expected."
Zoe's departure for a two-week scuba diving vacation created another gap in their workforce, but her absence didn't add significantly to Jay's workload. Her responsibilities were more easily distributed among the remaining team members, unlike Kim's specialized technical duties that required dedicated coverage.
The return of Kim's adventurous palate immediately reinvigorated the lunch selection process. His relentless enthusiasm for culinary exploration had been noticeably absent during his vacation. Now the daily restaurant debates resumed with renewed intensity.
"There's a new coastal place two blocks over. They specialize in fermented flatbreads and spiced stews," Kim announced during Monday’s lunch planning.
"That sounds a bit ambitious for lunch," Max replied cautiously.
"Exactly why we should try it," Kim countered, his enthusiasm making his food advocacy both compelling and occasionally exhausting.
Jay welcomed Kim's return to form with relief. Left to his own devices, Jay invariably chose conventional options that posed no risk of disappointment or digestive adventure. Kim’s persistent pressure to expand everyone’s culinary horizons had introduced Jay to flavours and preparations he would never have discovered independently.
"I’m willing to try it," Jay said, surprising himself with his eagerness.
The restaurant was an excellent choice, with communal platters that encouraged conversation and sharing. Jay appreciated both the food itself and the way Kim’s selections consistently pushed the team toward experiences that enriched their daily life.
The first half of the week proceeded at a relaxed pace. Jay continued his extended evening hours with Ian, enjoying the productive quiet of their shared workspace after the rest of the office had emptied.
Wednesday brought an unexpected surge of activity when a major client submitted a request for additional documentation that required assembly from various sources. The project involved consolidating materials from multiple departments and formatting everything according to specific client requirements.
Jay accepted the assignment eagerly, recognizing it as a challenge that utilized his skills while providing valuable learning opportunities about the company's historical operations. The work was time-consuming but not technically complex, making it perfect for his skill level.
"I can handle this. I'm staying late anyway, and it's better if one person maintains consistency throughout the assembly process," Jay told Luc, who had been assigned the project initially.
Luc's relief was immediately apparent. "Are you sure? It's going to take at least two full evenings to complete properly."
"Absolutely. No problem at all."
Jay worked diligently for two days, gathering materials, organizing them according to the client's specifications, and ensuring that every detail met the standards. Ian reviewed the completed files, suggested minor corrections that Jay implemented immediately, and approved the final submission.
"Thanks for taking that on. I owe you a drink for saving me from two nights of extended hours." Luc said when the project was completed. "
"Don't mention it. It was actually interesting work."
"You realize you're doing analyst work for assistant pay," Max observed.
"I'm learning valuable skills."
"You're also making the rest of us look lazy."
Jay felt pleased by the acknowledgement. A year ago, such recognition would have seemed impossible.
"I can't thank you enough for covering so much this summer. My girlfriend was ready to kill me last year when I worked eighty-hour weeks during vacation season," Luc said as they prepared to leave for the day. 
"How are things with her?" Jay asked.
Luc's expression darkened slightly. "Not great, honestly. We argue constantly these days. She thinks I should be more serious about life at my age. Why is everyone so eager to be miserable?"
"What does that mean?"
"Career advancement, marriage timeline, mortgage discussions. Meanwhile, I'm perfectly content splitting a condo with three guys from college and occasionally staying out until three in the morning. Is that really so selfish?"
"I don't think wanting to be ready for major decisions is selfish," Jay replied carefully, without offering solutions he didn't possess. His own romantic experience was woefully limited.
"She says I'm wasting my potential. I say I'm enjoying my youth while I still have it. What about you? Anyone pressuring you to settle down and become respectable?"
"Career takes precedence right now."
Luc raised an eyebrow. "That's interesting, considering you turned down Ian's promotion offer. Advancement doesn't seem like your top priority."
"It's complicated."
Jay deflected further questions, but the conversation stayed with him. His motivations had changed over the past year. The prestigious job he'd initially wanted for security had become something deeper—a sense of belonging he'd never experienced before.
Amy departed for her own vacation on Friday, creating a bigger gap in their workforce. With both Zoe and Amy absent, the remaining team members faced increased workloads that ended the leisurely evening atmosphere Jay had grown to appreciate.
"No more relaxed evenings for a while. Everyone will need to cover additional responsibilities until people start returning," Ian observed as they reviewed the week's accomplishments.
Jay nodded, already mentally adjusting his expectations for the coming weeks. The extended hours would continue, but they would be filled with pressing tasks instead of the comfortable discretionary projects and casual conversations.
The coming weeks would test everyone's adaptability as they managed reduced staffing levels and maintained service quality for clients who expected consistent excellence regardless of summer schedules. But Jay felt confident about the challenges ahead, knowing that his role had evolved to the point where he could contribute meaningfully.
## Scene 5
One year
The calendar's progression to August held unusual weight this year, marking not just another month but a complete revolution around the change that had remade Jay's daily existence. One full year at Turner & Associates—a milestone that would have seemed impossible to reach during those first terrifying weeks when every task felt like a potential catastrophe.
Ian called Jay into his office for what he described as an annual review, scheduled for Thursday morning in his office with the door closed.
"Please, sit down," Ian said, gesturing toward the chairs arranged across from his desk. The formal setup felt almost ceremonial after so many months of casual interaction.
"You've been here a full year now," Ian said, consulting a folder that probably contained Jay's employment records. "Your performance has been exemplary."
"Thank you," Jay said, uncertain about the tone Ian was trying to establish.
"You've expanded your responsibilities far beyond the original role description, demonstrated reliability during crisis periods, and integrated seamlessly into our team dynamic. Which brings me to my previous offer. You're clearly capable of handling regular analyst duties. The position I mentioned six months ago is still available if you're interested."
Jay didn't hesitate. "I'd rather stay where I am."
"You're sure? It would mean better advancement opportunities, more varied work."
"I'm happy in my current role."
Ian nodded slowly. "Then we'll leave things as they are."
The moment felt charged, but Jay couldn't decode the undercurrent of tension in Ian's demeanour.
"Actually," Ian continued, reaching into his desk drawer and producing a rectangular box. "I have something for you."
"What's this?"
"One-year anniversary gift."
Jay accepted the box sceptically. "I've never heard of one-year anniversaries warranting gifts."
"No other assistant has lasted this long. I've had a dozen in my career, so that means something."
Jay opened the box. Inside, nestled in silk lining, was a watch. Even his untrained eye could recognize its quality—the leather band was soft, the face elegant, every detail speaking of craftsmanship and expense.
"It's also compensation for the circumstances of your hiring. And for your thirtieth birthday."
Jay stared at it, uncertain how to respond.
"Jay." Ian's voice had gone quiet, almost hesitant. "It's also an apology."
"For what?"
"During your first year, you were wronged repeatedly, and I never properly acknowledged my role in that. I was distant when you needed guidance. I rebuffed your questions when you were trying to learn. I allowed office gossip to affect you. I didn't prepare you adequately for company events. I didn't protect you from harassment at the gala. These were failures of leadership on my part. A watch isn't adequate compensation for those slights, but it's a token of my sincerity."
Jay felt heat climb his neck. "None of those were your fault."
"They were my responsibility. You deserved better mentorship from the beginning. I can't undo the times I was colder than necessary, or the moments when my caution probably seemed like rejection. But I want you to know that those failings were mine, not yours. You have been exemplary from day one, and I should have made that clear much sooner."
The intensity in Ian's voice made Jay uncomfortable. He fumbled for a response that might deflect the weight of the moment.
Ian seemed to recognize his discomfort. "Besides," he added with forced lightness, "Leo paid for it. He's mostly to blame for everything that went wrong, so you can accept it without feeling burdened."
Jay managed a weak smile. "In that case."
He returned to his desk with the watch box. A quick internet search revealed the price was roughly half his annual salary. A year ago, that sum would have been incomprehensible. Now he thought it would complement his midnight blue suit nicely.
He fastened the watch around his wrist, studying how it looked against his sleeve. It was heavier than Jay expected. Like everything else in his new life, it fit perfectly.
His eyes moved to the leather messenger bag Leo had given him during his first week. It sat beside his desk, still pristine despite daily use, testament to quality craftsmanship. Back then, it had been his only possession that belonged in this environment. Now everything about him matched the setting.
He looked toward Ian's office, where his boss was reviewing documents. There was no other place he would rather be than here, no other role he would rather fill than supporting Ian's work.
Jay touched the watch lightly with his other hand, unsure about the true significance of Ian’s gift but certain it ran deeper than Ian's explanation. It felt monumental somehow, and Jay resolved that he would never take it off.
He realized that he had never been happier in his life. Not just content with his career or financially secure. He felt true happiness that encompassed his entire existence. Turner & Associates had given him stability, his colleagues had provided friendship, and Ian had offered something more precious that Jay was only beginning to understand. The bond between them felt real, and words seemed insufficient to describe what was actually happening.
That evening, Ian sat in his living room with his head in his hands, replaying the afternoon's conversation. Jay's immediate refusal to transfer, the relief that had flooded through him at that response. The careful words of his apology had barely contained the deeper truth he couldn't acknowledge.
He was in love with Jay Hall. Had been for months, probably. The realization wasn't sudden—it had been building gradually. But watching Jay's face as he opened the gift, seeing the surprise and confusion in his expression, the way his beautiful eyes looked at him, Ian could no longer pretend his feelings were merely protective or appreciative.
The admiration in Jay's eyes was pure, innocent, completely without awareness of Ian as anything more than a mentor. Jay didn't see him as a man at all—just as an authority figure worthy of respect and gratitude.
And that meant Ian was in love, hopelessly and completely, with someone he could never have. But knowing it was impossible didn't change the reality of what he felt. It only made the daily proximity more challenging.
