# Chapter 1: Things set in motion

## Scene 1: The gift

The thirty-second floor of the Northlight Financial Center housed Turner & Associates, where windows offered an unobstructed view of the city's financial district. Ian Hagen sat behind his desk, reviewing reports with the attention that had earned him his reputation. Numbers never lied, never schemed, never betrayed trust for personal gain.

"Ian. Perfect timing." Leo Turner interrupted his concentration.

Ian looked up to find his friend standing in the doorway, wearing an expression that Ian had learned to distrust over the years.

"What have you done now?"

Leo stepped into the office and closed the door behind him. "I've found you an assistant. Again."

"I don't need an assistant."

"You said that about the last three."

"The last three were your poorly disguised attempts at matchmaking. Though I admit Luc turned out surprisingly competent."

"Jay Hall has a decent economics degree from some local university, worked for three years at a forgettable mid-tier firm. His qualifications are thoroughly unremarkable, but he's got gray eyes, pale skin, and looks like he'd apologize for breathing too loudly. Exactly your type."

"You're never going to stop punishing me for the Connelly incident, are you?"

"This isn't punishment. This is therapy. You work sixteen-hour days, handle correspondence that should be delegated, and haven't had a proper conversation with an attractive man in months. Jay Hall could be good for you."

"Or he could be another corporate spy looking to pilfer our client list."

"Ian. That was thirteen years ago. Sam Connelly was a hired operative. The chances of lightning striking twice—"

"Are higher than you think in our line of work." Ian got up and walked to the window. The city sprawled beneath them, filled with ambitious people willing to exploit any advantage. "You know what the tabloids called me after that story broke? The billionaire's lovesick son. My own father couldn't look at me."

"Your father is an ass who cares more about appearances than his son's well-being."

"He wasn't wrong to be furious. I handed over strategic information to a competitor because I was infatuated with a beautiful man. I cost the family company millions in lost deals."

"You fell in love with someone who turned out to be lying about who he was. The fact that Sam walked away when he did, that he never used most of what he learned, that he tried to minimize the damage—"

"Doesn't change the fact that I was completely blind to what was happening."

"You were twenty-five years old and in love. Of course you were blind. But you weren't stupid, Ian. Sam Connelly was a spy. He was trained to be charming, to find vulnerabilities, to make people trust him. You had no reason to suspect—"

"I had every reason to be more careful."

"Oh absolutely, you should have been paranoid about every attractive man who crossed your path. Really, what were you thinking, trusting someone? Look where that reckless optimism got you—fired from the family company, disowned by your father, splashed across every tabloid in the city, financially ruined, and blacklisted in your field. Lucky for you, you had a friend willing to fight his own father to give you a second chance."

"Your father made his feelings about that decision very clear for the first year."

"My father is also the one who doubled your salary after you saved the deal with Anderson. And again after you restructured Merrick Investments. And again last quarter when you—"

"I understand your point."

"Do you? Because sometimes I think you still see yourself as that naive twenty-five-year-old who got taken in by a pretty face. You're not that person anymore, Ian. You're one of the most successful financial minds in the city. You've earned the right to trust your own judgment."

Ian already felt the weight of resignation. Leo had saved him once, completely and without question. The least he could do was humor his friend's schemes, however misguided they might be.

"When does he start?"

"Monday morning. Nine o'clock sharp."

"And if this turns into another disaster?"

"Then I'll be there to pick you up and dust you off again, just like I did thirteen years ago. Though I have a feeling the only disaster will be you discovering that sometimes a boring accountant is just a boring accountant."

Ian already knew he would regret this decision. "Monday morning. Nine o'clock sharp."

"Thank you. Jay Hall is a good man who needs a job. You're a good man who needs help. I'm hoping you'll both benefit from the arrangement."

"You're enjoying this."

"I'm hoping for this. Sam Connelly broke your heart, but he also gave you the best eight months of your life. You told me so yourself."

"Before I knew what he was."

"He was a man doing a job he probably hated, who fell for someone he was supposed to betray. The fact that he walked away instead of following through with his assignment speaks volumes about his character."

After Leo left, Ian returned to his reports, but the numbers seemed to blur together on the page. The conversation had stirred up memories he preferred to keep buried—not just of Sam Connelly's betrayal, but of the tender mornings they had shared, the warmth that had seemed so real at the time.

The scandal had been devastating. "Billionaire Heir's Love Nest Exposed" had been splashed across tabloids for weeks, complete with photos of Ian and Sam leaving restaurants, attending theater performances, living what Ian had thought was a private life. His father's fury had been absolute, not just at the security breach, but at Ian's public humiliation of the family name.

The firing had been swift, the disownment even swifter. Ian became suddenly unemployed, publicly shamed, and effectively homeless within a matter of days. Leo's intervention had been his salvation, though even that had come at a cost. The elder Turner had made his displeasure clear, questioning Leo's judgment in hiring a liability and making Ian's first year at the firm a careful dance of proving his worth while avoiding any hint of impropriety.

But Ian had proven himself, quarter after quarter of exceptional results. He had earned his place here through competence and dedication, building walls around himself that no Sam Connelly could breach again.

Now Leo wanted to test those walls again.

Ian pushed away thoughts of Monday morning and the man who would soon occupy the desk outside his office. The numbers on the page demanded his attention, and numbers, at least, were something he could trust.

## Scene 2: Arrival

The following Monday morning, Jay Hall arrived at the gleaming chrome-and-glass entrance of Northlight Financial Center a full twenty minutes early. He'd picked out his suit days ago, the best one he owned, a sober grey that still felt a little stiff. Even though it was already in perfect condition, he still spent half an hour inspecting every detail, and another fifteen minutes trying to force his black hair into something resembling style. He clutched his satchel, his heart thumping a nervous but excited rhythm against his ribs. This was it. A real chance.

He announced himself to the receptionist, a poised woman who gave him a polite, appraising smile before directing him to a comfortable waiting area. Jay sat on the edge of an expensive leather armchair, trying not to look as awestruck as he felt by the opulence of the lobby.

A few minutes later, a door opened and Leo Turner emerged, as confident and easy-going as ever. He was dressed impeccably, but with more flair than the others in the office—a patterned shirt, no tie, and a smile that managed to be both welcoming and shrewd.

"Jay Hall! Right on time. No, a bit early, even better! Enthusiasm, I like it." Leo extended a hand, offering a firm handshake. "Welcome to the company."

Jay scrambled to his feet, nearly dropping his satchel. "Mr. Turner, thank you. It's an honour to be here. Really." His voice was a little breathier than he intended, but his smile was sincere. He hoped he wasn't coming across as too desperate, but frankly, he was desperate—for a good, stable, uncomplicated job.

"Please, call me Leo. We're not overly formal here… well, some of us aren't." Leo winked, a quick, conspiratorial gesture that Jay didn't quite know how to interpret, so he just nodded. "Come on, let me show you around the immediate vicinity, get you set up."

Leo led him through a section of the open-plan office. It was already buzzing with activity, people focused on screens, murmuring into headsets. Everyone looked sharp and driven. Jay felt a fresh wave of intimidation, but also a thrill.

"Your primary role, as we discussed, will be supporting Ian Hagen, our CFO," Leo said, his voice dropping slightly as they approached a more secluded corridor lined with offices that had actual doors. "He's… well, he's Ian. Brilliant, demanding, expects the best. But I have a good feeling about this. A very good feeling." Leo gave Jay a pointed look.

Jay's heart gave a little leap at the mention of Ian. Demanding, expects the best. That sounded like someone who wouldn't have time for nonsense.

"I've heard he's an exceptional manager, sir— Leo," Jay corrected himself quickly, flushing a little. "I'm really looking forward to learning from him. I'll do my absolute best not to disappoint." The earnestness in his voice was palpable. He truly meant it. This was his sanctuary.

"Oh, I don't think disappoint will be the word, Jay. Not at all." Leo stopped outside a closed door. "This will be Ian's den. He's in a meeting right now, but you'll meet him later. Your workstation is just here." He indicated a neat, well-equipped desk in a small alcove just outside Ian's office, shared with one other, currently empty, assistant's desk. "You'll be handling a lot of his reports, due diligence groundwork, keeping his schedule from imploding, the fun stuff. Back-office heroics, basically."

"It sounds great," Jay breathed, his eyes shining as he took in the desk, the powerful computer, the view of the city skyline from a nearby window. The salary was more than he'd ever earned, the company was prestigious, and his boss was famously, wonderfully cynical about workplace flirtations. He couldn't have engineered a better situation if he'd tried.

"Glad you think so," Leo said, his eyes crinkling at the corners with amusement. He clapped Jay on the shoulder. "Alright, HR will be by in a bit with the mountain of paperwork. Get comfortable, get your logins. And Jay?"

"Yes?"

"Just be yourself. I have a feeling that's exactly what Ian needs." Leo's smile was positively beaming now, like a cat that had not only gotten the cream but had also figured out how to open the entire dairy.

Jay nodded fervently, completely missing the undercurrent. "I will. Thank you again, Leo. For everything."

Leo gave a final, cheerful wave and headed back towards his own office. Oh, this was going to be fun. Young, pretty, and so transparently eager. Ian wouldn't know what hit him.

As Leo left, Jay sank into his new ergonomic chair, a wave of profound relief washing over him, so potent it almost made him dizzy. His last job, at a mid-tier consulting firm, had been… adequate. The work itself was fine, even a little challenging at times, but then a senior analyst with clammy hands and a predatory gleam in his eye had started finding excuses to mentor him a little too closely. The lingering touches, the private chats that veered into uncomfortable territory, it had all escalated with terrifying speed, forcing Jay into a frantic job search. He'd almost exclusively targeted companies with strong HR reputations, but then he'd stumbled upon a rather gossipy thread on-line mentioning Ian Hagen. The man was a legend, not just for his financial acumen, but for being openly, unapologetically gay, and, crucially, for the almost mythical stories of his icy dismissal of anyone who dared try to use their charms to get ahead with him. Apparently, some past drama had made him utterly immune, even hostile, to such advances. It sounded like a fortress.

Jay had sent in his application to Turner & Associates on a wing and a prayer, never imagining he'd even get a call back for such a prestigious firm, let alone an interview with the owner's son. When the job offer came, it felt like winning the lottery. He was going to pour every ounce of his being into this role, be the most diligent and unobtrusive assistant Ian Hagen had ever seen. He would make himself indispensable, and invisible in any way that wasn't purely about the work.

## Scene 3: Introduction

The desk outside Ian's office had been empty for almost a year, serving mainly as a repository for files that needed his attention. Now it held a young man with the features Leo had described and an air of concentration as he worked through employment forms.

Ian paused in his office doorway, observing. Jay Hall looked younger than his twenty-nine years, dressed in a plain suit that gave the impression of attention to appropriateness. His posture spoke of effort—a man trying hard to make a good impression, shoulders straight but tense, pen gripped as if determined not to make mistakes.

Everything about the scene felt calculated to appeal to Ian's protective instincts. It was exactly what someone might do if they wanted to present themselves as harmless, eager, in need of guidance.

Ian stepped out of his office.

Jay looked up immediately, and Ian caught the brief moment of assessment in those large gray eyes before the younger man scrambled to his feet. The movement was awkward, his hip bumping against the desk edge, papers scattering slightly.

"Mr. Hagen. I'm Jay Hall. Thank you so much for this opportunity. I've reviewed the preliminary materials Leo provided, and I'm eager to contribute to the team's success."

The words came out as if Jay had rehearsed them multiple times. Which he probably had.

"Welcome to Turner & Associates. I trust HR has provided everything you need for the initial paperwork?"

"Yes, sir. Almost finished." Jay gestured toward the forms, then seemed to realize the gesture was unnecessary and let his hand drop. "I arrived early to make sure everything was in order."

Of course he had. Ian wondered if that eagerness was authentic or another constructed element of Jay's appeal. Sam Connelly had been punctual too, always arriving before Ian, staying late to ensure projects were completed perfectly.

"I'll introduce you to the rest of the department." Ian moved toward the open workspace visible through the glass partition. "Your primary responsibilities will involve managing my calendar, handling correspondence, and providing analytical support for client reports."

Jay followed, and Ian was acutely aware of the younger man behind him, not presumptuous or invasive, but clearly attentive.

The main floor housed twelve desks arranged to promote both collaboration and focus, but only half were occupied, their inhabitants already deep in the day's work. The others sat empty, with dark monitors and pushed in chairs.

"Amy Evans, our senior analyst." Ian stopped beside a dark haired woman in her forties who looked up with a welcoming smile. "Amy, this is Jay Hall, my new assistant."

"Finally." Amy stood to shake Jay's hand. "Ian's been drowning in administrative work for months. Welcome aboard."

"Thank you. I look forward to working with everyone."

They moved through the introductions. "Luc Webb, our junior associate," Ian moved to a handsome man with neat black hair who looked up with a cheerful smile. "Luc started as my assistant two years ago and worked his way up fast." Luc's greeting was confident as he shook hands.

"Ela Rodriguez handles our international accounts." Ian gestured to an impeccably dressed woman whose tailored jacket made her look like she'd stepped straight from a boardroom. Her handshake was firm, her smile amiable.

"Zoe Jones manages our portfolio risk assessments," Ian continued, approaching a petite blonde woman who glanced up briefly from her screen. Her "Nice to meet you" was accompanied by a shy smile before she turned her attention back to her work.

"And Kim Thompson, our technology specialist." The last introduction was to a man in jeans and a sweater, the relaxed attire standing out among the more formally dressed team. Kim's grin was unpretentious as he waved from his desk.

Each greeting was proper and friendly. And that, Ian realized, was what bothered him most. Jay's responses were appropriate and completely normal. There was nothing that raised obvious red flags. Just a quiet young man who seemed interested in the work.

It was exactly what someone would do if they were very good at deception.

"Questions so far?" Ian asked as they returned to Jay's desk.

"Nothing immediate. The department structure is clear, and everyone seems very capable." Jay hesitated, then added, "I know my qualifications aren't exceptional, Mr. Hagen. I want you to know I'm committed to exceeding your expectations."

The admission was delivered without self-pity or false modesty, just a straightforward acknowledgement of reality. Ian was moved by the honesty, then immediately suspicious of that reaction. Sam had been honest too, in his way. Honest about his background, his education. It was only his identity and motivations that had been lies.

"Competence matters more than credentials," Ian said, which was true enough. "I'll expect your best effort, nothing more or less."

"You'll have it."

Ian returned to his office, leaving Jay to finish his paperwork. Through his glass door, he could observe the younger man's movements. When Jay reached for his phone to answer what was likely his first call, his posture straightened and his voice was clear enough for Ian to hear the greeting.

Everything about Jay Hall appeared authentic. Which was exactly what made Ian most suspicious.

For his part, Jay felt as if he had stumbled into a dream. The office was everything he had imagined when Leo Turner had called with the offer—sleek, sophisticated, populated by people who clearly took their work seriously. And Ian Hagen was exactly what Jay had hoped for in a superior. Formal without being dismissive or condescending. The way Ian handled introductions made it clear he cared about his staff's integration and didn't simply dump new hires into the workplace without support.

Jay had been prepared for arrogance, for casual cruelty that successful men sometimes displayed toward those they perceived as beneath them. Instead, Ian had treated him with courtesy, explaining duties without talking down to him, introducing him as a colleague and not simply "the help."

There was no denying the man's magnetism. Tall, blonde and impeccably dressed, with refined features that belonged in boardrooms and exclusive restaurants. But there was something else, a quality Jay couldn't quite identify. A watchfulness, as if he was always assessing the room.

Whatever it was, it made Jay more determined to prove himself worthy of this opportunity. He had been honest about his modest qualifications, but he hadn't mentioned his hunger for something better than the dead-end position he had left behind, or his excitement at the chance to work somewhere that mattered.

This was his opportunity to build something meaningful, to work alongside people who were truly accomplished. He wouldn't waste it.

As he completed the final form and reached for his phone to handle his first official call, Jay caught sight of Ian through the glass office door. The older man was reviewing documents with the same attention Jay had observed during their brief interaction.

This was going to work out perfectly.

Jay spent the rest of his first day drowning in manuals, company policies and client protocols. Ian had provided him with a stack of materials thick enough to serve as a doorstop and a brief explanation of procedures before disappearing back into his office. Not long after, Kim appeared with his new equipment: a laptop, tablet and phone so high-end and pristine they belonged in a different league from anything he'd owned before, all already set up and ready to use, along with login credentials for various systems.

The work itself was straightforward enough. What overwhelmed Jay was everything else. The office building's amenities read like an exclusive hotel brochure. The kitchen and lounge area near their department featured a gleaming espresso machine that looked unnecessarily complex, a refrigerator stocked with organic beverages he'd only seen in upscale grocery stores, and an endless supply of artisanal snacks arranged in glass containers.

Jay had grown up in a town where the fanciest coffee came from a gas station, where office break rooms meant a table with a coffee pot if you were lucky. The idea of unlimited premium refreshments available to employees seemed almost wasteful, though he was careful not to take more than seemed appropriate.

He was hyper-aware of his clothing and his speech patterns. Everyone else moved through the space with confidence, helping themselves to imported sparkling water and gourmet cookies as if such sumptuousness was perfectly ordinary.

In the afternoon Jay kept browsing endless orientation materials and system tutorials. He absorbed everything, taking notes in his neat handwriting. When five o'clock arrived, he was still deep in documentation, barely aware of the time.

"Jay. Time to go home," Ian said from his office doorway.

Jay looked up, startled. "I'm still working through the materials. I can stay—"

"No. I don't encourage overtime for administrative tasks. Leave the enthusiasm to them." Ian gestured toward the main workspace, where several associates were still hunched over their computers. "Regular hours, consistent performance."

Jay gathered his belongings, feeling mildly dismissed but appreciating the clear communication. The ride home on public transit gave him time to process the day, and it wasn't until he was unlocking his apartment door that he realized he'd been too excited to eat lunch.

His stomach growled as he dropped his bag by the door, but Jay first removed his suit jacket and hung it properly in the closet, then changed his shirt and trousers for loose sweatpants and an old t-shirt. Only then did he head for the kitchen. He pulled out the sandwich he'd packed that morning and unwrapped it while reheating leftovers from the night before. The combination was hardly gourmet, but he was too hungry to care.

As he ate, Jay's mind kept returning to Ian Hagen. He was so handsome that it seemed almost unfair—like he had stepped out of a period drama where everyone spoke in perfect sentences and walked with innate grace. His posture was flawless, his manner of speaking inspiring. Even his hands were remarkable, appearing simultaneously strong and elegant. Jay had never met anyone who seemed so perfectly put together in every conceivable way.

The office itself had been impressive enough—the sweeping views, the expensive furniture, the sense of operating at the highest levels of finance. But Ian elevated it all. Jay could imagine learning enormous amounts just by observing how he conducted meetings, how he analyzed problems, how he made decisions.

This was exactly the opportunity Jay had dreamed of when he moved to the city. A chance to work alongside someone truly exceptional. The thought filled him with renewed determination.

After finishing his makeshift dinner, Jay spread the orientation materials across his small dining table. He read through employee handbooks, organizational charts, and client overview documents until the sun had set completely. Every detail mattered. He wanted to arrive tomorrow armed with knowledge.

By nine o'clock, his eyes were starting to strain. Jay closed the folders and headed for the shower, letting the hot water wash away the day's nervousness.

Afterwards he laid out his suit and inspected every detail. A small thread hung loose from one button, which he trimmed with scissors. He picked a fresh shirt that looked crisp enough, but he ran the iron over the collar anyway, making sure the points lay perfectly flat. His tie received the same treatment, draped over the closet door.

First impressions mattered, but second impressions mattered too.

By eleven, Jay was in bed with his alarm set for six-thirty. Plenty of time to arrive early and establish himself as reliable.

## Scene 4: Settling in

The next morning, Jay arrived at eight o'clock to find Ian already at his desk, coffee in hand, reviewing overnight market reports. Jay hesitated outside his own workspace, uncertain whether he should interrupt. The older man looked completely absorbed in his work, and Jay had no idea what the appropriate protocol might be for morning greetings.

He sat behind his desk and tried to look busy organizing papers that were already perfectly organized. Ten minutes later, Ian emerged from his office with a stack of files.

"Good morning, Mr. Hagen." Jay stood immediately, perhaps too quickly.

"Ian." The correction was mild but definite. "Everyone here uses first names. We're colleagues, not a nineteenth-century law firm."

"Ian." Jay tested the name, as if it might break. "Good morning."

"Good morning. These are client profiles for this week's meetings. I'll need summaries of their current portfolio positions by Thursday." Ian handed over the files.

"Of course. Is there a particular format you prefer?"

"The templates are in the shared folder. Ask Luc if you have questions about the system."

After Ian returned to his office, Jay made his way to the kitchen area, hoping to figure out the espresso machine without embarrassing himself. The device looked like it belonged on a spaceship.

"First time with the beast?" Luc appeared beside him, coffee mug in hand. He was perhaps a few years older than Jay, with a friendly smile and a relaxed demeanour.

"Is it that obvious?"

"You're staring at it like it might bite." Luc reached past him to access the machine's controls. "Here, watch. Grind setting depends on what you want. This button for milk steaming if you're feeling fancy."

Jay watched as Luc demonstrated each step, expecting an impatient instruction he'd received at previous jobs when asking for help. Instead, Luc took care to explain each function, even showing Jay where the cleaning supplies were kept.

"Thanks. I appreciate the patience."

"No problem. We've all been the new person." Luc prepared his own coffee with ease. "Fair warning—Ian's particular about his coffee. Single origin, no sugar, no milk. He's got his own supply in his office, but if you ever need to make him one, the good beans are in the sealed container on the top shelf."

Jay filed away this information along with everything else he was learning about his new workplace. The coffee he eventually produced was better than anything he'd ever made for himself, rich and complex, justifying the expensive equipment.

Back at his desk with his perfect coffee and the stack of client files, Jay felt a surge of contentment. This was exactly what he'd hoped for—meaningful work, capable colleagues, an environment where competence was valued and supported. He opened the first file and began reading, determined to prove himself worthy of the opportunity.

From his office, Ian observed Jay's movements, the way the younger man handled the client files with reverence, the attention he gave to each document. The enthusiasm was unmistakable. Jay approached even simple tasks as if they were important work.

It was exactly the behaviour that had charmed Ian thirteen years ago. Sam Connelly had shown the same eagerness, the same gratitude for opportunities. The way Jay had looked at him that morning—like Christmas had arrived early—was particularly unsettling. That combination of respect and personal interest that could as well be innocent or entirely calculated.

Ian returned to his market reports, pushing away the comparison. Jay Hall was not Sam Connelly, and Ian was not the naive twenty-five-year-old who had fallen for a beautiful face and a hard luck story. He was a successful executive with the wisdom to keep himself safe while giving new employees fair opportunities to establish themselves.

Whether Jay's enthusiasm was real or performed would become clear soon enough. Until then, Ian would remain perfectly amiable. And completely guarded.

The next day, Jay arrived at the office twenty minutes early. The elevator ride felt less intimidating than Monday's first ascent, though his stomach still fluttered when the doors opened to reveal Turner & Associates' marble lobby.

The receptionist offered him a friendly smile as he passed, and Jay said a quiet "Good morning" in return. His desk appeared exactly as he'd left it on Tuesday—organized and equipped with the sleek laptop that still felt too expensive for his hands.

Ian's office door were closed, but Jay could see the faint glow of his computer screen through the glass. According to the calendar, Ian had an early morning call with overseas investors, which meant Jay had time to review his client summaries one final time before the morning rush began.

He opened the three files he'd been studying religiously since yesterday. Each summary represented hours of research, both at the office and at home the previous evening, where he'd spent additional time reading client details and learning about their industries. Jay had written and rewritten each summary twice, using the templates Ian had provided and matching the formal tone he'd observed in similar documents.

"Morning, Jay. How's the crash course going?" Luc dropped into the chair beside his desk.

"I think I'm managing. Still learning everyone's preferred formats," Jay replied, closing the file.

"Ian's particular about structure, but he's fair. If you put in the effort, he'll recognize it. He's been buried in the Tokyo deal since six this morning. Don't worry, he doesn't expect you to match those hours. Ian just does that sometimes for international calls," Luc said, glancing toward the closed office door.

Jay nodded. He'd memorized Ian's morning schedule, with the back-to-back calls that would keep him occupied until well past noon. The afternoon held two internal meetings, leaving little time for Jay to present his completed summaries.

Kim Thompson materialized at Jay's desk with a stack of papers. "Morning entertainment," he announced, setting down expense reports. "Ian needs these digitized and categorized by Friday. Welcome to the glamorous world of high finance."

"Thanks," Jay said, accepting the task without complaint. The work looked tedious but straightforward, an assignment he could handle without fear of making costly mistakes.

"Don't look so thrilled," Kim said dryly. "At least it's not Leo's receipts."

Jay attempted a smile, still uncertain about the office's tolerance for humour.

Jay drafted a schedule. Client summaries occupied his morning priority slot, expense reports filled after Ian's meetings and calendar maintenance happened after lunch. Leo Turner's arrival disrupted his plan.

"Jay, my friend." Leo appeared beside his desk, holding an elegant leather messenger bag. "I have a gift."

Jay looked up from his computer screen, automatically saving his work. "Mr. Turner—" He caught himself. "Leo. Good morning."

"Office equipment upgrade," Leo said, placing the bag on Jay's desk. "Standard issue for all our assistants."

The messenger bag was beautiful—supple brown leather with brass fittings, clearly expensive. Jay examined the craftsmanship, the multiple compartments and padding designed specifically for electronics. His current laptop bag, purchased during his university years, bore multiple patches and a broken zipper.

"Thank you. This will be very useful."

"Image matters in this business. Our clients expect a certain level of presentation."

Jay slipped his laptop into the new bag, testing how well it fit and marvelling that everything seemed to slot in perfectly. The construction was flawless, clearly built to last decades. The leather smelled rich and new, a marked contrast to the synthetic materials he was accustomed to using.

"I should let you get back to work. Ian mentioned you're handling some client summaries. Important first assignment."

"I'm planning to have them ready by tomorrow morning. Assuming I can find time to finalize the formatting."

"Take your time. Better to deliver quality than speed."

As Leo disappeared toward the elevators, Jay set the laptop back on his desk and glanced at the new leather bag beside it. The equipment here was another level entirely, and he could take the sleek laptop home if needed. For a moment, he just took in the setup, all of it feeling a little unreal. It formed a cohesive set, all expensive, all representing standards he was still learning to accept.

His phone buzzed with a calendar reminder—Ian's call would end in fifteen minutes, followed by a brief window before the next meeting. Jay opened his client summaries, reviewing the final drafts one more time.

Twenty minutes later, the office door opened. Ian emerged, straightening his tie, and approached Jay's desk.

"Good morning, Jay. How are the summaries progressing?"

"Nearly complete," Jay replied, minimizing the document window. "I should have them ready for your review by this afternoon."

"Excellent. When you have a moment, I have another task." Ian placed a folder on Jay's desk. "These are draft documents for a new client proposal. I need them proofread for accuracy and consistency. Nothing urgent—Friday afternoon will be sufficient."

"Of course. I'll add it to my schedule."

"Thank you. How are you finding the pace here?"

"Manageable. I'm still learning the systems, but I think I'm adapting well."

Ian nodded once, a brief acknowledgement that seemed to conclude their interaction. He returned to his office, leaving Jay to contemplate the growing collection of responsibilities accumulating on his desk.

At two-thirty, just as Jay had allocated time to review his summaries one final time, Ian's phone rang with an unexpected call from a client. The conversation stretched past three o'clock, with Ian's door remaining firmly closed throughout. Jay watched his schedule dissolve as the afternoon meetings moved to next week.

When Ian finally emerged, Jay realized the summary discussion would have to wait until Thursday. He was beginning to understand that his role would involve constant adaptation to changing priorities instead of the predictable patterns he preferred. The realization felt daunting, but he told himself that flexibility was simply another skill he would need to develop if he wanted to succeed at Turner & Associates.

## Scene 5: Signals

By Friday afternoon, Jay had completed his first week at Turner & Associates with a great success. Ian had assigned him progressively more complex tasks throughout the week, chosen less for their urgency than for their value in getting Jay acquainted with the work and the standards expected. Each assignment came with clear instructions and constructive feedback when Jay returned the completed work. Ian's corrections were delivered without condescension, his suggestions practical and not critical. When Jay had initially misunderstood the format for meeting summaries, Ian had simply provided a better example and asked him to revise accordingly.

"This client prefers detailed risk assessments," Ian had explained Thursday morning, reviewing Jay's report. "They're conservative investors who want to understand every variable. This section needs expansion."

Jay had taken notes eagerly, appreciating guidance that treated him as capable of improvement. His previous job had involved a supervisor who seemed to take personal pleasure in highlighting mistakes, often in front of other employees. Ian's approach was in a league far above anything he'd experienced before.

After a week of learning the ropes, Ian gave him access to his email and calendar, then sat down with him for a detailed briefing on how they should be managed. He handed Jay a printed set of general rules, guidelines for prioritizing messages, handling meeting requests, and flagging anything urgent. For now, Jay would simply observe how Ian managed these himself, but once he understood the requirements, overseeing Ian's email and calendar would become one of his key responsibilities.

The work itself was more engaging than anything Jay had done before. Instead of processing invoices for an accounting firm that served local businesses, he was now supporting investment decisions that involved millions and international markets. Even the simplest tasks felt important when they contributed to something larger than himself.

What made the week perfect, however, was the complete absence of unwanted attention. Jay had spent his last weeks at his previous job avoiding his senior's colleague advances. The relief of working with people who presented no obvious red flags was almost overwhelming.

Ian treated him exactly as Jay had always hoped to be treated in a workplace—with respect and zero personal interest. Their interactions were courteous but formal, focused entirely on work objectives. When Ian needed to review documents at Jay's desk, he maintained physical distance. When Jay had questions, Ian answered them without turning them into unnecessary conversation.

It was paradise. Jay knew his enthusiasm was probably obvious, but he couldn't bring himself to care.

Ian, observing Jay's barely concealed delight with every mundane task, felt his suspicions crystallize into near certainty. The younger man's performance was competent enough, but it was his obvious pleasure in their interactions that raised the alarm.

Jay's face lit up whenever Ian approached his desk. He absorbed feedback as if he was memorizing scripture. Most tellingly, he seemed to find excuses to extend their interactions, asking follow-up questions that weren't strictly necessary or offering observations about clients that went beyond his assigned research scope.

The behaviour was subtle enough to maintain plausible deniability, but Ian recognized the pattern. Sam Connelly had done exactly the same thing—positioning himself as eager to learn and appreciating any attention from his successful supervisor. The gradual escalation from mild interest to personal devotion had been so subtly orchestrated that Ian hadn't recognized it until far too late.

This time, Ian was prepared. He maintained cordial interactions but made his disinterest in personal connection abundantly clear. Jay Hall would find no encouragement whatsoever if he hoped for anything at all.

The rest of the department, meanwhile, had reached their own conclusions about the new hire.

"Poor kid," Amy murmured to Ela Friday afternoon, watching Jay organize files with what could only be described as reverence. "He's trying so hard to impress Ian, and Ian's treating him like a piece of office equipment."

"Can you blame him?" Ela glanced toward Ian's office, where their boss was reviewing documents. "After what happened with that secretary years ago? Ian's not taking any chances."

"Still." Amy watched Jay polish his computer screen. "The boy's practically glowing every time Ian speaks to him. It's painful to watch."

Across the office, Kim was having a similar conversation with Luc.

"Remember when Leo hired you?" Kim asked, keeping his voice low. "You at least had relevant experience. This one looks like he'd faint if Ian smiled at him."

Luc defended his colleague with good humour. "Give him credit. His work's been solid this week, and he's not pushy about it. Some of Leo's finds have been... more aggressive in their pursuit."

"True. Remember that analyst who kept finding excuses to work late whenever Ian did? At least Jay goes home at five like a normal person. Though I'm not sure if that's professionalism or just terror."

"Probably both. Poor guy seems happy just to be here. Look at him—he's treating those client files like they're made of gold."

Indeed, Jay was handling each document with attention, making neat notes in margins with dedication. His respect for the materials and the processes they represented was either authentic or remarkably well-performed.

"Think Ian's figured out what Leo's doing?" Kim asked.

"Ian figured it out the first time Leo pulled this stunt. He's just too polite to throw qualified candidates out on the street because his friend has a warped sense of humour. Though I suspect Jay's going to be disappointed when he realizes Ian's not interested in office romance."

"Assuming that's what he's after."

"Come on. Look at the way he watches Ian move around the office. If that's not romantic interest, I'll eat my keyboard."

Neither man could see Jay's actual thoughts, which at that moment were focused entirely on whether he should ask Ian about the format for international wire transfer documentation or wait until Monday morning. The complexity of managing client accounts across multiple currencies was fascinating, and Jay wanted to ensure he understood the procedures correctly before handling any actual transactions.

As the workday ended, Ian emerged from his office to find Jay still absorbed in his assignments, making notes in handwriting that belonged in a calligraphy textbook.

"End of the week," Ian announced. "How are you finding the work?"

Jay looked up with an expression of contentment so glaring that Ian felt his suspicions sharpen another degree. "It's exactly what I hoped for. Thank you for the opportunity, and for your patience this week."

"You've done competent work. Keep it up."

The praise was minimal, but Jay received it as if Ian had offered him a promotion. The younger man's delight with such modest acknowledgement was either heartbreakingly innocent or calculatedly manipulative. Ian chose to assume the latter.

Jay gathered his belongings and headed for the elevator, wishing everyone a pleasant weekend.

"Think he'll last?" Amy asked Ela, watching Jay's retreating figure.

"Depends on whether he's really here for the job or for Ian."

From his office doorway, Ian observed the same departure with entirely different concerns. Jay Hall was either the most earnest young man he'd encountered in years, or the most skilful manipulator. Given Ian's history, he knew which possibility he had to prepare for.
