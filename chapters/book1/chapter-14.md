# Chapter 14: Spring
## Scene 1
Quaterly reports
Bonus?
The beginning of April meant the crushing reality of quarterly reporting deadlines. Jay had experienced two previous quarters since joining Turner & Associates, but his newbie status had insulated him from fully understanding what the process demanded. He had observed his colleagues working longer hours and drinking more coffee, but hadn't grasped the true scope of the ordeal. In October, he had been employed for only two months, handing peripheral tasks without grasping the magnitude of the chaos, while the senior staff managed the critical work. January's year-end crunch had been spread over longer periods, with annual reports following more forgiving timelines than their quarterly counterparts.
The warning signs had been evident throughout the previous week. Overtime became standard, takeout containers once again accumulated in bins, and conversations grew increasingly terse as stress mounted. But Jay had been too absorbed in the Orrey scandal to fully register the building tension. Cruver's downfall had provided distraction from the approaching deadline storm.
Now, with April's first Monday stretching ahead like a battlefield, Jay understood what his colleagues meant when they spoke about quarterly reports with the same tone others reserved for natural disasters.
The office atmosphere was electric with stress. Conversations were reduced to essential communications. Lunch breaks disappeared entirely, replaced by hastily consumed sandwiches eaten at desks while reviewing spreadsheets. The office banter died away, leaving only the sound of keyboards, printers, and the occasional frustrated curse when numbers didn't reconcile properly.
Jay resumed his early arrivals without being asked, arriving at seven to find Ian already at his desk with coffee that indicated he had been there for some time. The change felt necessary—there was simply too much work to accomplish during normal business hours.
"Good morning," Jay said quietly, not wanting to disturb Ian's concentration.
Ian looked up with visible relief. "Thank you for coming in early."
"I figured you could use the support."
"I can. This is going to be an intense week."
Jay organized materials, flagged urgent communications, and handled administrative tasks that would otherwise take Ian's time during critical analysis periods. Everything felt secondary to the quarterly reports that consumed the office's collective focus.
The rest of the team had arrived by eight, each person bearing the determination of soldiers preparing for siege.
Jay spent the morning shuttling between departments, delivering documents, coordinating meetings, and handling the tasks that kept the reporting process functioning. His role had expanded beyond supporting Ian to serving as a general assistant for anyone who needed help maintaining their sanity during the crunch.
Ten PM arrived without anyone acknowledging the hour. Ian remained hunched over his computer, and Jay continued managing correspondence, prepared for this level of sustained effort by his previous experience with late nights.
When Jay finally left the office at eleven-thirty, Ian was still working. The pattern continued Tuesday through Thursday—Jay arriving at seven to find Ian already present, leaving at ten or later while Ian remained behind to refine reports that would be scrutinized by clients, regulators, and senior management.
Jay handled responsibilities he had never imagined fell within his job description. Coordinating with IT when servers crashed under the load of simultaneous report generation. Liaising with building security when access cards malfunctioned during a late-night work session. Managing food deliveries for a team too busy to leave their desks for meals.
By Friday, Jay understood why his colleagues had looked like zombies during previous quarters. Sleep became a scarce commodity. He would return to his apartment near midnight, shower quickly, and collapse into bed for five hours before the alarm demanded another day of relentless focus.
The weekend brought no respite. The entire team assembled in the office on Saturday morning, working through analyses that couldn't wait for Monday's continuation. Jay had never worked weekends before, but the experience felt like a rite of passage—proof that he truly belonged to the team that pushed through impossible deadlines together.
"First weekend crunch?" Max asked as they walked to the elevator.
"Yeah. I had no idea it would be this intense."
"The quarterly bonuses exist for a reason. These hours aren't sustainable without proper compensation."
Jay had wondered about the quarterly bonus system, thinking it seemed generous when he first learned about it. Now he understood it was hazard pay for surviving periods when work consumed every waking hour and personal life ceased to exist.
Sunday was marginally less frantic, but only because the most critical analyses were nearing completion. Jay spent the day formatting reports and ensuring all supporting documentation was properly organized. Ian moved through the office like a man possessed, reviewing every detail.
By Sunday evening, Jay felt a bone-deep exhaustion he had never experienced before. The physical fatigue was manageable, but the mental strain of maintaining perfect accuracy while operating on minimal sleep left him feeling hollowed out.
"We're almost through it," Luc said, appearing at Jay's desk with yet another cup of coffee. "Tuesday morning everything gets submitted, and we can return to merely overwhelming workloads instead of impossible ones."
"How do you do this every quarter?"
"Practice. And the knowledge that it's temporary. Plus the bonus makes the suffering worthwhile."
Jay glanced toward Ian's office, where the light burned as it had for days. Ian's dedication was absolute, his focus unshakeable even when exhaustion was clearly taking its toll. Jay had stayed late and arrived early, but Ian had been there before him every morning and remained after he left every night.
The realization that Ian was pushing himself even harder than the rest of them filled Jay with concern and admiration in equal measure. This was leadership—not just directing others through difficult periods, but bearing the heaviest burden personally.
Jay returned to his formatting tasks, determined to handle every possible detail so Ian could focus on the complex analysis work that only he could complete. If Ian was going to sacrifice sleep and personal time to meet their deadlines, Jay would ensure that sacrifice wasn't wasted on mundane tasks he could manage himself.
Tuesday finally arrived, and  Jay watched Ian submit the final file at six PM, then slump back in his chair exhausted. With it came the completion of reports that represented three months of complex financial management distilled into documents that would be scrutinized, analysed, and filed away until the next quarterly deadline demanded similar sacrifice.
## Scene 2
Retreat arrangement
The insane workload of the first quarter was finally easing. The office atmosphere lightened, though everyone remained busy enough to still feel the strain.
Another quarterly party was approaching, and Jay was calm about it. The company events no longer felt like elaborate tests of his social adequacy. Eight months of experience had taught him what to expect—a sophisticated gathering with some clients, but nothing like the intimidating gala that had left him shaken in January. His colleagues, even those from other departments, had always treated him with respect.
The May retreat, however, remained a source of persistent anxiety. HR's continued updates painted a picture of three days of opulence that sounded simultaneously appealing and terrifying. Jay had cautiously asked his colleagues what to expect, hoping for reassurance.
"It's actually fun. Not like those corporate retreats where you have to do trust falls." Ela said.
Their enthusiasm did little to ease Jay's concerns about spending an entire weekend in such an intimidating environment with his colleagues.
The latest email from HR brought an unexpected twist: in the spirit of teamwork and mentorship, senior employees were encouraged to pair with junior ones for the trip. Everyone would be sharing a room—something that rarely happened at these events, where private accommodations were the norm. The change was presented as a way to promote better integration, though it seemed to catch most by surprise.
Jay watched as his team began to sort themselves out. Ela immediately claimed Kim, with whom she regularly socialized outside work, even if she was technically only a year ahead of him. Amy, one of the most senior employees, paired with Zoe, who had joined just over three years ago, before Luc. 
“You should stay with Max,” Luc said to Jay. “I can find someone in another department.”
“That works for me. Even out the numbers.” Max added cheerfully. 
Jay felt gratitude for his colleagues' consideration, but before he could respond, Leo appeared in their workspace with a grin that immediately put everyone on alert.
"Perfect timing," Leo announced. "I've been thinking about the retreat room assignments, and I have a brilliant idea."
Ian emerged from his office, clearly recognizing the tone. "Leo, what are you planning?"
"Team integration," Leo continued, undeterred. "The CFO should set an example by sharing a room with his assistant. Perfect even numbers, no one gets stuck with strangers, and it demonstrates that we're all equals here."
The silence that followed was deafening. Jay felt heat rise in his cheeks as he processed Leo's suggestion, immediately certain that Ian would find the idea appalling.
"That's completely inappropriate," Ian said, his voice tight with barely controlled anger.
Jay's stomach dropped. Of course Ian wouldn't want to share a room with him. "He's right," Jay said quickly. "It would be completely unthinkable for the CFO to stay in a room with someone of my calibre. Or with anyone at all, for that matter."
The hurt in Jay's voice was unmistakable, and Ian's expression fell. Leo's grin widened.
"Actually," Leo said smoothly, "all the C-suite managers are participating. I'm rooming with my junior staffer, and we've encouraged the same throughout the company. It's about breaking down hierarchies, not reinforcing them."
"Max would be the obvious choice for Ian," Amy said uncertainly.
"But that's hardly in the spirit of integration," Leo replied. "Max is already senior staff. Pairing with junior employees like Luc promotes better teamwork practices. Don't you think, Max?"
Max's jovial laugh filled the awkward silence. "Brilliant idea, Leo. Nothing builds team spirit like sharing a bathroom for three days."
"The rooms are quite spacious," Leo added. "Employee comfort is paramount. Two beds, sitting area, private balcony. No one will be roughing it."
Ian's jaw was clenched so tightly Jay worried he might crack a tooth. "I don't have any concerns beyond the well-being of my subordinates. I don't want to make anyone uncomfortable."
"Then it's decided," Leo said brightly. "I'll make the arrangements with HR immediately. This is going to be fun."
He departed with obvious glee, leaving behind a group of colleagues trying to process what had just happened.
"Jay," Luc said quietly, "if this makes you uncomfortable, I'll talk to Ian. Leo can be put in his place."
"I'm not uncomfortable," Jay said, though his voice lacked conviction. "I just don't think I'm quite worthy of sharing a room with Ian."
Luc laughed. "Ian's not a medieval lord, Jay. We're all coworkers of the same standing. He can be intimidating, but—"
"He's not intimidating," Jay interrupted. "He's stern, but he's very comfortable to be around."
"Alright then," Luc said with a smile. "You'll have a great time."
Jay nodded, trying to convince himself that was true. At least he knew Ian was trustworthy and kind. Whatever his reservations about the arrangement, Jay was certain he wouldn't suffer any grievances.
Twenty minutes later, Ian cornered Leo in the break room.
"What the hell do you think you're doing?"
Leo's expression remained cheerful. "Helping my dearest friend find happiness, even if it means I have to suffer extreme violence in the process."
"You're going to suffer more than violence if you don't fix this."
"Think about it rationally," Leo said, switching to a more diplomatic tone. "An event like this is going to be overwhelming for Jay. Having you in his corner will actually make it easier for him. You'll be protecting him from discomfort."
"I'll be crossing every line."
"Imagine if Jay got paired with Max and had to listen to his crass comments half the night. Or ended up with some stranger from accounting."
Ian's anger faltered slightly. The thought of Jay feeling vulnerable or out of place at the retreat was distressing.
"You're manipulating me," Ian said.
"Absolutely. But I'm not wrong about Jay needing someone safe in his corner. And whether you want to admit it or not, you're the person he trusts most."
Ian stared at his friend, recognizing the truth in Leo's words despite his frustration. Jay had looked hurt when he'd protested the arrangement, as if Ian's objection had been personal.
"Three days, Leo. Three days of temptation I've been carefully avoiding."
"Three days of making sure one of your employees feels supported and comfortable. That's what good managers do."
Ian's resistance crumbled under the weight of his own protective instincts. "I'm going to make your life miserable for this."
"I'm counting on it," Leo said with a grin. "But you'll thank me eventually."
Ian doubted that, but as he returned to his office, he couldn't deny that the prospect of spending three days ensuring Jay's comfort felt less like a burden and more like a privilege he didn't deserve. The retreat was still weeks away, but already it loomed as a test of every defence Ian had built against his growing feelings.
Jay, meanwhile, returned to his work with cautious optimism. Whatever his initial anxiety about the arrangement, he trusted Ian more than anyone else at the company. If he had to manage three days of splendour and team-building activities, there was no one he'd rather have watching his back.
## Scene 3
Spring has sprung
As April went on, spring came into full bloom. The city shed its winter coat, revealing patches of green that emerged from every crack and corner. Jay felt his energy returning with the season, and he tackled the backlog of life that had accumulated during his illness and the intense work period.
He set aside an older suit to keep at work—still presentable, if not as refined as his current rotation. It was the perfect choice for emergencies. He slipped it into a garment bag and brought it to the office, hanging it discreetly in the small coat closet near his desk. Better to be prepared than caught off guard again.
The rain-soaked suit had been rescued from the dry cleaners the week before, returned to its former condition without any trace of its ordeal. Jay examined it, running his fingers along the fabric. The relief was disproportionate to the cost of replacement, but he couldn't shake his ingrained frugality despite the increase in his bank account.
The lavish boutique outfit hung in his closet like a monument to poor decision-making. Every time he saw it, he winced at the memory of spending thousands on clothes he never wanted to buy. 
The begging of the month had brought a sizable quarterly bonus, pushing his financial situation into a comfortable territory. Yet the emergency shopping spree still rankled. He'd grown up counting every penny, and old habits died hard.
His apartment needed better preparation for future crises. The medicine cabinet overflowed with Ian's care package, but he'd been caught unprepared in other ways. He spent an afternoon organizing supplies: shelf-stable canned soups, crispbread, bottled water, ice packs, wet wipes, tissues. Everything placed strategically wherever his studio permitted.
The gym membership had been on his mental to-do list for months. He'd been thinking about Ian's obvious fitness, his perfect posture. Jay's own physical condition was embarrassing by comparison. 
He'd researched options in his neighborhood months ago but never followed through.  He opted for a modest facility in a nondescript building near his apartment. Their website promised beginner-friendly programs—exactly what he needed.
Turner & Associates provided memberships to upscale fitness centers in the financial district, but the thought of running into colleagues while sweating through a workout made him uncomfortable. This place felt manageable.
The gym occupied the ground floor, with painted concrete floors and equipment that looked worn but was well-maintained. The front desk clerk, a woman in her fifties, handed him a clipboard. "First time?"
"Yes. I saw you have a beginner program?"
"Absolutely. Rus will be your trainer today. He's great with people who are just starting out."
Rus turned out to be younger than Jay expected, with a patient demeanour. He was neither intimidatingly muscular nor dismissively casual—just encouraging.
"What are your goals?" Rus asked as they walked through the gym floor.
"I'm completely out of shape. I got sick recently and realized I need to take better care of myself."
"Good motivation. We'll start easy and build from there."
The first ten minutes on the treadmill were humbling. Jay's breathing became labored faster than he'd expected, and sweat soaked through his new gym shirt before he'd even broken into a proper jog. Rus noticed his struggle and guided him to a rowing machine.
"This is better for building endurance without impact. Try it for five minutes."
The rowing was easier on his lungs but brutal on muscles he'd forgotten he had. By the end of the hour, Jay felt simultaneously exhausted and energized. His legs shook as he walked to the locker room.
"How do you feel?" Rus asked as Jay gathered his things.
"Like I haven't moved my body in years."
"That's normal. Try to come back twice a week. Build the habit first. Intensity comes later."
Jay walked home slowly, but the soreness was not entirely unpleasant, giving him a sense of finally taking action instead of just thinking about it.
His phone rang that afternoon while he was cooking dinner. His mother's name appeared on the screen, and he answered with the slight wariness that family conversations always brought.
"Jay, sweetheart, how are you?"
"I'm good, Mom."
"Good, good. I'm so glad. Listen, I wanted to talk to you about something exciting. Ema's graduating from middle school this year."
Jay waited for more information, unsure why this required a phone call. His half-sister was fifteen, which made middle school graduation fairly predictable.
"She's been working so hard on this cheerleading act for the ceremony," his mother continued. "The whole squad is performing, and it's really important to her. She's been practicing for months."
The request was coming. Jay could hear it building in his mother's phrasing.
"The graduation is at the end of June, and we're making it a real family celebration. Your aunt and uncle are coming, and even your cousin Min. It's been so long since we've all been together."
Jay's stomach tightened. He hadn't been back to his hometown in over a year, not since the awkward Christmas visit before last. The idea of handling family dynamics felt exhausting.
"Ema specifically asked if you were coming," his mother continued. "She says you're the only one who never treats her like a little kid."
That was news to Jay. His interactions with Ema had been minimal and mostly centered around polite small talk during holiday visits. Maybe the Christmas present he’d sent had an impact.
"I'll have to check my schedule. Work's been really busy lately."
"Of course, honey. I know your job is important. But it would mean so much to her—to all of us—if you could make it. We hardly ever see you anymore."
The guilt came wrapped in affection, voiced with concern that made it impossible to ignore. His mother had a gift for that—never demanding, never harsh, just earnest enough to make refusal feel ungrateful. While Jay loved her, unease stirred beneath the warmth. Going home always felt a little like stepping into someone else’s life.
"I'll try, Mom. I really will. But I can't promise anything right now."
"That's all I ask. Just think about it, okay? It's been too long since you've been home."
After the call ended, Jay sat in his apartment, dinner preparations forgotten. Home. The word felt strange, disconnected from the small town where he'd grown up feeling like an outsider. His mother's house, filled with his step-father's family photos and his half-siblings' achievements, had never quite felt like his place.
He pushed the decision aside for now. The company retreat loomed in his immediate future, and that felt like enough stress to handle at the moment. June was still months away. By then, maybe he'd have a better sense of whether he could face going back to where he'd started.
## Scene 4
Confidence
The night of the quarterly gathering crept up quickly, and Jay set about getting dressed without the apprehension he once felt. The navy suit felt like an old friend when Jay pulled it from his closet. The same outfit that had made him feel like a fraud at his first quarterly party now seemed perfect—elegant but conservative, well-fitted without being flashy. He selected a tie with subtle burgundy stripes, bolder than his normal choices but not enough to make him feel exposed.
The evening ahead didn't trigger the anxiety that had plagued him before. He understood these events and knew what to expect now. 
The venue was an upscale hotel, as always. Jay walked through the entrance without the awkward scanning he'd done at his first company event. He didn't need to search for familiar faces or worry about standing alone looking lost. He headed straight for the buffet, knowing exactly what he wanted. Experience had taught him that Max would materialize near the food within minutes of his own arrival, drawn by an infallible instinct for quality catering.
He was working on his second helping of an outstanding meat pie when Max appeared with Ela and Kim in tow.
"Started without us, I see," Max said, loading his plate with generous portions.
"The lamb is great," Jay replied, cutting another piece. "I wasn't about to let it get cold."
Kim sampled something that might have been duck confit. "They really outdid themselves this time. Last quarter's spread was great, but this restaurant is spectacular."
"The wine selection is impressive too," Ela added, returning from the bar with a glass of something that caught the light like liquid amber.
The conversation flowed around food and ambiance, comfortable topics that required no performance. Jay was relaxed, which would have been impossible months ago.
The rest of the team filtered in gradually. Jay tried the colorful cocktails without worrying about maintaining perfect composure, sampled appetizers without calculating whether he looked appropriately sophisticated doing so.
When Ian appeared, he moved through the room with grace, exchanging pleasantries with each group. Jay watched him approach their circle without the sharp awareness that had once made every interaction feel like a test.
"Evening, everyone. I trust you're all enjoying the hospitality."
"The catering budget was well spent," Amy replied. "Though I suspect we'll be hearing about it in the next expense review."
“Worth every penny,” Ian remarked as he took a bite.
He included Jay in the brief conversation that followed, nothing more or less than he offered the others. Jay felt neither snubbed nor singled out, just part of the group. When Ian moved on to entertain the senior partners, Jay realized how foolish his previous anxiety had been.
The evening dispersed into smaller conversations, people drifting between groups as mood and interest dictated. Jay remained near the buffet, no longer self-conscious about his appetite.
Luc returned after a circuit of the room to find Jay working on a tropical pudding topped with crystallized ginger.
"Still eating?" Luc asked with amusement. "You've been at this for an hour."
"The food is superb," Jay replied without shame, taking another spoonful. "It deserves to be appreciated."
"You look more at ease than during previous events," Luc observed.
"After the trauma of the gala, a small company party feels almost like home. I recognize nearly everyone in the room now. Maybe not on speaking terms with all of them, but I know the faces."
"That's progress," Luc said. "Though I'm not sure your relationship with the dessert table qualifies as friendly anymore. It's more like devotion."
Jay laughed. "I prefer to think of it as mutual attraction."
Near the end of the event, Leo approached carefully, as if he was testing uncertain waters. They hadn't spoken privately since his visit to Jay's apartment months ago, when the conversation had ended with tension and unresolved feelings.
"Jay. Enjoying yourself?"
"The food is outstanding. The company is tolerable."
"I thought you'd forgiven me," Leo said, though his tone made it clear he’d expected this reaction.
"I have. But I still don't trust you at all."
"Fair enough. I'm glad you made the best of the opportunity that was presented to you, regardless of what the underlying motives were."
"So am I. The opportunity turned out well. No thanks to your methods."
"Undoubtedly. But I'm still taking credit for the introduction."
Jay returned home that evening content. He'd survived the event without anxiety, without the desperate need to prove himself that had characterized his early months at Turner & Associates.
From across the room, Ian had watched Jay's confidence with relief. He remembered the deliberate coldness he'd shown at Jay's first quarterly party, the way he'd let his own emotional turmoil dictate his behavior. The memory made him feel ashamed.
Jay had looked lost that night, unsure of his place. Ian had recognized the vulnerability and responded by making it worse, using his own authority to reinforce Jay's sense of exclusion. He'd been shielding himself from feelings he didn't want to acknowledge, but Jay had paid the price for Ian's emotional confusion.
Tonight, Jay had needed no protection from the environment or the people in it. He'd moved through the evening freely, at ease with colleagues who had become friends. Watching him laugh at something Luc said, Ian felt Jay had found his place here. Ian had played a role in that success, but he'd also created unnecessary obstacles along the way.
Whatever complicated feelings Jay stirred in him, they were his burden to bear. Jay should never again be on the receiving end of Ian's struggles, never again made to feel unwelcome because of battles he hadn't chosen to fight.
The resolution sat heavy in Ian's chest as he made his final rounds of the evening, a promise to himself that felt both necessary and impossibly difficult to keep.
## Scene 5
Coffee gesture
The quarterly party had come and gone, a pleasant enough evening, but unremarkable enough that Monday morning brought minimal discussion of who had attended and who had managed graceful early exits. 
April had delivered an unpleasant surprise from the weather gods. After a few days of spring warmth that had everyone shedding heavy coats and planning outdoor lunch destinations, the temperature had plummeted overnight, returning the city to winter's grip.
"I'm not going out in that," Luc declared, staring through the office windows at the gray sky that threatened rain or possibly snow. "Let's just order from the usual places."
"Agreed," Amy said.
Zoe also nodded. "I spent all morning looking forward to not having to wear my heavy coat anymore. I'm not changing my mind now."
But Kim was undeterred by the hostile weather. "There's a new place I want to try. Sweet and spicy with tropical influences. Could be interesting."
"Or terrible," Max grumbled, but he was already reaching for his coat. "But I suppose terrible food beats another day of noodles."
Jay became part of a smaller expedition—just the four of them braving the cold while half the team remained in the office's climate-controlled comfort. It felt different, like a specialized mission.
"Spicy with fruit," Kim read from his phone as they approached the restaurant. "The reviews are either raving or completely horrified. No middle ground." 
"That's a good sign," Max said dryly. "Nothing quite like polarizing opinions about food."
The restaurant was decorated with bright murals that seemed to mock the gray weather outside. The menu contained a bewildering array of dishes that combined flavors Jay would never have imagined together.
"Mango habanero chicken with coconut rice," Kim read enthusiastically. "Or pineapple curry beef with plantain chips."
"I'm getting a normal sandwich," Ela announced after scanning the options with obvious skepticism. "This is too experimental for a Monday."
Jay ordered something described as "glazed chicken with lychee and pickled dragonfruit," uncertain whether he was ordering lunch or volunteering for torture. The quarterly reports marathon had left him feeling more adventurous about small risks, as if surviving that ordeal had earned him permission to be slightly bolder in other areas.
Kim and Ela fell into animated conversation about flavor combinations and restaurant concepts. Max provided commentary that grew increasingly amused as their meal progressed.
"This is actually interesting," Jay admitted, surprised by how the unusual combinations somehow worked together.
Kim was delighted with his choices, while Ela remained unconvinced that experimental cuisine was an improvement over traditional seafood restaurants.
"It's fine for a one-time experience," she concluded, "but I'll stick with places that do one thing really well."
The walk back to the office reinforced Jay's gratitude for his expensive winter coat. The wind cut through the business district, making April feel more like February. His colleagues hunched into their outerwear while he remained comfortably insulated from the elements.
Halfway back, Jay noticed a new coffee shop that had opened recently in a space formerly occupied by a cellular phone store. The interior looked warm and inviting, with chalkboard menus advertising seasonal specials that seemed perfect for combating the unexpected chill.
"What if we brought coffee back for everyone? Something to help with team morale after this weather disappointment. I can use the company card."
Kim brightened immediately. "Good thinking."
Jay had been managing the department's discretionary expense account for months but had found few opportunities to use it for team benefits. Coffee seemed like an appropriate expenditure for boosting spirits during dreary weather.
Inside the coffee shop, they examined the seasonal offerings with the same adventurous spirit that had guided their lunch choices. Spring blend with lavender and honey. Cardamom spice latte with oat milk foam. Cherry blossom white chocolate mocha that seemed designed specifically for April's conflicted weather.
"Let's get everyone something different," Jay decided. "Make it an adventure for the whole team."
They placed orders for seven specialty drinks, each person receiving whatever struck the group as interesting or appropriate. Jay deliberated over Ian's selection longer than the others. Ian typically drank black coffee from a specific blend. Consistent, no surprises.
But Jay felt reckless. He ordered Ian a maple bourbon latte with cinnamon, knowing it was nothing like his preferences but hoping the gesture would outweigh any reservations.
The walk back to the office involved some coordination to prevent spills while avoiding wind that seemed determined to test their balance. They entered the building with the triumphant air of explorers returning from successful expedition.
"Coffee delivery service," Kim announced to the office at large, distributing the various drinks while explaining their selections.
Jay approached Ian's office with the maple bourbon latte, suddenly uncertain about his impulsive choice. Ian looked up from his computer with mild curiosity as Jay placed the cup on his desk.
"What's this?"
"Seasonal coffee from the new place down the street. Thought it might help with team morale given the weather."
Ian's expression was complicated—surprise mixed with something that might have been amusement or concern. "You didn't have to do that."
"I know. But everyone seemed to need something to lift their spirits."
Ian lifted the cup and took a sip, his face registering the unexpected flavors with diplomatic neutrality. "It's... interesting."
"You don't have to drink it if you don't like it. I know it's not your usual style."
"No, it's fine." Ian took another sip, seeming to consider the taste more thoughtfully. "Actually, it's quite good. Different, but good."
Jay felt relieved. "The company card has been sitting unused for months. Seemed like a good opportunity."
After Jay returned to his desk, Ian continued sipping the unfamiliar coffee. The maple sweetness was foreign to his palate, more dessert than beverage, but the gesture made it oddly enjoyable.
Jay had felt confident enough to make an independent decision about team morale, comfortable enough to use discretionary funds without seeking approval first. The coffee was evidence that Jay felt at home at Turner & Associates, that he saw himself as someone with agency to improve his colleagues' day.
The sweetness of the drink reminded Ian uncomfortably of Jay himself—kindness offered without calculation or expectation of reward. It was rare to encounter such generosity in their industry, where most gestures had hidden motives or strategic considerations.
Ian finished the entire cup despite his preference for savoury flavors, reluctant to waste something Jay had chosen specifically for him. The gesture had been small, but this thoughtfulness made long workdays more bearable.
He would have to be careful not to read too much significance into this, Ian reminded himself. It was a good development for Jay. Nothing more than that.
