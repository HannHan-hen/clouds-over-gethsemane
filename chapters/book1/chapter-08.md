# Chapter 8: The festive season

## Scene 1: Decorations

December came on with a biting cold, catching the city by surprise. After months of unseasonably warm weather, winter finally announced itself with sharp winds and frost that decorated office windows with delicate patterns. Along with the drop in temperature, a festive atmosphere filled the building, and by the second week of December, the lobby displayed an enormous Christmas tree that commanded attention from everyone entering the Northlight Financial Center.

At Turner & Associates, the crisis pace of the Hartwell integration had finally subsided. The initial chaos of bringing on a major new client turned manageable, with tasks distributed among the team. Ian's insane days had returned to more reasonable proportions, and the exhaustion that had characterized his appearance throughout November had lifted.

Jay noticed the change immediately. Ian's morning briefings proceeded without the underlying fatigue that had marked recent weeks. His clothes resumed their typical perfection, and the slight hesitation that had crept into his responses disappeared. The relief Jay felt at seeing Ian return to normal surprised him.

"The Christmas tree debate begins today," Luc announced, appearing at Jay's desk with theatrical solemnity. "Brace yourself for the annual display of office democracy at its most chaotic."

"Christmas tree debate?" Jay asked, looking up from his screen.

"Office tradition," Kim explained, joining the conversation. "Every year, administration sets up the lobby tree, and every year, we decorate our own tree in the office area. And every year, we spend an hour arguing about colour schemes before Ian intervenes with executive authority."

"It's actually quite entertaining," Ela added, pulling three large storage boxes from the supply closet. "Amy has strong opinions about aesthetic cohesion, Max believes in festive chaos, and everyone else just wants to hang ornaments without extended philosophical discussions."

Jay watched with curiosity as his colleagues gathered around the boxes, which overflowed with decorations accumulated over years of celebrations. The two metre pine tree stood in the corner, undecorated but filling the space with the scent of evergreen. Office Christmas trees had been nonexistent at his previous workplace, where holiday acknowledgement consisted of a single poinsettia in the reception area and a brief mention in the company newsletter.

"This year, I'm advocating for a sophisticated monochromatic approach," Amy announced, unpacking silver ornaments. "Silver and white, perhaps with touches of gold for warmth."

"Absolutely not," Max declared, pulling out a collection that appeared to represent every colour in the spectrum. "Christmas trees should be joyful. The more colours, the better."

"That's not joyful, that's overwhelming," Amy protested. "There's beauty in restraint."

"There's boredom in restraint," Max countered, holding up a particularly garish red and green ornament. "This is what Christmas should look like."

Luc turned to Jay with an expression of amused resignation. "This happens every year. They'll argue until Ian arrives and makes a decision that pleases no one and somehow works perfectly."

Jay watched the good-natured bickering with amusement. Amy arranged ornaments by colour and size, Max deliberately mixed patterns and textures.

"It's not a hostage negotiation, Amy," Kim said. "And Max, I'm not sure chaos counts as a design philosophy."

"What's your preference?" Ela asked Jay. "Are you team sophisticated minimalism or team festive chaos?"

"I've never really had strong opinions about Christmas decorations. I enjoy whatever other people created."

"A diplomatic answer," Luc said approvingly. "Perfect for avoiding the crossfire."

The debate continued for another ten minutes, with Amy and Max presenting increasingly elaborate arguments for their respective approaches. Jay enjoyed the theatrical nature of their disagreement, recognizing it as a silly conflict that only emerged among people who liked each other.

"What seems to be the annual crisis?" Ian emerged from his office, surveying the scene with an expression of patient resignation.

"Colour scheme dispute," Amy and Max said simultaneously, then glared at each other.

Ian approached the boxes of decorations, examining the contents. "Crystal and teal," he said after a moment's consideration. "Purple accents, silver details. It's festive and sophisticated without being sterile."

Amy and Max exchanged looks of mutual dissatisfaction, but neither protested. The compromise had the advantage of disappointing both parties equally.

"Crystal and teal it is," Amy said.

"I suppose that's acceptable," Max agreed grudgingly.

The team, freed from decision-making paralysis, began enthusiastic decorating. Jay got paired with Ian, hanging strings of silver garland while his colleagues distributed ornaments. The work was surprisingly intimate, requiring tight cooperation.

"Hand me that section," Ian said, indicating a length of garland that had tangled around Jay's feet.

Jay passed the decoration, their fingers brushing briefly in the exchange. The contact was entirely accidental, but it left Jay with an unexpected awareness of Ian's proximity. They adjusted the garland until it draped properly across the tree's branches.

"This is nice," Jay said, stepping back to examine their work. "I'd forgotten how much I enjoy Christmas decorating."

"You don't celebrate at home?" Ian asked, fixing a silver ornament.

"I haven't had space for decorations. And since I live alone, it never seemed worth the effort."

Ian glanced at him with an expression Jay couldn't interpret. "Will you be traveling to see family this year?"

"I'm still deciding. Last year the atmosphere was pretty tense, and I'm not sure I want to repeat the experience."

They continued working, adding crystal baubles and straightening the lights. Around them, the office was filled with the cheerful noise of collaborative effort. Luc and Kim debated the placement of purple accents, Amy ensured the colour distribution remained balanced, and Max added silver details with slightly more enthusiasm than his earlier protests had suggested.

Jay got caught up in the holiday spirit. The bickering of his colleagues, the joy of creating something beautiful together—all of it felt like a Christmas tradition he'd always imagined.

"There," Ian said, adjusting the final section of garland. "That should be properly balanced."

Jay looked at the tree, now turned by their collective work into something truly festive. The crystal ornaments caught the office lights, the teal and purple accents provided just enough colour to avoid monotony, and the silver details added elegance.

"It looks perfect," Jay said, meaning it completely. "Much better than I expected from a compromise solution."

"Compromise solutions often work better than anyone anticipates," Ian replied.

As the decorating concluded, Jay felt content. The office was warm and welcoming and even the mundane work tasks seemed more pleasant in the festive atmosphere.

As Jay prepared to leave the office in the afternoon, he considered something he'd never contemplated before: buying Christmas decorations for his own apartment. With his first full paycheck as a permanent employee deposited in his account—even larger than his previous salary—he finally had the financial security to indulge in unnecessary but pleasant expenses.

The idea of having his own small Christmas tree, decorated according to his own preferences, felt increasingly appealing, even if he didn't really have space for it. Jay was beginning to understand what it meant to create comfort instead of merely enduring circumstances.

## Scene 2: Christmas preparations

On Friday, just after work, Jay stood before the display window of an upscale tailor, studying the elegant evening wear arranged behind the glass. The mannequins wore impeccable black-tie attire—tuxedos with silk lapels, white shirts and bow ties.

"Good afternoon," the salesman said as Jay entered the shop. "How can I help you today?"

"I need a tuxedo for a company function," Jay replied, still adjusting to the idea that he belonged in such an establishment. "Something appropriate for a formal gala."

The salesman appraised him with a practised eye. "Excellent. When is the event?"

"January twenty fourth."

"Perfect timing. We'll have everything ready well before then. A proper fitting will take about four weeks—we pride ourselves on meticulous tailoring."

The salesman led him through the process, taking measurements and discussing fabric options. The final price would have horrified him six months ago, but now he nodded and provided his credit card information without the knot of anxiety in his stomach.

"We'll call you when everything is ready," the salesman said, handing him a receipt. "You'll look magnificent."

The compliment left Jay uneasy. He gave awkward thanks and hurried out of the shop.

His next stop was the small garden centre. The scent of evergreens hit him immediately—fresh, clean, and somehow hopeful. He wandered through the rows of trees, most of them far too large for his modest apartment.

"Looking for something specific?" asked a woman in a canvas apron.

"Something small," Jay said. "I have limited space."

She led him to a section of tabletop trees, each one perfectly proportioned despite their diminutive size. "These are lovely for apartments. They smell just as good as the big ones."

Jay selected a tree that reached barely fifty centimetres tall with full and symmetrical branches. The woman helped him choose a simple stand and wrapped the tree in protective netting.

"You'll want to get it in water soon," she advised. "And don't put it near any heat sources."

Jay thanked her and hauled his purchase to the nearby department store, where he spent an hour selecting ornaments. He chose crystal balls, silver garland that reminded him of the office decorations, and a string of warm white lights. The selections was deliberate—each piece contributing to a specific vision he hadn't realized he'd been forming.

Back in his apartment, Jay cleared space on the wide windowsill—one of the few spots that could accommodate the tree. He pushed aside a stack of books, then set the tree in place. After filling the stand with water, he adjusted the tree until it stood straight, makinh the best use of the limited space.

The lights went on first, their warm glow transforming the modest space immediately. Jay wound them around the branches, ensuring even coverage. The crystal ornaments came next, each one catching the light in different ways. Finally, he draped the silver garland, stepping back periodically to assess the overall effect.

The finished tree was tiny but radiant. It filled the corner with gentle light and the fresh scent of pine, making the entire apartment feel different—more like home.

Jay sat on his couch and admired his work. The tree represented something he'd never allowed himself before, decorating simply because he wanted to, not because it served any practical purpose.

Jay finally picked up the phone to call his mother. He'd decided to stay home for Christmas this year, and the thought of breaking the news had been weighing on him for days. As he waited for her to answer, he steeled himself for the conversation he'd been dreading.

"Hi, Mom."

"Jay! How are you, honey? I was just thinking about Christmas plans."

"Actually, that's what I wanted to talk to you about. I don't think I can make it home this year."

"Oh," his mother said finally. "Is everything all right?"

"Everything's fine. Better than fine, actually. But this new job has me working on a major project, and I can't take the time off right now."

"I see." Her disappointment was evident despite her attempt to hide it. "Well, work is important. I understand."

"I'm sorry, Mom. I really am."

"Don't apologize for doing well, sweetheart. I'm proud of you. It's just... this is only the second time you've missed Christmas."

Jay remembered the first time—his final year of college, when everything had felt impossible and he'd been too ashamed to explain why he couldn't afford the trip home. This felt entirely different.

"I know. I'll make it up to you."

"You don't need to make anything up. I just miss you."

"I miss you too."

They talked for a few more minutes about safe topics—the weather, his half-siblings' school activities. When they hung up, Jay felt both guilt and relief at getting out of family obligations. But tonight, the guilt felt manageable. He wasn't avoiding Christmas because he was struggling. He was choosing to spend it differently because he finally could.

The next morning, Jay walked to the shopping district with a specific mission. He'd decided to send gifts to his family. The prospect felt strange but pleasant—another indulgence he could now afford.

For his mother, he chose a bottle of perfume—bold and elegant. For his stepfather, a good bottle of whiskey, the sort that wouldn't gather dust on the shelf. The choices seemed obvious and safe.

He hesitated a little longer over gifts for his siblings. For Ema, fifteen and already passionate about makeup, he picked out a set of quality brushes and a neutral eyeshadow palette—classic, nothing too trendy, but miles above the drugstore sets she probably used. For Tim, the oldest at seventeen and rarely indoors, he decided on a military grade multitool, sturdy enough for camping trips and after-school projects. For Ari, twelve and still fascinated by building things, he picked a building block set—the kind that promised a dozen different vehicles in one box.

He knew the gifts were more expensive than strictly necessary, but he didn't mind. It wasn't just about showing he was doing well now—though that was part of it. He wanted their holidays to be a little brighter, even if they'd all grown apart. Affection didn't require closeness, sometimes it was just the effort to give something nice.

The sales clerk wrapped the gifts in festive paper. Jay planned to arrange delivery later, ensuring the packages would arrive in time.

Walking home with bags full of gifts, loaded down like a donkey, Jay realized the persistent discomfort that had shadowed him for months—the anxiety about money, about his place in the world, about whether he deserved good things—had mostly disappeared.

He couldn't pinpoint exactly when it had happened. Maybe it was the successful completion of the client crisis, or simply the accumulation of small victories that had built his confidence. Maybe it was the approaching holiday season, which had always held a special magic for him despite his complicated relationship with his family. Or maybe, Jay thought as he climbed the stairs to his apartment, life was finally looking up.

He unlocked his door and stepped inside, greeted by the gentle glow of his Christmas tree. The sight filled him with actual happiness. He made coffee and sat by the window, watching the city move below while his tree cast dancing shadows on the walls. The evergreen scent had grown stronger overnight, filling the apartment with the promise of celebration.

## Scene 3: Christmas party

In the week that followed, the office entered into the frantic pace of the season—deadlines looming, inboxes swelling, but a sense of focus taking hold. Holiday anticipation crept in at the margins, just enough to soften the usual year-end rush.

Finally, on a Friday evening, the pace broke for the annual Christmas party. The restaurant buzzed with conversation and the clink of glasses as Turner & Associates' staff mingled around elegantly arranged standing tables. Jay adjusted his suit jacket, the same one he'd worn to every formal occasion, and surveyed the space. Chandeliers cast a gentle glow on winter greenery, and tables throughout the room were set with trays of food and drinks, inviting everyone to serve themselves.

"Jay!" Amy called from across the room, waving him over to where she stood with Kim and Zoe. "Come try the salmon canapés—they're incredible."

Jay made his way through the crowd, grabbing a glass of eggnog on his way. The restaurant had been completely reserved for the company, creating an intimate atmosphere.

"This place is amazing," Zoe said, gesturing around the room. "Turner Senior really outdid himself this year."

"He does every year," Kim replied, sampling a pastry. "Remember last year's party at that rooftop venue? I thought Ela was going to freeze to death."

"I survived," Ela said, appearing beside them with a plate of hors d'oeuvres. "Though I learned my lesson about outdoor December parties."

They chatted about the food, the decorations, and the year's successes. Jay sipped his eggnog, feeling the warmth of the alcohol ease him further into the evening. The opulent surroundings didn't faze him anymore. He was relaxed, part of the group, and the sense of being an outsider had faded.

"Attention, everyone!" Turner Senior's voice reached across the room as he took position near the restaurant's central fireplace. The crowd gradually quieted and turned toward him.

"I want to thank you all for another exceptional year. When I started this company thirty years ago, I dreamed of building something that would stand the test of time. You've all exceeded those dreams."

He spoke about specific achievements, mentioning several team members by name, and outlined the company's impressive year-end projections. Jay felt pride as Turner Senior praised the team's ability to handle complex client situations and maintain their reputation for excellence.

"Now, before we continue enjoying this excellent meal, I have something for each of you." Turner Senior gestured to a table laden with beautifully wrapped baskets. "A small token of appreciation for your hard work and dedication."

The gifts were extraordinary—wicker baskets lined with silk and filled with imported chocolates, premium wines, artisanal cheeses, and various confectionery. Tucked into each basket was an envelope containing spa vouchers.

"Two full days at Serenity Springs Resort," Amy read from her voucher. "This is incredible."

Jay opened his own envelope and stared at the elegant certificate. The spa package was designed for couples, with treatments and accommodations clearly intended for two people. He felt heat rise in his face as he realized he had no one to bring.

"Who are you taking?" Zoe asked, showing off her own voucher.

"I'm not sure yet," Jay replied, hoping his voice sounded casual.

"I'm dragging my husband," Amy said. "He'll complain about the whole thing, but he'll secretly love it."

The conversation moved on to holiday plans as everyone returned to their food and drinks. Jay stood at the table with Ian, Max, Luc, and Ela, listening as they discussed their upcoming time off.

"My wife's parents booked us a house in the mountains," Max said, cutting into a piece of beef tenderloin. "A week of skiing and hot chocolate. I can't wait."

"Sounds exhausting," Luc replied with a grin. "I'm planning to sleep until noon every day and binge-watch terrible movies."

"I'm visiting my sister," Ela added. "She just had a baby, so I'll be playing aunt for a week."

"What about you, Jay?" Max asked. "Any exciting plans?"

"I'm staying home, actually. I need some rest after the hectic time I've had getting used to the new job."

"That sounds perfect," Luc said. "Sometimes the best vacation is no vacation at all."

The conversation moved to work coverage during the holiday period. It became clear that roughly half the team would be taking time off, leaving a smaller group to handle any urgent matters.

"So it'll be just us," Ela said, looking around the table. "Ian, Jay, Luc, and me. I hope everyone else works hard to finish all the major tasks before they disappear."

"We always manage," Ian replied. "The holiday period is usually quieter anyway."

Jay was curious about Ian's own plans but didn't dare ask directly. Ian hadn't mentioned any travel or family gatherings, and Jay wondered if the topic was off-limits.

As the evening progressed, the atmosphere grew more relaxed. Groups formed and reformed as people moved between tables, sharing stories and laughing over the excellent food. Jay no longer felt like the nervous newcomer worried about saying the wrong thing.

The crowd began to thin as the evening wound down. Some employees had families to return to, others had made dinner plans elsewhere. Jay was preparing to leave when Leo appeared at his elbow.

"Jay, good to see you enjoying yourself. I trust you're prepared for the holiday work schedule?"

"Of course," Jay replied curtly.

"Excellent. You'll need to take good care of Ian during that time. He always works through the holidays—never really had any family plans, you know. Estranged from his relatives and all that. I'm glad you'll be there to keep him company."

Jay felt a flash of irritation at Leo's presumptuous tone. "I'm sure Ian can take care of himself. He managed perfectly well before I arrived."

Leo raised an eyebrow at Jay's sharp response. "Just looking out for a friend, Jay. No need to get defensive."

"I'm not defensive," Jay replied, though he could hear the edge in his own voice. "I'm just not particularly interested in your insights about office dynamics."

Leo smiled. "Fair enough. Have a good evening, Jay."

Jay still hadn't forgiven Leo, and the casual way Leo discussed Ian's personal life bothered him. But beneath his irritation, Jay felt concern for Ian.

The image of Ian working alone through the holidays, with no family to visit and no plans beyond the office, struck Jay as profoundly sad. He thought of his own small apartment with its tiny Christmas tree, and wondered what Ian's holidays looked like.

Jay collected his gift basket and said his goodbyes, thanking Turner Senior for the generous evening. As he walked to the metro, he thought not about his own holiday plans, but about Ian's solitary Christmas.

The spa voucher felt heavy in his pocket, a reminder of experiences designed for sharing that he would likely never use. But more than that, it reminded him that he wasn't the only one who would be spending the holidays alone.

## Scene 4: Holidays

The week following the party brought a surge of pre-holiday urgency. Everyone rushed to complete projects and tie up loose ends before the office closed for Christmas. Jay stayed late most nights, helping process year-end reports and ensuring client communications were current. Work on the annual reports had started in mid-December and was expected to continue through the first half of January, with everyone putting in overtime in a tense atmosphere.

"This is insane," Luc muttered, sorting through a stack of documents. "Why does everyone suddenly remember they need things done right before Christmas?"

"Same reason people shop on Christmas Eve," Ela replied, not looking up from her computer. "Poor planning and magical thinking."

Jay had spent his lunch break the previous day at the post office, shipping packages to his family. He'd divided the contents of his gift basket—the spa voucher went to his mother and stepfather, the chocolates and artisanal cookies to his half-siblings, while he kept the wine and aged cheeses for himself. The gesture felt right, a way to share his good fortune without the complicated emotions of an actual visit.

By Wednesday afternoon, the office atmosphere turned celebratory. People packed up their desks and exchanged final Christmas wishes before heading home to their families.

"Amy, have a wonderful time with your parents," Ian said, approaching her desk. "Give them my regards."

Amy stood and surprised him with a quick hug. "Merry Christmas, Ian. Try to enjoy yourself."

Ian accepted the embrace with good grace, though Jay noticed the slight stiffness in his posture. He moved through the office systematically, offering handshakes and holiday wishes to each team member.

"Max, enjoy the skiing. Don't break anything important."

"Luc, get some rest. You've earned it."

"Ela, safe travels. I'm sure your sister will appreciate the help."

Jay watched with growing anticipation, his pulse quickening as Ian approached his desk. When Ian finally reached him, Jay got up and extended his hand.

"Merry Christmas, Jay. Thank you for your excellent work this year."

Their hands met in a firm handshake, and Jay felt an electric current run through the contact. Ian's grip was sure, his skin warm against Jay's palm. For a moment that stretched longer than it should have, neither man moved to break the connection.

"Thank you," Jay replied, his voice slightly breathless. "For everything. For giving me this opportunity."

Ian's eyes held his for a beat longer than necessary before he released Jay's hand. "You've more than earned your place here."

Jay felt heat rise in his face at the praise. "I'll see you soon," he said, gathering his things.

"Indeed. Enjoy your holiday, Jay."

The metro ride home felt dreamlike. Jay replayed the handshake over and over, the memory of Ian's touch lingering on his skin. He told himself he was reading too much into a simple gesture, but the flutter in his chest suggested otherwise.

Christmas was gray. Jay had slept late, luxuriating in the freedom from alarm clocks and schedules. He made coffee and sat by his small tree, watching the city wake up through his apartment window.

The cheese platter he assembled for lunch was a work of art—aged cheddar, creamy brie, and sharp blue cheese arranged on a wooden board with crackers and grapes. The wine he'd selected was rich and complex, far better than anything he'd ever purchased for himself.

"This is living," he said aloud, raising his glass to the empty apartment.

His phone rang as he was preparing dinner—a simple but elegant meal of herb-crusted salmon, roasted vegetables, and rice pilaf.

"Jay!" his mother's voice was bright with excitement. "I had to call and thank you for the gifts. You really shouldn't have."

"It's nothing, Mom. Just some things from work."

"The spa voucher is incredible. Your stepfather keeps complaining about it, but I caught him reading the brochure three times."

Jay laughed. "Tell him it's a company gift and I'm way too busy to use it myself. He'll have to suffer through a weekend of massages and gourmet meals."

"The kids love their presents too. Ema's been doing her eyes nonstop, and Ari has already assembled two of the vehicles."

They talked for another twenty minutes, his mother updating him on family matters. When they hung up, Jay felt a surge of affection free of the tension that plagued his relationship with his family lately.

The evening passed pleasantly. Jay opened another bottle of wine, savored his meal, and watched a Christmas movie on his laptop. The apartment felt cozy and warm, his small tree glowing in the corner.

He thought briefly about Ian, wondering how he was spending the evening, but pushed the thought away. Whatever Ian's holiday looked like, it wasn't Jay's concern.

Meanwhile, across the city, Ian sat in his pristine home office, reviewing reports that could easily have waited until January. His penthouse was elegant and spotless, unmarked by any hint of seasonal decoration. The only acknowledgement of the holiday was the expensive bottle of scotch he'd opened.

He worked through financial projections and client assessments, using the task to quiet his thoughts. The office would be closed for two days, but Ian had never seen much point in artificial celebrations.

Christmas had lost its meaning for him years ago, when his family's rejection had stripped away the warmth and tradition he'd once associated with the season. Now it was simply another date on the calendar, notable only for its inconvenience to business operations.

He paused in his work to refill his glass, thinking briefly about Jay's enthusiastic "see you soon" from the day before. The young man's obvious excitement about returning to work was both touching and puzzling. Ian couldn't remember the last time he'd looked forward to anything with such anticipation.

The memory of their handshake surfaced—Jay's palm warm against his, the brief moment of connection that had lasted a heartbeat too long. Ian forced the thought away and returned to his reports.

He worked until well past midnight, as he always did on Christmas Eve. The silence of his penthouse felt safe, unmarked by the messy emotions that holidays seemed to bring others.

As he finally prepared for bed, Ian caught sight of his reflection in the bathroom mirror. The man looking back at him appeared tired, someone who had forgotten how to feel the simple joy that had once made Christmas magical.

He doubted he would ever feel that kind of happiness again, the uncomplicated pleasure of anticipation and celebration. Those feelings belonged to a different version of himself, one that had disappeared along with his family's acceptance and his capacity for trust.

But somewhere in the city, Jay Hall was falling asleep with a smile on his face, content and already looking forward to returning to work. The contrast between their experiences would have struck Ian as poignant, if he'd allowed himself to consider it.

Instead, he simply turned off the lights and prepared for another day of productive solitude.

## Scene 5: Dream

Ian dreamed of warmth.

Jay's body pressed against his on the leather couch in his office, the younger man's gray eyes wide with wonder and an adoration that made Ian's chest tighten. Jay's hands trembled as they touched Ian's face, fingers mapping the angular planes of his features.

"I can't believe this is real," Jay whispered. "I can't believe you want me."

Ian cupped Jay's face, thumbs stroking across his pale cheeks. "Always," he murmured, drawing him closer. "From the moment you walked into my office."

Their lips met in a kiss that was tender and hesitant, Jay's mouth opening under his with a small sound of surprise. Ian kissed him slowly, savouring the sweetness, the way Jay melted against him with complete trust. Jay pulled Ian closer with desperate need.

"Please," Jay breathed against his lips. "I've wanted this for so long."

Ian's mouth moved to Jay's throat, pressing gentle kisses to the sensitive skin there. Jay's pulse raced under his lips, and Ian unbuttoned the top two buttons of Jay's shirt, revealing the pale column of his neck. Jay arched beneath him, trembling with want.

"Ian," Jay gasped, his voice breaking. "I'm so happy. I never thought... I never imagined you could feel this way about me."

Ian held him like something precious, something that might disappear if he gripped too tightly. Jay's skin was warm and smooth under his hands, and the sounds he made drove Ian to madness. This was everything he'd forbidden himself to want, everything he'd pushed away—

Ian's eyes snapped open.

His bedroom was dark and cold, the dream dissolving like smoke. His heart hammered against his ribs, and his breathing came in sharp, uneven gasps. The phantom sensation of Jay's mouth lingered on his lips, the memory of his weight in Ian's arms so vivid it felt like a physical loss.

Ian sat up, running his hands through his hair. The profound emptiness that followed the dream overwhelmed him. For a moment, he'd been happy—truly, completely happy—and now reality brutally crashed back.

He was alone. He was always alone.

Ian checked his phone. Three in the morning. The apartment felt suffocating, filled with the ghost of something he could never have.

He thought about how long it had been since he'd allowed anyone close. Years. He'd convinced himself that solitude was strength, that independence was safety. But apparently isolation was exacting its own price.

Jay's face rose in his mind—those wide gray eyes, the curve of his mouth. He was so beautiful that it made Ian's chest ache, sweet and honest and utterly untouchable.

Ian forced himself to stop. These thoughts were dangerous, useless. He couldn't start harbouring such fantasies about Jay. That path led only to pain—for both of them.

He grabbed his phone and scrolled to Leo's number. Leo had orchestrated this entire situation, bringing Jay into Ian's life with his meddling. Ian had tolerated it, but now he needed to express his displeasure properly.

The phone rang eleven times before Leo answered, his voice thick with sleep.

"Ian? Christ, what time is it? Is everything okay?"

"Tennis tomorrow. Nine o'clock."

"What? Ian, it's three in the morning. Are you drunk?"

"Nine o'clock," Ian repeated, his tone brooking no argument. "Don't be late."

"Are you out of your mind? It's the middle of the night, and it's December. The courts will be freezing."

"I don't care. I'll see you at nine."

Ian hung up before Leo could protest further.

The tennis courts were nearly empty on a gray December morning. Leo arrived looking disheveled and deeply annoyed, clutching a travel mug of coffee.

"This is insane," Leo muttered, stretching halfheartedly. "It's freezing out here. We're going to get frostbite."

Ian was already warming up. "You'll survive."

"What's gotten into you? You call me at three in the morning demanding tennis, and now you look like you want to murder someone."

"Serve," Ian commanded, taking his position.

Leo served weakly, still grumbling about the early hour. Ian returned the ball with viciousness, sending it flying past Leo's racket.

"Jesus, Ian! What was that?"

"Fifteen-love."

The next serve met the same fate. And the next. Within minutes, Leo was running frantically around the court, diving for shots that Ian accurately placed. Ian showed no mercy, driving Leo from corner to corner.

"This is torture," Leo gasped after losing the first set six games to love. "You're playing like you're trying to kill me."

"Second set," Ian replied, spinning his racket.

"Can we at least take a break? I'm dying here."

"We're playing."

Leo bent over his knees, breathing heavily. "This isn't tennis. This is some kind of sadistic punishment. What did I do?"

Ian's return shot nearly took Leo's head off. "You know what you did."

"I honestly don't! If this is about work, we can discuss it like civilized people over coffee."

Ian's next shot forced Leo to sprint to the baseline, where he stumbled and nearly fell. "This isn't about work."

"Then what?" Leo retrieved the ball and trudged back to the service line. "Did I forget your birthday? Insult your mother? Sleep with your imaginary boyfriend?" Leo paused, racket halfway through his serving motion. "Is it about Jay?"

Ian's look could have frozen water.

"He's doing great work, everyone likes him, he's fitting in perfectly. What's the problem?"

Ian's return shot landed inches from Leo's feet. "The problem is your meddling."

"My meddling?" Leo's voice rose to a squeak. "You mean hiring him? You approved that!"

"I approved hiring an assistant. I didn't approve hiring..." Ian paused, searching for words that wouldn't reveal too much. "Someone like him."

"Someone like what? Competent? Hardworking? Good-looking?"

Ian's racket connected with the ball so hard it sounded like a gunshot. Leo dove sideways, barely avoiding being hit.

"Are you trying to kill me?"

"Keep playing."

They continued for another hour, Leo growing increasingly bedraggled while Ian maintained his ruthless pace. By the time they finished, Leo looked like he'd been through a blender.

"Three hours," Leo gasped, collapsing onto a bench. "Three hours of this torture. I can't feel my legs."

Ian toweled off his face, his expression still severe. "Perhaps you'll think twice before your next scheme."

"What scheme? I hired you an assistant! A good assistant! He's perfect for the job!"

"That's the problem."

Leo stared at him for a long moment, understanding dawning in his eyes. "Oh. Oh, Ian. You like him. Actually like him. And it's freaking you out."

Ian's expression went glacial. "Don't be ridiculous."

"That's why you're punishing me with arctic tennis at the crack of dawn. You're attracted to your assistant and you're blaming me for it."

"I'm not attracted to anyone."

"Right. And that's why you just spent three hours trying to murder me with a tennis ball."

"This conversation is over."

"Ian, wait." Leo struggled to his feet. "Look, I know you're scared. After Sam, I understand why you don't trust—"

"Don't." Ian's voice was deadly quiet. "Don't mention Sam. And don't pretend you understand anything about my situation."

"I'm just saying, maybe it's time to consider that not everyone is out to hurt you."

Ian shouldered his bag and walked toward the exit. "Thank you for the tennis match, Leo. It was exactly what I needed."

"Ian!"

But Ian was already gone, leaving Leo standing alone on the frozen court, with bruised ego and aching muscles.

As Ian drove home, he felt marginally better. The physical exertion had burned off some of his restless energy, and Leo's suffering had provided a satisfying outlet for his frustration. But the underlying problem remained. Jay would be back at work tomorrow, with his earnest eyes and his gentle smile, and Ian would have to pretend that everything was exactly as it should be.
