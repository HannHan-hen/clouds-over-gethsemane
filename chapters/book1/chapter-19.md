# Chapter 19: Family
## Scene 1
Mundane tasks
June traditionally marked the beginning of the company's slower season. With most major projects completed before summer and new initiatives postponed until autumn, the office operated at a more leisurely pace. Jay's colleagues spent lunch breaks discussing vacation plans, senior partners left early for weekend trips, and the general atmosphere was relaxed.
For Jay, who had no vacation plans beyond visiting his family for his half-sister's graduation, the quieter schedule created opportunities to tackle projects he had never found time to address during busier periods.
The heatwave had also reignited the old lunch debate with fresh urgency. The team's restaurant rotation faced harsh scrutiny based on air conditioning quality.
"I'm not walking fifteen minutes in this heat just for mediocre pasta," Amy declared during Tuesday's lunch planning session.
"The seafood place has excellent cooling. Even if their service has gotten slower lately." Ela suggested. 
Kim, notorious for prioritizing interesting food over convenience, looked pained as several of his favourite establishments were eliminated from consideration due to inadequate climate control. "The hotpot place makes the best pickled cabbage in the district, but their AC sounds like a dying helicopter."
"Proper cooling beats culinary adventure when it's forty degrees outside," Max replied.
Kim grudgingly agreed that surviving the heat took precedence over gastronomic exploration.
When most of the team departed by six o'clock, Jay remained at his workstation to reorganize the department's filing system. The cabinets had been sorted chronologically for years—a system that made sense when Turner & Associates handled fewer clients but had become increasingly unwieldy as their business expanded.
Ian had mentioned the need for alphabetical reorganization months earlier, describing it as "non-urgent but eventually necessary." June's calm provided the perfect opportunity to tackle such administrative improvements.
Jay pulled files from their current locations, sorted them by client name, and created new folder tabs. The work required little creative energy, making it ideal for the languid summer evenings when his mind felt pleasantly unfocused.
"Working on the filing project?" Ian asked, emerging from his office.
"Almost finished with the G section. Should have the whole system converted by Friday," Jay replied, looking up from his neat piles of documents.
Ian approached the filing cabinets to examine Jay's progress. The new organization was immediately apparent—clear labels, easy accessibility for future reference.
"This looks excellent. Much more practical than what we had before."
"The old system probably made sense when you had twenty clients instead of two hundred," Jay said, and paused as he realized the comment might come across as presumptuous.
"It made sense when I first started here. Less effective once we began hiring groups of people to manage the growing workload. Personally, I preferred the chronological order, but I was in the minority."
The gentle self-deprecation surprised Jay, who was used to Ian's more formal way of speaking. "So you’re saying you’ve sacrificed your own preference for the greater good?"
"I'm saying alphabetical order is superior to my personal filing instincts." Ian replied with obvious amusement.
Jay returned to his sorting with a smile, enjoying the unexpected lightness in their exchange. The banter felt natural, as if some invisible barrier had finally dissolved completely.
Later that week, Jay had ventured to the nearby park in the afternoon, discovered during his anxious first month at Turner & Associates. The small green space included a gourmet ice cream cart that served artisanal flavours created for people with adventurous tastes. After studying the handwritten menu board, he selected parsnip ice cream—an unusual choice that intrigued him precisely because it seemed so unexpected.
The flavour was interesting, with sweetness balanced by earthy undertones that challenged his preconceptions about frozen desserts. Jay ate it slowly on a park bench, watching office workers seek shade under the limited tree cover.
When he finally walked back to Northlight Financial Center, the contrast between the oppressive outdoor heat and the building's climate control felt like entering a sanctuary. The pleasure of that transition made him appreciate the comfort he was returning to even more.
These small explorations of the neighbourhood during quieter periods had become part of Jay's expanded routine. With fewer urgent tasks demanding immediate attention, he allowed himself brief escapes that would have been impossible during the intense winter months.
His summer activities extended beyond filing systems and visiting local ice cream vendors. Jay typically completed all tasks during evening hours, processing emails as they arrived and ensuring that nothing awaited his attention the following morning. That left his morning hours free for other, less pressing matters, like learning how the administrative departments functioned, consulting with staff about office supply purchases and kitchen inventory, understanding how the archives and print room operated.
His explorations remained deliberately unobtrusive—he made sure to schedule visits during natural breaks in departmental workflows and avoided areas containing sensitive information. The goal was understanding how Turner & Associates functioned as an integrated system beyond just his immediate sphere of responsibility.
Jay had also familiarized himself with other departments' client portfolios, reading case summaries and learning about investment strategies that fell outside his direct responsibilities. The knowledge wasn't immediately useful, but it provided context that made him more effective when handling cross-departmental communications.
During quieter moments of the day, Jay studied the advanced prognostic models that Max and Amy typically designed and maintained. The mathematical frameworks challenged his comprehension limits, but persistent effort gradually revealed the elegant logic underlying their complexity. He took notes, flagging areas for future research.
He had acquired a nice leather-bound notebook specifically to organize his growing knowledge about the firm’s practical operations. Relying on loose pads and scattered post-its had started to become troublesome, and he needed a better system. One section of the notebook was dedicated to the intricacies of the models, another detailed the specific responsibilities assigned to each team member. At this time, he focused particularly on hounding Kim for details, since Kim’s annual absence was rarely covered properly due to the wide range of duties he handled.
The economics textbook he had brought to the office earlier now showed signs of serious study, with pages marked with additional notes. Jay had supplemented it with a more challenging text on international finance theory, working through complex analyses during long evenings.
As the Friday evening stretched toward eight o'clock, Jay completed his filing project. Ian was in his office and remained visible through his open door, apparently in no hurry to leave despite having no pressing deadlines.
"All finished. Future researchers will be able to locate materials without developing new theories about the filing philosophy," Jay announced.
"Your organizational skills continue to impress me. Though I have to ask—don't you have better ways to spend your evenings than reorganizing inherited filing disasters?"
"Staying here until the temperature drops feels more pleasant than slowly melting at home. And I like having projects to work on."
Jay returned to his workstation and opened his advanced economics textbook to a chapter on currency stabilization mechanisms. Ian looked up from his work and caught Jay's glance, offering a brief smile that Jay returned automatically. Such moments of connection had become more frequent since the retreat, small acknowledgements of their shared evenings that felt personal.
"Good chapter?" Ian asked.
"Challenging but interesting. International currency policy turns out to be more complex than I originally understood."
When they finally headed for the exit, the building's lobby was nearly empty except for security staff preparing for the overnight shift. Outside, the evening heat remained oppressive despite the late hour, creating visible waves of distortion above the pavement.
"See you on Monday," Jay said as they parted ways.
"Have a good evening. Try to stay cool."
The filing project was complete, but Jay had already identified other administrative improvements that could benefit from attention during the next week. His expanded understanding of the company's operations revealed numerous opportunities for optimization that nobody else had time to pursue.
## Scene 2
The Family Visit
Jay picked up the company car Thursday evening, planning to leave early Friday morning for Ema's graduation. He checked the parking space number twice before accepting what he was seeing. In his designated spot sat what could only be described as a limousine. He checked the license plate against his paperwork, then pressed the key fob. The car's lights flashed in response, leaving no room for doubt.
Jay stared at the pristine interior, the leather seats, the glowing dashboard. In retrospect, he should have expected this. Turner & Associates wasn't the type of company to maintain a fleet of economy cars. But the reality of driving something worth more than his apartment was intimidating.
He drove it home with extreme caution, terrified about leaving it parked on the street overnight. Fortunately, his neighborhood was safe, and he found a spot directly under a streetlight where he could see it from his window.
Jay spent the evening on meticulous preparation. He packed his suitcase, laid out everything he'd need, and prepared food for the morning. The graduation ceremony started at two, which meant leaving by eight to account for traffic and arrival time.
Choosing an outfit had been surprisingly complicated. His closet was now full of expensive clothing, but most of it was business wear. He no longer owned casual clothes appropriate for a family gathering, but showing up in a suit seemed too formal for his siblings' middle school graduation.
Eventually he'd decided on the designer pieces from his winter shopping emergency at Hathaway's that he never worn since purchasing them. The combination was more extravagant than anything he'd owned a year ago, but at least it wasn't obviously corporate. 
He could have chosen some of the resort casual wear he'd recently bought, comfortable pieces that would have been perfectly appropriate for a family gathering. But those exquisite items were too expensive to leave hanging in his closet unused, so he figured this was a good enough occasion to wear them. A family function seemed safe enough—he didn't need to worry about attracting unwanted attention. If he was going to wear these beautiful pieces anywhere, this was as good an opportunity as any.
He'd also visited his usual hairdresser for a fresh cut, the same stylist who prepared him for company events. Looking in the mirror Friday morning, he had to admit the overall effect was quite polished.
The drive started smoothly, but Jay quickly discovered he'd underestimated Friday morning traffic during summer. Cars moved at a crawl through the city, and what should have been a four-hour journey threatened to stretch much longer. By ten-thirty, he was texting his mother that he'd go straight to the school instead of stopping at home first. Speeding was obviously out of the question.
He arrived at Ema's school with minutes to spare, parking the deluxe sedan among modest family cars and immediately regretting his choice of vehicle. The contrast was stark. His car looked like it belonged to a celebrity, not someone attending family function.
The effect on Ema's classmates was immediate and dramatic. As Jay walked toward the school entrance, he heard whispers and saw phones being pulled out for photos. He felt conspicuous, and it made him deeply uncomfortable.
"Jay!" Ema's voice cut through the crowd, and suddenly she was running toward him.
"Hey. Congratulations," he said, accepting her enthusiastic hug.
"Oh my God, you look amazing! Is that your car? That's your car, isn't it? This is so cool!"
Before Jay could explain that it was a company vehicle, Ema was dragging him toward her friends, who had clustered nearby with phones ready.
"This is my brother Jay," she announced proudly. "He works in high finance in the city. He's basically like a investment banker or something."
Jay tried to correct her, but she was already posing for selfies and posting to social media with captions about her "successful big city brother." 
The graduation ceremony proceeded smoothly. Ema's cheerleading performance was energetic and well-executed, and Jay applauded enthusiastically from his seat with the family. But even during the formal proceedings, he noticed other parents glancing in his direction, clearly curious about the well-dressed young man who'd arrived in the limousine.
Back at the house for the celebratory dinner, Jay completely overshadowed Ema's actual achievement. She asked questions about the financial world, clearly imagining his job as something far more glamorous than it actually was. Even her performance, which she'd been so proud of earlier, became a secondary topic of conversation.
"Do you work with like, really rich people?" she asked over dessert.
"Sometimes, but I'm really just-"
"That's so cool! Do you have to wear suits every day? Is your office in one of those huge skyscrapers?"
His attempts to downplay his role were futile, especially after he presented gifts to his siblings—vouchers to stores he thought they'd enjoy, meant to mark the end of the school year and serve as birthday presents. Their excitement over the amounts only reinforced their perception of his success. 
"You didn't have to do this," his mother said quietly, but Jay could see she was pleased by his generosity toward the other children.
"I wanted to," Jay replied honestly. "It's not often I get to celebrate with everyone."
Tim was fascinated by the car. "Can we see the inside? Does it have like, a sound system?"
Even Ari, usually shy, was drawn into the excitement, asking if Jay had his own office and whether he'd ever been on television.
Jay's mother watched the proceedings with obvious pride, though she seemed content to let her younger children monopolize his attention. The other relatives who'd come for the graduation treated him with a deference that felt strange and unearned.
Saturday was even more overwhelming. Ema had apparently made promises to her friends, because she appeared at breakfast with a detailed plan for Jay to drive them around the town and accompany them shopping.
"I can't just drive a company car around for entertainment," Jay protested.
"But you said it was okay to use for personal needs!"
"For necessary personal needs. Not joyrides."
"Please? My friends will die if they don't get to ride in it. And you never come home anyway."
The guilt trip worked, largely because Jay couldn't argue with the accusation about never visiting.
"It's not actually a limo," he tried to explain as Ema and three friends piled into the back seat.
"It's close enough," Ema replied dismissively. "My friends think you're basically like those investment bankers in movies."
They spent the morning at a shopping center where Ema used her cosmetics voucher, testing products and consulting with her friends about color choices. Jay followed at a distance, mostly trying to blend into the background.
Lunch at a nice restaurant impressed the teenagers even more, especially when Jay insisted on paying despite their halfhearted protests about using their allowances.
"So you don't make deals worth millions every day?" one of Ema's friends asked, sounding disappointed.
"No, I mostly organize meetings and handle correspondence."
"But you work with people who make such deals?"
"Well, yes, but-"
"That's so cool!"
The afternoon was devoted to his brothers' shopping expeditions. Ari's toy store adventure was relatively straightforward, though he kept asking Jay's opinion about various electronic games and building sets. Tim's outdoor equipment shopping was more complex, involving lengthy discussions about sleeping bag temperature ratings and backpack features.
Between the shopping trips and general driving around, Jay committed to staying until Sunday instead of leaving Saturday evening as originally planned. The siblings had claimed so much of his attention that he'd barely interacted with the other relatives who'd come for the celebration, including several aunts and uncles he hadn't seen in years.
He'd slept cramped in Ari's narrow bed while Ari bunked with their parents, since the house was full of visiting relatives. The accommodations were uncomfortable, but Jay didn't mind. It felt familiar and comforting.
When he finally prepared to leave Sunday afternoon, his mother walked him to the car, holding a small wrapped package.
"Your birthday's coming up, and I know you won't be able to visit again soon," she said, pressing the gift into his hands. "I'm so proud of what you've accomplished, Jay. You've really made something of yourself in the city."
"Mom, I'm just an assistant. It's not as impressive as everyone thinks."
She smiled, the same patient expression she'd worn when he was small and trying to deflect praise. "You look successful, honey. Whatever you're doing, it's working for you."
Jay accepted the gift and her assessment, knowing that further protests would be futile. In their eyes, he'd transformed from a struggling young man into someone worthy of admiration, and perhaps that wasn't entirely wrong.
The drive home was peaceful, with light Sunday traffic making for an easy journey. Jay felt drained but happy. The weekend had been tiring, but seeing his family's pride and excitement had been worth the exhaustion.
Back in his studio, Jay unpacked his mother's gift. Inside was a collection of photos from the weekend—candid shots of him with his siblings, including several where Ema and the boys were literally hanging off his arms, all of them grinning broadly. There was also a package of rare spices, the kind that reminded him of his grandfather and had always fascinated him, even though his cooking skills remained basic.
Looking at the photos, Jay had to admit he looked happy despite the chaos of the weekend. The designer clothes created an image of success that wasn't entirely false, even if it wasn't the whole truth either. His siblings' obvious affection and pride in his achievements made him feel warm inside.
The spices were a thoughtful touch that showed his mother still remembered small details about his preferences, even after years of limited contact.
The visit had been more intense than expected, but it had also been surprisingly affirming. Maybe he really had made it further than he'd realized.
## Scene 3
Photos
Jay selected the best photo from his mother's collection and placed it in a discreet corner of his desk Monday morning. The image captured a perfect moment, him looking great in his designer clothes, with Ema hanging from one arm while he patted Ari's hair with his free hand, and Tim lurking behind him, already taller than Jay despite being the younger brother. Everyone was smiling, and the photo radiated uncomplicated joy that made good memories.
When Ian arrived and spotted the new addition to Jay's workspace, he paused at Jay's desk.
"How was the graduation?"
"Really good. Ema was thrilled. She performed with the cheerleading squad, and everything went well. The whole family was there, aunts, uncles, cousins. It was quite the production."
"And your siblings? How are they adjusting to having their successful older brother visit?"
The question felt specific, but Jay answered readily. "They were excited. Maybe a bit too excited. I ended up staying an extra day because they wanted to show me off to their friends."
"Show you off?"
Jay felt heat creep up his neck. "The car made quite an impression. And apparently I look more successful than I feel. Ema spent the entire weekend bragging to her friends about her brother in finance."
"I see. That must have been gratifying."
"Embarrassing, mostly. But nice, I suppose."
Ian's questions continued beyond polite inquiry. "How was he drive? No problems with the vehicle? Where did you stay overnight?"
Jay happily narrated the weekend's events, describing the family dinner and his siblings' excitement about their gifts. Ian listened patiently, though Jay began to feel slightly sheepish about monopolizing his boss's time with personal stories.
"I'm probably talking too much," Jay said eventually. "I know you have work to get to."
"It's fine. I'm glad the visit went well."
Throughout the morning, Jay's colleagues stopped by his desk to admire the family photo. The image sparked conversations about summer plans and upcoming vacations, which gradually became the dominant topic around the office.
"What about you, Jay? Any holiday plans?" Amy asked during their coffee break.
"Not really. I'll probably take time off when Ian does," Jay said.
This prompted general laughter from the group.
"Ian hasn't taken a real vacation in three years. The last time was practically forced by Turner senior when he threatened to lock Ian out of the building," Max informed him.
"Three years?" Jay repeated, feeling that familiar worry about Ian's work habits.
"He's hopeless. We've all given up trying to convince him to take breaks," Ela added.
Jay made a mental note to revisit this topic later, though he wasn't sure what he could possibly do to influence Ian's vacation schedule.
That afternoon, his phone rang with Ema's name appearing on the screen.
"Jay! You have to send me tons of photos from your office and the city. My friends are obsessed with your whole finance life now."
"I can send some photos, but I don't really take many pictures at work."
"Then start! And you absolutely need to get social media so I can tag you in things. It's so embarrassing that my successful older brother doesn't even have an account."
Jay felt uncomfortable at the suggestion. "I've never had social media accounts. I wouldn't know what to do with them."
"Everyone has social media, Jay. How do you even exist without it?"
"Quite peacefully."
After some negotiation, he agreed to take more photos but held firm on the social media issue. Ema wasn't entirely satisfied, but accepted the compromise.
Tuesday morning, Jay arrived at seven-thirty to find the office empty. This seemed like the perfect opportunity to attempt the photography Ema had demanded. He started with awkward selfies that showed nothing useful, then tried setting up his phone with a makeshift timer, but the results were terrible.
He was crouched behind his desk, trying to position his phone against a stack of books, when he heard footsteps. Ian appeared earlier than usual, taking in the scene with what looked like alarm.
"What are you doing?"
"I was just... my sister wanted photos of the office. Is that not allowed? I didn't think about whether it might be inappropriate..." Jay stammered, suddenly worried he'd broken some rule about photographing company premises.
He held up his phone awkwardly, as if to show evidence of his innocent intentions. The camera roll displayed his terrible attempts at office photography—blurry shots of his desk, an accidental close-up of the ceiling, and one particularly unfortunate image of his chin.
"These are quite possibly the worst photos I've ever seen," Ian said, and Jay caught the hint of suppressed laughter in his voice.
"I know. I have no idea what I'm doing."
"Sit down. I'll take proper photos."
"You don't have to do that."
"Apparently I do, unless you want to send your sister evidence that you work in a blurry, incomprehensible dimension."
Ian's photography skills were immediately apparent. He composed shots that made Jay's workspace look impressive, captured the office's elegant atmosphere, and even managed a few images that showed the city view from their floor.
"One more," Ian said, then surprised Jay by positioning himself in the frame for a selfie. "Your sister will want proof that you have colleagues."
The selfie turned out surprisingly well, both of them looking poised, the office's sophisticated backdrop clearly visible. Jay stared at the image with delight.
"This is perfect. Thank you so much for helping with this."
"It's nothing."
Jay looked at Ian's other photos, shaking his head in amazement. "How are you good at everything?"
"I'm not good at everything."
"Name one thing you're not good at."
Ian paused, seeming to consider seriously. "I can't think of anything immediately."
Jay threw him an exaggerated look of despair. "It's not fair. Some of us have to work at being competent."
"I'm sure you have talents I lack."
"Like what?"
"You're much better at making people comfortable. That's not a skill I possess naturally."
The compliment caught Jay off guard, and he felt warmth spread through his chest. "Thank you. And thank you for helping with the photos. Ema's going to be thrilled."
"You're welcome."
The rest of the morning proceeded normally, but Jay treasured the unexpected selfie with Ian. He had other photos of them together from company events, but those felt impersonal, formal shots taken by photographers at business functions. This candid image felt different.
He sent Ema the best photos as promised, receiving an immediate barrage of enthusiastic responses about the office's glamour and how impressive everything looked. But privately, Jay kept returning to the selfie, wondering if it would be presumptuous to print it and put it on his refrigerator alongside the family photo from graduation weekend.
Meanwhile, Ian sat at his desk feeling deeply unsettled by his own behavior. The moment when he'd first seen Jay with the camera had triggered an immediate spike of paranoia, memories of Sam Connelly's corporate espionage attempts flooding back. But Jay's obviously innocent photo attempts had quickly dissolved those fears, leaving Ian feeling guilty for doubting him even momentarily.
Ian forced himself to confront an uncomfortable realization: he was becoming more concerned about accidentally hurting Jay than about protecting himself. The shift in priorities should have alarmed him, but instead it felt inevitable, as if he'd been moving toward this point without conscious recognition.
More troubling was his willingness to help with the photography. He was actively participating in Jay's personal life, making himself available far beyond what supervisory duties required.
He was in dangerous territory, and he knew it. But every interaction with Jay made it harder to maintain the emotional distance he'd once considered essential for his own safety.
Jay's happiness about the photos, his affection for his family, his concern about office policies, everything about him showed authenticity that Ian found increasingly difficult to question. And his own responses to Jay were becoming harder to rationalize.
## Scene 4
Holiday season
The leisurely pace of June vanished overnight as the second quarter drew to its official close. July started with the urgency of quarterly reporting season, turning Turner & Associates into a finely tuned machine operating at maximum capacity.
Jay had grown accustomed to the extended evening hours, but the expanded workload felt jarring after weeks of self-directed projects. His role during quarterly reporting remained peripheral to the actual document creation, but his supporting responsibilities expanded during these intensive periods. He handled formatting for multiple document types, managed extensive copy-paste operations, and proofread materials that would eventually reach regulatory authorities and clients.
The compliance and audit departments seemed particularly active this quarter, their increased scrutiny apparently related to recent regulatory changes that Jay didn't fully understand but whose effects rippled through every aspect of their reporting process. His days filled with correspondence between various departments, scheduling meetings, and ensuring that documentation met increasingly specific requirements.
"New regulations always create chaos for the first few cycles. Everyone interprets requirements slightly differently until precedent gets established," Max explained.
Jay nodded while mentally adding another item to his growing list of processes to research once the immediate crisis passed. The regulatory landscape remained largely mysterious to him, but each quarterly cycle revealed more about how external requirements shaped their internal operations.
The suspended lunch trips felt less painful given the oppressive heat outside. Nobody complained about living on takeout when the alternative involved venturing into temperatures that made short walks feel like endurance tests. The office kitchen received heavy use as everyone adapted to eating meals that could be delivered directly to their climate-controlled sanctuary.
Amid the frenzy of quarterly reporting, Jay received his second quarterly bonus. The bank transfer notification appeared in his account, leaving Jay once again staring at his bank statement in disbelief. The company's compensation structure continued to remain needlessly opaque.
The HR documentation remained as cryptic as ever—a lengthy list of components beyond his base salary that included items like "CFO Desk Premium," "Monthly Operations Supplement," and "Discretionary Quarterly Float." His previous job had straightforward simplicity—base salary plus occasional small bonuses tied to specific performance metrics. Turner & Associates operated according to more complex principles.
Jay had initially assumed the bonuses might be temporary or conditional, but their consistent appearance indicated they were integral to the company's compensation philosophy. The amounts were big enough to impact his financial stability. He didn't even want to contemplate the annual bonuses, given that last year's had been large enough to completely revolutionize his understanding of personal finance and fund his designer wardrobe experiments.
"The bonus system shows Leo's approach to employee retention. He believes in paying well enough that people don't want to leave," Amy had explained during a conversation. 
The approach seemed to work effectively. Jay certainly had no desire to leave Turner & Associates, though his motivation extended far beyond financial considerations.
As the chaotic first week finally concluded, the holiday season began in earnest, and the office began to empty in waves. Kim and Ela had suspiciously coordinated their schedules to take two weeks off at the same time, which nobody mentioned directly but everyone noticed.
The reduced staffing meant that remaining team members needed to absorb additional responsibilities, particularly in areas where specialized knowledge was required. Jay covered duties he had never handled independently, armed with the detailed notes Kim had provided during June's slower period.
"Database maintenance isn't complicated once you understand the method. But if something goes wrong, don't try to fix it yourself. Call the IT department immediately,"  Kim had explained during one of their June training sessions.
Jay's notebook contained five pages of instructions for handling Kim's more straightforward tasks, complete with contact information for various specialists and step-by-step procedures for common problems. The preparation was invaluable as Jay handled duties that would have previously required IT intervention.
The additional workload felt manageable, partly because of Kim's preparation and partly because Jay had grown more comfortable with expanding his role when circumstances demanded flexibility. He had learned prepare solutions in advance and escalate issues appropriately when they exceeded his expertise.
The rest of the team had various leave scheduled throughout the upcoming two months, creating the seasonal coverage challenges that Jay was already anticipating. Max was planning another of his eccentric adventures to somewhere hot and unpopular, prompting a chorus of warnings about exotic foods and extended hospital stays.
"Remember last year when you disappeared for two months after eating that fish thing?" Amy reminded him during one of their morning coffee breaks.
"It was a valuable cultural experience," Max replied.
"It was food poisoning that nearly required medical evacuation."
"I was only unreachable for three weeks. And the food poisoning was completely unrelated to my travel choices."
"You couldn't walk properly for a month," Amy reminded him.
"Character building," Max replied cheerfully.
Luc had organized a backpacking trip with his girlfriend for August, while Amy's family vacation with her husband and daughters was scheduled for later in July. Zoe's two-week scuba diving expedition generated considerable excitement from Jay, who kept asking her with questions about locations, certification requirements, and equipment.
"You should really try those beginner classes I mentioned. You seemed to enjoy it at the retreat," Zoe said.
"I'm seriously considering it." 
The vacation discussions inevitably led to Ian calling Jay into his office later that week.
"You haven't submitted your leave request yet," Ian observed, consulting a staffing calendar.
"I'll take my leave when you do," Jay replied matter-of-factly.
Ian looked up sharply. "That's not how vacation scheduling works."
"I’m your assistant. It's how mine works."
"Jay, you need to take time off. It's not optional."
"I agree completely. We both need to take time off."
"I don't take extended vacations."
"I know. That's why I'm not taking mine either."
"That's... manipulative."
"Maybe a little. I'm not trying to be difficult. I just think we both need breaks, and if my schedule depends on yours, perhaps you'll reconsider your approach to time off."
Ian was caught between irritation and grudging respect for Jay's strategy. "You can't just refuse to take vacation because I don't."
"I'm not refusing. I'm scheduling mine to coincide with yours."
"I'm not planning any time off."
"Then neither am I."
They reached an impasse that left Ian clearly frustrated but unwilling to directly order Jay to submit vacation requests. Jay could see him calculating options and finding them all unsatisfactory.
"We'll revisit this," Ian said finally.
"Of course."
Jay left the meeting feeling slightly guilty but confident that his point had been made. Ian's work habits were concerning, and if a little strategic stubbornness could prompt him to take a break, the ends justified the means.
The holiday season was just beginning, and Jay was curious to see whether his gambit would work. Either Ian would order him to take vacation anyway, or he would finally be forced to consider his own need for rest and recovery.
Jay was committed to his position now. Ian's well-being felt more important than his own desire for a beach holiday, and if his mild manipulation succeeded in getting Ian to take care of himself, the gamble would be worth it.

## Scene 5
Ambience
The quarterly party provided a welcome distraction from office realities. Turner & Associates had opted for an outdoor evening event to accommodate the summer weather, complete with elegant torches creating atmospheric lighting around the garden venue. String lights draped between architectural elements created constellations against the dusky sky, turning the place into something magical.
 Jay wore his new summer suit in light earthy tones, feeling pleasantly unremarkable for once. The muted colours made him blend into the background, which improved his mood. He stood near the bar, holding a glass of wine and observing the smaller-than-usual gathering. The holiday season had claimed several team members—Kim and Ela absent on their synchronized vacation, Max had taken Friday off to extend a family weekend, and most departments showed similar gaps in attendance.
"Smaller crowd this quarter," Luc commented, joining Jay at his observation point.
"I like it better this way. Less overwhelming."
"The food is excellent."
"The shrimp appetizers were great," Jay agreed.
"And the weather cooperated perfectly. These outdoor events are always risky, but tonight turned out ideal. Leo's in full hosting mode. He gets really excited about these events. Probably the only time he gets to show off his party planning skills."
Jay smiled while strategically positioning himself to maintain distance from Leo. Their interactions remained cordial, but Jay preferred to avoid him altogether.
"Speaking of which, have you noticed our missing colleagues' vacation timing?" Luc continued.
"You mean the fact that Kim and Ela are both mysteriously unavailable for exactly the same two weeks?"
"What a remarkable coincidence."
Jay sipped his drink, enjoying the diplomatic gossip. "I mean, they did seem very comfortable with each other at the concert. Think they'll make it official when they get back?"
"Depends how their mysterious simultaneous vacation goes. Either they'll come back together or they'll never speak again."  
"That's rather dramatic."  
"Office relationships usually are. High stakes, limited privacy, everyone watching for developments."  
Jay felt a slight chill despite the warm evening air. "Sounds complicated."  
"Very. Probably why most people avoid them entirely."
"What's the official stance on office relationships anyway?" Jay asked.
Luc's expression became more serious. "No official policy beyond the usual chain-of-command restrictions. But everyone knows it's risky business. Things can get complicated quickly."
"Complicated how?"
"Breakups affect team dynamics. Favouritism accusations. Liability issues. Why do you ask?"
"Just curious about how these things work."
"My advice? The complications aren't worth it, no matter how attractive the person might be."
Jay nodded, absorbing this information. "That makes sense. Keep things separate."
"Exactly. Much more prudent."
The conversation moved on to safer topics, but Jay thought about the complexities of workplace relationships for the rest of the evening. His attention occasionally drifted to where Ian was engaged in discussion with Turner senior and several board members. Even at social events, Ian maintained focus, though Jay noticed he looked more relaxed in the outdoor setting.
After an hour of socializing, Jay gravitated toward a quieter corner of the venue. A small fountain provided gentle background sound, the water catching the light from nearby torches and creating shifting patterns of illumination. Stone benches arranged around the fountain offered refuge from the main party area without completely isolating him from the celebration.
He sat on one of the benches, appreciating the moment of relative solitude. The party continued behind him, but the fountain's peaceful ambience created a buffer that made the sounds feel distant.
"Hiding from the festivities?"
Jay looked up to find Ian approaching, holding a glass of wine and wearing an expression of mild amusement.
"Just enjoying the ambience," Jay replied, gesturing toward the fountain and torchlit surroundings. "It's beautiful here."
"Leo has excellent taste in venues, whatever his other faults," Ian said as he sat on the bench beside him.
Jay looked up at the strings of lights draped throughout the garden, their warm glow creating patterns of light and shadow. "I love the lighting decoration. The garlands of lights glittering everywhere make it feel like a fairy tale setting."
Ian followed his gaze upward, his expression more critical. "It's rather gaudy."
"I think it's lovely. The lights create exactly the right atmosphere for an evening celebration."
"Perhaps you're right. It does suit the garden setting, even if it's not my preference."
Their conversation drifted to other topics—the successful completion of the quarterly reports, upcoming projects that would begin after the holiday season, general observations about their colleagues and the evening's festivities. 
"Speaking of upcoming plans," Ian said eventually, "you still haven't submitted your holiday request. Disregard my schedule and choose dates that work for you."
"I honestly don't have specific plans that require particular timing."
"No travel arrangements? Personal commitments that would benefit from extended time off?"
"Not really. I rarely even leave the city for holidays. A few days off here and there suit me perfectly."
"Jay, you've been working here for a year. You've earned vacation time, and you should use it for something more meaningful than staying home in the city."
"I'm content with my current approach to time off. Not everyone needs elaborate vacation plans."
Ian looked like he wanted to argue further but seemed to recognize the futility of the discussion. Jay had clearly thought about his vacation preferences and reached conclusions that differed from Ian's expectations.
"At least consider taking a full week at some point. Even if you spend it entirely in your apartment, the complete break from work can be refreshing."
"I'll think about it," Jay promised, meaning it sincerely even though he suspected his thinking wouldn't lead to dramatically different choices.
The party continued around them as evening deepened into night, the torch lights becoming more prominent as natural light faded. Their conversation continued comfortably—touching on various topics without particular agenda, simply two people who had grown to enjoy each other's company sharing observations about their work and their world.
Eventually, Ian got up with obvious reluctance. "I should circulate more. Leo will notice if I spend the entire evening hiding in corners."
"Of course. Can't have people thinking you're antisocial."
"Exactly. My reputation as a charming conversationalist depends on making appearances."
As Ian left, Jay remained by the fountain, trailing his fingers in the cool water, content with his solitude and the peaceful atmosphere. He wasn't nervous about company social events anymore, but he still appreciated moments of quiet, especially in settings as beautiful as this garden.
He eventually returned to the buffet for another sampling of the excellent food, exchanged pleasantries with various colleagues, and enjoyed the relaxed social atmosphere.
When it felt appropriate, Jay left the party and headed home, content with his life’s current trajectory. It felt extraordinarily good to be alive, to be part of something meaningful, and to have found his place in a world that had once seemed impossibly foreign.
