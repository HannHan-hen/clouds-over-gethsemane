# Chapter 13: Ides of March
## Scene 1
Lunch discord
March came with the promise of spring that never materialized. The temperatures had crept up enough to melt most of the snow, but what remained was a persistent chill accompanied by dampness that seemed to seep through every layer of clothing. Gray skies stretched endlessly overhead, broken only by intermittent drizzle that made every outdoor excursion feel like a calculated risk.
The team had begun to cautiously revive their daily walks to nearby restaurants for lunch, venturing out whenever the weather and workload permitted. The outings had been on hold for weeks, because of heavy snow and mounting deadlines, and while neither had improved much, the conditions were tolerable enough, and everyone was tired of takeout eaten at their desks.
Jay still had lingering congestion and his voice held traces of hoarseness. His first week back, he avoided the lunch expeditions entirely, choosing instead sandwiches from the bakery he had discovered during those December days when he and Luc had eaten in the office kitchen.
The sandwiches were substantial—thick slices of fresh bread filled with quality meats and vegetables that made them feel like proper meals. Jay ate at his workspace, reluctant to test his recovering immune system against March's unpredictable weather.
"You sure you don't want to join us?" Luc asked on Wednesday, pulling on his jacket. "We're just going around the corner."
"I think I'll stick with staying dry today," Jay replied, unwrapping his turkey and swiss. "The cold air might trigger another coughing fit. Maybe next week when I'm feeling completely back to normal."
By his second week, Jay felt ready to rejoin the team's lunch outings, but he quickly discovered that the winter's isolation had affected more than just his health. The carefree atmosphere that had characterized their group outings before his illness had developed fractures that exposed everyone's frayed nerves.
"Where are we thinking today?" Amy asked on Monday, checking the weather app on her phone with visible frustration.
"Let's keep it simple. That pasta place nearby. Quick walk, good food, we're back within an hour," Luc said.
Kim looked up from his computer with obvious irritation. "We've been there five times in the past two weeks. There's a new fusion place that opened on Fifth Street that's supposed to be excellent."
"Fifth Street is a ten-minute walk each way in this weather," Luc countered. "Look outside—it's starting to drizzle again."
Amy stood at the window, watching drops streak down the glass. "Maybe we should just order in today. I really don't want to get soaked."
"We've been ordering takeout constantly," Kim replied. "I'm tired of eating soggy noodles from containers. Can't we make an effort to go somewhere decent for once?"
Jay watched the exchange with growing discomfort. The conversation held an edge of irritation that hadn't been present in their previous lunch discussions. Everyone seemed to be operating with shortened patience and elevated frustration levels.
"The pasta place is fine with me," Jay offered diplomatically.
They ended up at the nearest option, but Kim grumbled throughout the meal about the limited menu and predictable atmosphere. The pasta was well-prepared, but Kim's dissatisfaction cast a shadow over the entire lunch that left everyone feeling vaguely annoyed.
On Tuesday skies were clearer, and Kim immediately pushed for his fusion restaurant choice. Luc agreed reluctantly, muttering about the walk and the likelihood that they'd end up rushing back through puddles.
The fusion place turned out to serve inventive dishes in an atmosphere that was both trendy and comfortable, but the longer walk meant they had to eat quickly to return on time. Luc complained about the pace throughout the meal and continued his criticism during the walk back, noting every wet patch they had to cross and every gust of cold wind that cut through their jackets.
"The food was good," Amy said, clearly trying to defuse the tension. "Maybe we can come back when the weather improves."
"If the weather ever improves," Luc replied darkly.
Wednesday brought heavy rain that made outdoor dining impossible. They ordered from the Lotus Kitchen again, but the delivery arrived forty-five minutes late with lukewarm food that had clearly sat in the delivery vehicle too long. The noodles were congealed, the spring rolls soggy, and everyone ate in frustrated silence while watching the rain pound against the office windows.
Jay was caught between his colleagues' competing preferences and deteriorating moods. He tried to remain amiable, agreeing with whoever spoke first and avoiding any comments that might add to the tension. He worried about seeming difficult or high-maintenance by expressing preferences that might complicate the group's already strained decision-making process.
The atmosphere was fragile. Perhaps it was the accumulated stress of the harsh winter and heavy workload, or maybe the persistent gloominess of March's weather was affecting everyone's mood. Whatever the cause, the friendships that had sustained them through previous challenges now seemed strained by the mundane challenge of choosing where to eat lunch.
Through it all, Ian remained completely unaffected by the team's dining dilemmas. He ate his portioned meals at exactly one each day, sitting in the office kitchen with containers that were expertly prepared. The contents varied—sometimes grilled chicken with vegetables, occasionally salmon with quinoa, always balanced and deliberately planned.
Ian never participated in the lunch discussions or seemed bothered by the rain, the cold, or the team's fluctuating moods. His habits remained unchanged regardless of external circumstances, a consistency that Jay found comforting amid the general atmospheric tension.
March was shaping up to be one of the most challenging months Jay had experienced at Turner & Associates. His health was slowly improving, but the combination of persistent weather, workplace stress, and the team's unusual discord created an environment that felt more difficult.
Jay's energy levels remained inconsistent, good days alternating with afternoons when his stamina flagged without warning. The lingering effects of his illness made the gloomy weather feel more oppressive, as if the external atmosphere was amplifying his internal sense of depletion.
At least April was only a few weeks away, and with it the promise of better weather and the quarterly party that might help restore some of the team's camaraderie. For now, Jay focused on diplomatic neutrality and looked forward to the day when choosing a lunch destination would once again be a simple matter of preference.
## Scene 2
Failure
The phone call came at three-fifteen on a Thursday, interrupting Ian's review of cash flow forecasts. The lawyer's voice was measured but held urgency that immediately commanded attention.
"We needed that compliance document by noon today, Ian. The deadline was absolute."
"Which document?"
"Subscription agreement addendum for Lagerstrom Holdings. I sent the reminder last week with all the specifics."
Ian pulled up his calendar, scanning for any mention of the deadline. Nothing appeared in his scheduled tasks or flagged emails. "Let me check my communications and call you back."
After ending the call, Ian searched his email inbox systematically. The Lagerstrom Holdings reminder wasn't in his priority folder or his pending actions list. He expanded his search to include all messages from the past two weeks and found it buried in his general inbox, marked as non-urgent.
Ian stared at the email, reading the requirements. The message should have been flagged immediately as high priority, scheduled on his calendar, and followed up with reminder notifications. Instead, it had been categorized as unimportant correspondence and forgotten.
He knew he’d have to bring it to Jay’s attention. Under normal circumstances, it would be a straightforward correction—point out the mistake, explain the proper procedure, and move on. But with Jay still looking pale from his recent illness, Ian was wary of making him dwell on it. The message had to be delivered without softening the facts, yet without making it seem like a disaster.
"Jay, could I speak with you for a moment?" Ian appeared at Jay's desk later that afternoon.
"Of course." Jay looked up from the client reports he had been reviewing, immediately sensing tension in Ian's posture.
They walked to Ian's office, and Ian closed the door before sitting behind his desk. Jay sat down, trying to read Ian's expression for clues about what might have gone wrong.
"There was an issue with Lagerstrom Holdings filing," Ian began. "The deadline was yesterday, and we missed it."
Jay felt his stomach drop.
"The law firm sent notification about the requirement last Tuesday. It was flagged as non-urgent."
The memory hit Jay like cold water. The legal email with its ambiguous subject and dense content, filed away as something that could wait for attention during less hectic periods.
"I'm sorry. I misunderstood the importance."
"Legal communications can be deliberately unclear. The subject lines rarely indicate urgency, and the language is often unnecessarily complex. It's a common challenge, even for experts."
Jay appreciated Ian's attempt to soften the criticism, but the fact remained—he had made a serious error that had real consequences. "What happens now?"
"We'll file a late submission with penalty fees. The client relationship isn't damaged, but it's an unnecessary expense and administrative complication. Going forward, when you're uncertain about a message's importance, the default should always be to flag it for my review."
"I understand."
"Mistakes happen, Jay. The important thing is learning from them and implementing systems to prevent repetition."
Jay managed to nod, but inside he felt like he was crumbling. Ian's patience and constructive approach only highlighted the trust he had violated and the standards he had failed to meet.
"I know. I'll be more careful."
"I'm confident you will be. This was an oversight, not a pattern."
"Is there anything else?" Jay asked in a  strained voice. Ian's reassurance seemed to make him feel worse, as though kindness was harder to bear than criticism.
"No, that covers it."
Jay returned to his desk with rigid movements. Ian watched him sit on his chair and resume working, looking like he was fighting back tears.
By five, Jay was relieved his recent illness had set the expectation that he’d leave at a normal hour. The thought of remaining in the office while struggling to maintain composure felt unbearable. He packed his things  and headed for the metro.
He walked to the station with his head down, replaying the conversation and trying to understand how he had made such a fundamental error. The legal email had seemed unimportant when he'd scanned it, but Ian was right—he should have read it more carefully, should have erred on the side of caution.
It wasn't his first mistake since starting the job. There had been moments when his inexperience showed despite his best efforts. Ian had always been patient with his errors, offering guidance without making him feel incompetent. But this felt different, more serious.
The metro was crowded with commuters, but Jay barely noticed the press of bodies around him. He stared at his reflection in the dark window, seeing someone who looked tired and defeated.
His apartment felt like a refuge when he finally reached it, like a sanctuary where he could safely fall apart. He went straight to his bed and pulled the covers over his head, seeking darkness and isolation from the world that had once again proven too challenging for his capabilities.
The past few weeks had been testing him to a degree he wasn't sure he could handle. The workload, the endless winter, office tensions, persistent illness, and now a failure that called into question everything he thought he had achieved.
Maybe he wasn't cut out for this work after all. Maybe Max's original assessment had been correct, and Jay was nothing more than a joke hire who had temporarily fooled everyone, including himself, into believing he belonged in such a prestigious environment.
The thought of facing Ian tomorrow, of sitting at his desk and trying to act normal while knowing he had disappointed the one person whose respect mattered most, was unbearable. How could he maintain composure when everything pointed to his inadequacy?
Eventually, hunger forced him from bed. Jay reheated his dinner and ate it slouched on the couch, too disconcerted to care about table manners. The food was tasteless, just fuel to sustain him through another evening of self-doubt. He left the dishes in the sink for the night, unable to muster his sense of order. 
The shower helped slightly, the hot water washing away some of the day's tension if not its underlying problems. Jay prepared his clothes for tomorrow with extra care, checking every detail to ensure nothing could go wrong with his appearance. He couldn't give Ian any reason to question his commitment.
## Scene 3
Hot chocolate with rum
Jay arrived at the office fifteen minutes early, hoping the extra time would help him compose himself before facing his colleagues. He wore a smile that felt like a mask stretched too tight across his face. Every greeting required conscious effort, every interaction a performance designed to convince people he wasn't falling apart internally.
The effort was unsuccessful.
"Good morning, Jay," Amy said brightly as she passed his desk.
"Good morning!" Jay replied with forced enthusiasm. The smile he had rehearsed felt like a grimace, and Amy's brief look of confusion confirmed his failure to appear normal. Each forced moment of cheerfulness only highlighted his underlying distress.
Ian called him into his office at nine-thirty for their daily briefing, his manner unchanged from any other morning. He reviewed the day's schedule and asked Jay to prepare materials for an afternoon meeting.
Jay found Ian's consistency both comforting and unsettling. Part of him had expected different treatment—perhaps coolness or increased oversight—but Ian behaved exactly as he had the day before the mistake. The normalcy felt like a gift, proof that Ian still trusted him despite yesterday's failure.
But it also left Jay uncertain about where he stood. He wanted reassurance, wanted someone to tell him that mistakes were survivable and that his position was secure. Did Ian's unchanged behavior mean the mistake was truly forgiven, or was he simply maintaining decorum while privately reassessing Jay's capabilities?
Ian, meanwhile, struggled with his own internal conflict. From his office, he could see Jay's rigid posture and forced interactions, could practically feel the anxiety radiating from his desk. Every instinct told Ian to offer comfort, to find ways to demonstrate that the incident was insignificant.
His management training argued for different approach. Drawing more attention to the error might make Jay feel worse, might signal that the mistake was more serious than Ian had indicated. Better to demonstrate through behavior that their relationship remained stable.
Ian knew his concern went beyond appropriate managerial interest in team morale. He was worried about Jay specifically, personally, and it had nothing to do with work and everything to do with the young man's obvious distress.
Lunch provided no relief for Jay. The weather had finally begun to soften, with temperatures climbing and rain subsiding. The team was less grumpy about venturing outside, and they chose a restaurant that actually served appealing food.
But Jay could barely taste his meal. The conversation around him felt distant and unimportant, and his contributions were stilted. He questioned every comment, second-guessing responses that would have been natural weeks ago.
"Everything alright?" Ela asked during a lull in conversation.
"Fine," Jay said quickly. "I slept poorly. Must be the change of weather."
The lie was obvious to everyone at the table, but no one pressed for details.
Back at the office, Jay tried to lose himself in administrative tasks, but concentration remained elusive. Every email required multiple readings, every decision felt fraught with potential for additional mistakes.
"Jay?" Luc appeared at his desk around three o'clock, clearly concerned. "Can I talk to you for a minute?"
They walked to a quiet corner of the break room, away from the afternoon bustle.
"Is everything okay? You look like your pet just died."
Despite himself, Jay smiled at the dark humor. "I'm fine."
"No, you're really not. What's going on?"
Jay's composure finally cracked. "I made a serious mistake yesterday. Missed an important deadline because I misclassified an email. Ian was very patient about it, but..."
"But you're beating yourself up. Jay, these things happen. Trust me, whatever you did wasn't that serious in the grand scheme of things."
"It cost the company money. It was a compliance issue."
"So? Missed deadlines are part of business. We pay fees and move on. It's not career-ending."
Jay wanted to believe him, but the mistake felt too major to dismiss. 
"I let Ian down. He's been so patient with my learning curve, and I repaid that trust by screwing up something important." 
"Jay, if Ian fired everyone who made filing mistakes, this office would be empty. Trust me, you're not the first person to misread a legal notice."
At five, Luc appeared at Jay's desk again. "Come on. Let me buy you a drink. You need to get out of your head."
"I should probably just go home."
"Absolutely not. You're going to sit in your apartment and spiral into a depression about one mistake. That's not happening on my watch."
They walked together through the gradually warming streets, and Jay discovered that Luc lived remarkably close to the office.
"Fifteen-minute walk," Luc explained. "One metro stop if the weather's really terrible. I love this neighborhood, even though the rent is insane. The convenience is worth it."
He led Jay down a narrow side street to a small cafe tucked between a bookstore and a vintage clothing shop. The interior was warm and dimly lit, with atmosphere that invited long conversations.
"Two hot chocolates," Luc told the server. "With rum. And extra whipped cream."
"I don't drink during the week," Jay protested.
"Trust me. Nothing lifts the mood like chocolate, alcohol, and dairy products combined. This place makes the best hot chocolate in the city. Thick enough to stand a spoon in."
The hot chocolate arrived in enormous mugs, topped with clouds of whipped cream and dusted with cinnamon. It was absurdly rich and warming, the rum adding just enough heat to chase away the lingering chill of winter and worry.
"When I first started at Turner & Associates, I sent a confidential client report to the wrong email address. Complete security breach. The client was furious, compliance had to get involved, and I thought I was going to be fired on the spot."
"What happened?"
"Ian handled it masterfully. Took full responsibility, smoothed things over with the client, and then sat me down to review email protocols. My hands were shaking for a week afterward, but he never made me feel like an idiot. A missed deadline is nothing compared to that."
The warmth from the drink was spreading through Jay's chest, and he felt his shoulders relax slightly.
"I just don't want to disappoint him," Jay admitted.
"You won't. Ian values competence and dedication, both of which you have in abundance. One mistake doesn't erase months of great work."
The cafe's gentle atmosphere worked its magic on Jay's frayed nerves. The hot chocolate was exactly what he hadn't known he needed, comforting and shared with someone who understood the pressures of their work environment.
"Thank you," Jay said as they prepared to leave. "This really helped."
"Anytime. We all need someone to remind us that mistakes aren't the end of the world."
The walk back to the metro felt better than yesterday. Jay's mood remained dampened, but the tight knot of anxiety in his chest had loosened. Luc's perspective had provided exactly the reassurance that Jay had been unable to manufacture.
By the time Jay reached his apartment, he felt better. The mistake still troubled him, and tomorrow would still require more vigilance, but perhaps he could face it without the crushing weight of shame that had dominated his thoughts since yesterday afternoon.
## Scene 4
Justice
By the end of the week, Jay stopped being so tense and his smile no longer required conscious effort to maintain. The immediate crisis of the missed deadline had passed, leaving behind a manageable residue of embarrassment and heightened caution. The crushing despair that had threatened to consume him seemed overdramatic in retrospect.
He had implemented a new system for email management—a final review of the non-urgent folder at the end of the day to catch any misfiled communications before they could cause problems. The additional step felt like insurance against future mistakes, a small price to pay for peace of mind.
"Looking better," Amy observed during their Friday afternoon coffee break. "Whatever was bothering you earlier seems to be resolving."
"Just had a rough patch. These things pass," Jay replied, and he meant it. Mistakes happened because he was human, not because he was inept. The important thing was learning from errors and implementing systems to prevent repetition. Luc's perspective had helped him understand that career included setbacks as well as successes.
Ian watched this progression with relief. Jay's recovery was proceeding exactly as it should—initial distress followed by practical adjustment and renewed determination. Ian’s choice to continue normal treatment instead of hovering with reassurance turned out to be right.
Luc's intervention had been supportive and perfectly timed. Ian wondered that perhaps Luc deserved recognition for his handling of a sensitive situation. A raise, maybe. 
He caught himself mid-thought and frowned. That was excessive. Luc had simply shown basic collegiality toward a distressed teammate. The situation had resolved naturally through peer-level intervention, nothing more.
He was giving the matter too much attention, creating significance where none existed. Jay was a valued employee who had made a mistake, received guidance, and moved forward. The end. But even as Ian told himself these things, he knew they were excuses. 
Thankfully, he didn't have much time to examine his feelings too deeply. His thoughts had been occupied lately by an entirely different matter, one that had nothing to do with filing systems and everything to do with a man named Ric Cruver, who had cornered Jay at the company gala three months ago.
Orrey Capital Partners maintained accounts worth tens of millions annually to Turner & Associates. They weren't handled by Ian's team directly, but fell under the firm's broader portfolio of institutional clients. Terminating such relationships required justification and senior management approval.
Ian had spent the past three months building that justification.
It had started with research—reviewing Orrey's public filings, examining their transaction patterns. Most companies had irregularities if you knew where to look, and Ian possessed both the expertise and motivation to look very thoroughly indeed.
The first discovery had been relatively minor—dubious accounting practices that didn't quite cross legal lines. Interesting but insufficient grounds for termination. Ian had continued digging. 
The months of investigation had yielded exactly what Ian had expected to find. The company presented a respectable facade that concealed ethical compromises typical of firms that employed predatory individuals in client-facing roles.
Offshore transfers through shell companies. Regulatory filings submitted with suspicious timing. Board members with connections to recently sanctioned entities. Individually, these elements might be explained as aggressive but legal business practices. Together, they created a pattern pointing to deeper issues.
The corruption Ian had uncovered was the final nail in the coffin. Orrey had apparently facilitated payments to overseas officials through a complex series of investment vehicles that provided plausible cover for what were essentially bribes. The transactions were sophisticated enough to avoid obvious detection, but transparent enough that any serious investigation would expose their true nature.
Ian had been careful to build his case through legitimate channels. Anonymous tips to regulatory agencies. Conversations with former Orrey employees who were willing to discuss their experiences. Public records requests that revealed inconsistencies in official statements.
Three weeks ago, a preliminary investigation had been opened. The inquiry was still confidential, but Ian had sources who kept him informed about such developments.
Yesterday, a former Orrey accountant had agreed to cooperate with investigators, providing documentation of internal practices that violated several regulations. The investigation was about to become very public and very serious.
Ian reviewed the memo he had prepared for Turner Senior one final time. The language was dry, focusing on valid business risks.
"Recent regulatory developments concerning Orrey Capital Partners require immediate attention. A formal investigation into the company's practices has been initiated, with particular focus on offshore transaction structures and reporting irregularities. Given the scope of the investigation and potential reputational risks to Turner & Associates, I recommend reviewing our client relationship."
The memo made no mention of Ric Cruver specifically, though Ian had no doubt that a man who would harass people at a corporate event was exactly the type to work for a company with ethical problems. Birds of a feather, as the saying went.
Ian had uncovered corruption through entirely legitimate means. The fact that his investigation had been motivated by personal reasons didn't invalidate the evidence or make his recommendations inappropriate. Orrey Capital Partners deserved whatever consequences their business practices brought them.
And if Cruver ended up unemployed when Orrey inevitably collapsed under regulatory scrutiny, well, that was simply karma operating as it should.
Ian signed the memo and placed it in his outgoing correspondence. Turner Senior would receive it Monday morning, along with supporting documentation that painted a clear picture of a client relationship that had become a liability.
Once submitted, the process would move quickly. Turner Senior trusted Ian's judgment on risk assessment, and the documented evidence was compelling enough to support immediate action. Within a week, Orrey would receive formal notification that Turner & Associates was terminating their business relationship. Cruver would lose his primary justification for attending Turner & Associates events, eliminating any future opportunity for him to come in contact with Jay. 
Jay continued reviewing emails at his desk, completely unaware that Ian had spent three months systematically destroying the life of the man who had made him uncomfortable at a corporate party. Ian intended to keep it that way. Jay didn't need to know about Cruver's impending downfall, just as he didn't need to know that Ian had been unable to forget the sight of Jay's terrified eyes that January evening. Ian returned to his work, confident that one problem was soon to be permanently resolved.
## Scene 5
Orrey Fallout
Weather turned mild on the last Monday of March, and Jay's spirits had lifted as he walked to work without needing to brace against bitter wind. His new coat, which had been essential for survival during February's brutal cold, now felt almost too warm in the spring air. The lingering traces of his winter illness had finally disappeared. The sting of his mistake had faded.
The office atmosphere mirrored the seasonal change. Lunch plans were made with enthusiasm, and even Luc cracked jokes that didn't have undertones of weather-related misery.
Around ten-thirty, whispers began circulating through the entire floor. Jay caught fragments of conversations—mentions of investigations, regulatory problems, client relationships under review. The gossip network that connected Turner & Associates was subtle, and news was spreading quickly about something big.
"Jay," Luc appeared at his desk with a coffee cup. "Coffee break. I need to ask you about something."
They went to the kitchen and sat on chairs near the windows, while the coffee machine worked in the background as they talked.
"So," Luc began, "what do you know about Orrey Capital Partners?"
"Should I know something about them?"
"Come on, you manage Ian's email. There's no way you haven't seen communications about what's happening with them."
Even if Jay had seen such emails—which he hadn't, beyond the standard correspondence—he wouldn't have shared details with anyone. Ian's communications were confidential, and Jay treated them with the same discretion he would expect from a doctor or lawyer.
"I haven't seen anything unusual," Jay said honestly. "Why?"
"Word is spreading that Turner & Associates just terminated their relationship. Apparently there's some kind of investigation. Major scandal brewing."
Client terminations were rare events, and clearly serious enough to generate office-wide discussion when they occurred.
"That's only the third time in company history," Luc continued. "Last time was before either of us worked here. It's a big deal."
Amy conspicuously entered the kitchen and joined the conversation. "Official investigation. Major compliance violations, possible criminal charges. Turner Senior decided to cut ties immediately so we don't risk association."
"That's... a lot," Jay muttered.
As the day progressed, the Orrey situation dominated conversation. By lunch, everyone knew that a formal investigation has been opened. The team even changed their choice of restaurant for the day, opting for a small place with dim lighting and music just loud enough to cover hushed voices. Plates of butter chicken sat cooling as conversation circled endlessly around the same points: who had known what, who was likely to be implicated, who might already be cooperating with investigators.
Max claimed to know some of the Orrey partners by name. Luc kept prompting him for more gossip. Every revelation earned a chorus of murmured disbelief or dark amusement, as though the group couldn’t decide whether to be appalled or impressed.
Jay mostly listened. By the time they returned to the office, the Orrey scandal had grown in scope and consequence, reshaped by every retelling. Later that afternoon, details were emerging about offshore transactions and regulatory violations that painted a picture of systematic corruption.
Jay recalled Ric Cruver and felt a surge of vindictive pleasure. The man who had cornered him at the gala worked for a company now facing federal investigation. There was poetic justice in that development.
On Tuesday Ian called for an official team meeting where he formally announced Turner & Associates' decision to terminate the Orrey relationship.
"Effective immediately, we will no longer provide services to Orrey Capital Partners," Ian explained to the assembled staff. "The ongoing investigation presents reputational risks that outweigh any financial benefits of maintaining the relationship."
"What kind of investigation?" Max asked.
"Securities fraud, money laundering, violations of offshore reporting requirements. The scope is impressive."
Jay felt visible relief wash over him. Never having to see Cruver again, never having to worry about encountering him at corporate events, felt like an unexpected gift from the universe. His removal eliminated a source of background anxiety he was only now recognizing. Spring really was bringing good news.
Since Ian's team hadn't directly handled the Orrey account, the termination wouldn't create additional workload for them. But Ian, as CFO, was deeply involved in the transition process, and Jay noticed an immediate increase in legal emails and regulatory correspondence crossing his desk.
Jay flagged every Orrey-related message as urgent. Whatever bureaucratic complications arose from severing ties with corrupt clients, he was determined to ensure Ian had immediate access to all relevant information.
By Friday, major newspapers were reporting on the investigation. They ran a detailed analysis of Orrey's business practices and explored the broader implications for investment management oversight. Turner & Associates was mentioned favourably for their prompt action in distancing themselves from the scandal.
"We dodged a bullet," Ela observed during the afternoon break. "Being associated with this kind of mess would have been a nightmare."
Jay saw Ian read the newspaper coverage. Turner & Associates' reputation remained intact, their decisive action viewed as prudent risk management. But Ian still followed the news with concern.
Ian remembered his own scandal years earlier—the tabloid headlines, the invasive coverage, the way reporters had dissected every detail of his personal life when his relationship with Sam Connelly had exploded into public view. The ruthlessness with which his private affairs had been turned into entertainment for people who didn't know him.
Ian thought he had deserved the consequences. His poor judgement had created the mess entirely. The media attention had been brutal but expected—a natural result of his own foolishness.
Orrey's senior staff would face similar scrutiny, but Ian felt no sympathy for their situation. Unlike his own case, caused by naivety and lack of experience, Orrey's problems stemmed from deliberate corruption and ethical violations. They deserved whatever consequences their actions brought.
But the memory served as a sharp reminder of why personal feelings had no place in the workplace. Ian watched Jay organizing the latest batch of Orrey correspondence, clearly pleased that Cruver's employer was facing investigation and disgrace.
Jay looked better. The combination of improving weather, recovered health, and seeing his harasser's company destroyed had lifted his spirits. Ian was glad to see Jay's confidence returning, but the sight also reinforced his determination to maintain distance.
He could not afford to develop feelings for Jay, no matter how much he enjoyed the young man's company or how protective he felt about his well-being. The Orrey situation had worked out well, but it also demonstrated how quickly personal feelings could drive his decisions. Strictly business, he reminded himself. That was the only safe path forward.
