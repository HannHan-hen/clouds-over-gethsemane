# Chapter 12: Stormy weather
## Scene 1
Stormy morning
The storm hit the city with fury that made it feel personal. Freezing rain pelted the windows of Jay's apartment at five-thirty in the morning, and by six, the power had went out completely. He dressed by the light of his phone, checking transit updates that grew increasingly dire with each refresh.
"Metro suspended on all lines due to power outages. Estimated restoration time unknown."
Jay had left his apartment twenty minutes earlier than usual, anticipating delays, but he hadn't counted on the sheer violence of the weather. The streets were rivers of slush and ice, and the few buses running were packed beyond capacity. By the time he reached the financial district, the expensive wool coat was already damp and heavy, the supposed waterproofing no match for the winter storm. His shoes squelched with every step, and he was forty-five minutes late.
He'd sent Ian a text: "Power outage in my area. Metro suspended. Will be late but coming in as soon as possible."
The response had been immediate: "Don't worry about it. Be safe."
But Jay did worry about it. In almost seven months at Turner & Associates, he'd never been late. Not once. The sick feeling in his stomach had nothing to do with the cold.
Standing outside the Northlight Financial Center, drenched and shivering, Jay spotted a boutique across the street with its lights already on. The elegant script on the window read "Hathaway's Menswear" and under normal circumstances, he would have walked past without a second glance. The place sold sweaters for thousands to men who thought nothing of such expenses.
But these weren't normal circumstances.
The bell chimed softly as he entered, water dripping from his coat onto the pristine floor. A well-dressed clerk appeared immediately, taking in Jay's bedraggled state with composure.
"I need a complete change of clothes. Everything. I’m a size 46 jacket, medium shirt, 80 waist, and size 42 shoes.”
The clerk's expression didn't change. "Certainly, sir. Business attire?"
"Yes. And I'm in a hurry."
Within minutes, the man had assembled a selection: cream trousers that looked like they'd been cut from silk, a white shirt with subtle texture, a charcoal blazer that felt impossibly soft, leather shoes that gleamed despite the store's dim lighting, and undergarments still in their packaging.
"Will you be trying these on?"
Jay glanced at his phone. Nearly nine o'clock. "No time. I'll take them."
The total made his chest tighten. More than he'd spent on clothing in the past year combined. But he handed over his card anyway, too rushed and miserable to properly process the financial damage.
The Turner & Associates lobby felt like a sanctuary after the chaos outside. Jay's shoes squelched against the marble as he approached the elevators, acutely aware of the water trail he was leaving behind. The elevator ride to the thirty-fourth floor felt endless.
The office was half-full, with various team members shaking off coats and complaining about the commute. Ela looked up from her desk, her perfect hair slightly mussed.
"This weather is insane," she said. "I saw three accidents between my house and here."
Jay managed a weak smile and headed straight for Ian's office. The door was open, and Ian sat at his desk looking as immaculate as ever, not a hair out of place. Of course. He probably had a driver who delivered him directly to the underground garage.
"I'm sorry I'm late," Jay said from the doorway.
Ian looked up with barely disguised concern. "You look like you swam here."
"I might have. I need to go change my clothes."
"Go. There are towels in the executive bathroom." Jay caught the underlying worry in his voice. "Take your time."
The executive bathroom was a revelation Jay had never fully appreciated. Thick, hotel-quality towels hung from heated racks, and the space felt more like a spa than an office facility. Jay stripped out of his soaked clothing, toweling off his hair and trying to warm his chilled skin.
The new clothes fit perfectly, which was either remarkable luck or a testament to the clerk's expertise. The trousers moved with him like they'd been tailored, and the shirt felt like wearing a cloud. The shoes were comfortable despite being unworn, and everything coordinated with elegance that Jay had never achieved in his life.
He caught his reflection in the mirror and barely recognized himself. The clothes flattered him, highlighting his frame. The cut of the trousers made his legs look longer. He looked expensive. Polished.
It was too much. Too obvious. But his regular clothes hung dripping from the towel rack, and he had no other options.
When he returned to his desk, a steaming mug waited for him. Ian emerged from his office, holding his own cup.
"Ginger tea," Ian said. "From my personal supply. It's good for warming up."
"Thank you."
Ian's voice sounded slightly strained. "The storm is supposed to continue through the afternoon. If you need to leave early—"
"I'll be fine." Jay sipped the tea, surprised by its complexity. Not the simple ginger tea he'd expected, but something layered with honey and spices that warmed him from the inside out. "This is excellent."
"My housekeeper makes it." Ian seemed to be looking everywhere except directly at Jay. "She insists it prevents illness."
Jay sat at his desk, opening his laptop. Checking emails and reviewing Ian's schedule felt grounding after the morning's chaos. He was aware of how the new clothes moved with him, how the fabric felt against his skin, but he pushed the awareness aside. Work was work, regardless of what he wore.
From his office, Ian stole glances at his assistant, then forced himself to look away. Jay had always been attractive, but these clothes revealed what had been hidden beneath his wardrobe, and his still-damp hair gave him a tousled look that was unexpectedly appealing.
Ian gripped his coffee cup tighter and focused on his computer screen. This was exactly the reaction he'd trained himself to avoid. But Jay looked... God, he looked incredible. And completely unaware of it, which somehow made it worse.
Ian closed his eyes briefly, then opened them and forced himself to concentrate on work. The storm outside continued to rage, but the real tempest was happening inside his chest, where feelings he'd been suppressing threatened to overwhelm his defenses.
At his desk, Jay worked, occasionally glancing toward Ian's office when he thought no one was looking. The ginger tea warmed him and gradually, the morning's disasters faded into memory.
He had no idea that Ian was fighting the strongest urge he'd felt in years—the desire to cross the space between them, to touch Jay's hair, to discover if those new clothes felt as good as they looked.
## Scene 2
Discomfort
Jay was three hours into his regular workday when Luc appeared at his desk with a peculiar expression on his face.
"Okay, I have to ask. When did you decide to switch careers to menswear modeling?"
Jay's fingers paused over his keyboard. "What?"
"This whole look." Luc gestured at Jay's outfit. "Very successful young executive with mysterious past."
"It's just clothes. Emergency replacements after this morning's disaster."
"Emergency replacements that probably cost more than my car."
"Close. About two paychecks worth. If it wasn't so embarrassing, I'd return them."
"Return them? Are you insane? You absolutely cannot return them. They're worth every penny. You look... You look so good I'm suddenly questioning my sexuality."
Jay managed a weak smile, but his chest tightened with discomfort. "That's a disturbing thought for both of us."
"I'm serious though. You should keep these for special occasions. Dates. You'd sweep anyone off their feet."
Jay's smile felt brittle. "Right. Special occasions."
He thought about his empty social calendar, his studio apartment where he spent most evenings alone. The clothes were beautiful, expensive, and completely wasted on someone who had no intention of impressing anyone. His love life was a deliberately barren landscape, and he intended to keep it that way.
Loneliness could be sharp sometimes, cutting through the quiet of his apartment. But it was still infinitely preferable to the discomfort of relationships, the vulnerability they demanded, the ways they could go wrong.
"Anyway," Luc continued, oblivious to Jay's internal spiral, "emergency or not, you look fantastic. Don't let it go to waste."
After Luc left, Jay was hyper-aware of every movement, every glance from colleagues, every reflection in the elevator doors. The clothes felt like a costume now, drawing attention he didn't want and couldn't handle. He pulled at the sleeves, trying to make it feel less fitted, less obvious. 
Amy walked past his desk and did a double-take. "New wardrobe?"
"Emergency purchase," Jay said quickly.
"Well, it looks great."
Each compliment felt like a weight added to his shoulders. He wasn't used to being noticed, didn't want to be noticed. The expensive fabric felt like a spotlight, highlighting everything he'd rather keep hidden. He knew his coworkers meant well, but being on display made his skin crawl.
The self-consciousness continued for the rest of the day. Jay threw himself into work with extra concentration, hoping to distract himself from the way people looked at him differently.
Ian, meanwhile, found concentration impossible. Every time Jay moved past his office, every glimpse of those perfectly fitted trousers sent his mind spiraling into territories he'd sworn off. He stared at the curve of Jay's neck when he leaned over files, the way the fabric moved across his shoulders when he reached for something.
By four o'clock, Ian had reread the same report three times without absorbing a single word. He closed his laptop with more force than necessary and rubbed his temples, trying to banish the increasingly vivid images that kept surfacing despite his best efforts.
This was exactly what he'd feared the most when Leo first suggested hiring Jay. Not the corporate espionage—that had been a convenient excuse. This. The way attraction could undermine years of self-control, how it could make even the most disciplined person lose perspective.
Jay wasn't Sam. Jay was earnest, hardworking, and completely uninterested in him. And that made it worse, because it meant Ian's feelings weren't just inappropriate—they were unwanted.
Jay was relieved when five arrived. He gathered his things quickly, eager to escape the day's accumulated discomfort. The storm had passed, leaving the city washed clean but still bitter cold.
Outside, he flagged a taxi without hesitation. If he'd taken a taxi this morning instead of relying on the public transport, none of this would have happened. The ride would have been inconvenient but manageable. Instead, his penny-pinching had cost him thousands in emergency clothing.
The taxi pulled up to his building, and Jay paid the fare without mentally calculating the metro alternative. Some lessons were expensive.
In his apartment, he hung the designer clothes with excessive care, spacing them properly in his closet. They looked absurd next to his regular wardrobe—like artefacts from someone else's life. He found a large zip-lock bag and sealed them inside, double-checking the closure. If these were going to represent two months of his salary, he'd make damn sure nothing happened to them.
He made a mental list: keep a spare suit at the office, always take taxis in bad weather, never again underestimate the city's capacity for chaos. The emergency fund he'd been building could absorb this hit, but it still stung.
As he heated leftover soup for dinner, Jay turned over the day's strange dichotomy in his mind. He'd looked better than he ever had in his life, and it had made him miserable. The compliments felt like spotlights, the attention like judgement. He preferred the invisibility, the safety of blending in.
At the other end of the city, Ian stood in his pristine kitchen, staring at a glass of wine he'd poured but hadn't touched. The image of Jay in kept surfacing, no matter how many times he pushed it down. The way the trousers had followed the line of his body, the flush in his cheeks from the cold and tea.
Ian had spent years building walls that had kept him safe and successful. But watching Jay work today had shaken something loose. The fantasies that followed were persistent, scenarios of slowly removing those beautiful clothes, discovering the body beneath, learning how his skin might feel and how he might respond to being touched.
He drained the wine in one swallow and headed for his home gym. Perhaps exhaustion could accomplish what discipline hadn't.
In his small apartment, Jay changed into something comfortable and tried to forget about designer fabrics and unwanted attention. Tomorrow he'd return to anonymity, and the expensive clothes would remain safely sealed in their plastic bag, waiting for a special occasion that would never come.
Neither man slept well that night, though for very different reasons.
## Scene 3
Fever
Jay woke the next morning with a scratchy throat and a headache that felt like someone had wrapped his skull in cotton. He dismissed it as lingering stress from the previous day's financial disaster, downing extra coffee and forcing himself through his morning tasks.
By afternoon, the headache had evolved into something more sinister. His body ached, and he shivered despite the office's consistent temperature. When he stood to deliver files to Ian's office, the world tilted slightly.
"Are you feeling alright?" Ian asked, looking up from his desk. "You look pale."
"I'm fine," Jay said automatically, though his voice sounded rough. "Just tired."
Ian's expression remained sceptical, but he didn't press. Jay returned to his desk and pushed through the remaining hours with sheer determination, ignoring the way his vision seemed to blur around the edges. He didn’t stay late that day. As soon as the workday ended, he returned home, ate his reheated dinner with a dose of paracetamol, and went to bed early, hoping whatever he was coming down with wasn’t anything serious.
The next morning brought no ambiguity. Jay woke with a fever that made his apartment feel like an arctic wasteland, his throat feeling like sandpaper, and every muscle in his body screaming protest when he tried to sit up. The sound of his alarm felt distant, as if it were coming from underwater. He reached for his phone with trembling fingers, squinting at the bright screen that made his head pound worse. 
He should be getting ready for work, should be preparing for another day of managing Ian's schedule and sorting through the endless stream of reports. Instead, he could barely lift his head from the pillow without the room spinning.
The simple act of getting to his work phone required tremendous effort. He waited until seven-thirty and dialed Ian's number with shaking fingers, dreading the conversation.
"Jay? What's wrong?"
"I'm not feeling well. I won't be in today. I'm sorry for the short notice." The admission felt like failure.
"You sound terrible. Have you seen a doctor?"
"Not yet. It's probably just flu."
"Call your doctor immediately. Don't try to push through this. Take whatever time you need to recover properly."
"I can work from home if you need anything urgent."
"Absolutely not." Ian's tone brooked no argument. "Rest. The work will wait."
Jay wanted to protest, to insist he could handle whatever needed handling, but fever made coherent thought impossible. "I'll check my email—"
"No, you won't. That's an order."
After hanging up, Jay collapsed back onto his pillow, frustrated by his own weakness. The timing couldn't have been worse—the crushing workload demanded all hands on deck, and here he was, laid low by his own carelessness. Getting drenched in the storm had been stupid enough, but he'd been pushing himself too hard for weeks, while his immune system surrendered.
Finding medical care was overwhelming. He had a general practitioner, but getting an appointment required leaving home. The thought of sitting in a waiting room filled with other sick people made him feel worse.
After twenty minutes of dealing with automated phone systems while his fever spiked higher, he managed to secure a telehealth appointment for that afternoon. The doctor would call him at two o'clock, which meant he had hours to endure the mounting symptoms alone.
The doctor called precisely on time. "Describe your symptoms, please."
"Fever, chills, sore throat, body aches. Everything hurts."
"How long have you been experiencing these symptoms?"
"I woke up with them this morning, but I felt tired yesterday. Thought it was just the workload."
"Any nausea or difficulty breathing?"
"Some nausea. Breathing is okay, just tired."
The doctor asked several more questions about his symptoms and medical history before delivering the diagnosis. "This sounds like influenza. I'm prescribing antiviral medication and something for the fever. You'll need to stay home until you're fever-free. Given the severity of your symptoms, expect to be out of work for at least a week, possibly longer."
A week. Jay tried to process the information through his fever-fogged brain. Ian would have to manage without him during one of their busiest periods.
"I'm sending the prescriptions to your preferred pharmacy. The antiviral will help reduce the duration if you start it within the first forty-eight hours."
Jay gave her the information for the pharmacy near his apartment, then realized with growing panic that he had no way to get there. The thought of getting dressed and standing in line at the pharmacy felt impossible in his current state.
After the call ended, he spent thirty minutes researching delivery options. Most pharmacies offered same-day delivery for an additional fee, but the earliest available slot was six o'clock that evening.
He ordered the delivery service with shaking hands, entering his card information twice because the numbers kept blurring together. The extra charges for express delivery felt steep, but he had no alternative.
The wait until evening stretched endlessly. Jay alternated between burning fever and violent chills, wrapping himself in every blanket he owned only to throw them off minutes later when the heat became unbearable. He managed to drink water and nibble crackers, but solid food felt impossible with his inflamed throat.
The delivery arrived at six-thirty, and Jay answered the door in his bathrobe, accepting the pharmacy bag with hands that trembled so badly the delivery person looked concerned.
"You okay, man? You look really rough."
"Just the flu," Jay managed, closing the door and leaning against it for support.
The medications provided some relief, but recovery was slow and miserable. Jay lost track of days, existing in a haze of fever dreams interrupted by coughing fits. He drifted in and out of sleep, sometimes forgetting where he was, once waking convinced he was late for an important meeting that existed only in his delirious imagination. 
The weather outside matched his internal state. February was ending with a wet, gray dissolution as the accumulated snow melted into dirty slush that clogged the gutters and made the streets treacherous. From his window, Jay watched pedestrians cross the mess with careful steps, their faces hidden behind scarves and hoods.
He felt similarly liquefied, as if the fever had melted his composure and left him as shapeless and gray as the slush outside. Tasks like taking medication or ordering food required enormous effort. Showering was impossible, he could barely stand long enough to brush his teeth.
The apartment grew stuffy and cluttered as takeout containers accumulated on every surface—soup from the place nearby, bland rice dishes he could barely swallow, tea that went cold before he remembered to drink it.
By Sunday, the fever had broken, but the exhaustion remained crushing. Jay could think more clearly, which only made him more aware of the disaster his apartment had become. Empty containers covered the coffee table and kitchen counter, used tissues overflowed from the wastebasket, and dirty clothes lay where he had dropped them during fevered attempts to regulate his body temperature. The mess felt overwhelming, another symptom of his solitary existence. No one had checked on him, no one had brought soup or offered to run errands.
Ian had sent one text on Friday asking about his condition, and Jay had responded that he was following doctor's orders to rest and will take the next week off. No further communication had followed, which was appropriate given their relationship, but it contributed to the isolation that seemed to permeate everything. His work phone sat on the table, and he'd meant to keep it charged, but in his fevered state, he'd failed to plug it in properly. By Monday, it was dead.
## Scene 4
Worry
Meanwhile, Ian discovered the true extent of his dependence on Jay. Tasks that Jay handled seamlessly now required Ian's direct attention, pulling him away from higher-level responsibilities.
But it was more than just inconvenience. The office felt empty without Jay at the desk outside his door. Ian kept glancing up from his work, expecting to see Jay's head bent over his computer.
"You're brooding," Leo observed, appearing in Ian's doorway Monday afternoon.
"I'm working."
"You're staring at your computer like it personally offended you. Missing your assistant?"
Ian's jaw tightened. "He's been out sick since Thursday."
"Have you called to check on him?"
"It's not appropriate."
"Since when do you care about appropriate?"
Ian turned back to his screen, but he couldn't focus. Leo was right, though Ian would never admit it. He'd been fighting the urge to call Jay every few hours, to drive to his apartment and check on him personally. The knowledge that Jay was alone in the city, with no family nearby, only made it worse.
By Wednesday, Ian's restraint was wearing thin. He'd called Jay's number twice, getting voicemail both times. The rational part of his mind knew that people got sick, that Jay was probably fine and just needed rest. But the irrational part imagined worst-case scenarios.
What if Jay's fever had spiked dangerously? What if he'd collapsed in his apartment with no one to help? What if—
Ian forced himself to stop. They weren't that close. Jay was his assistant, nothing more. Showing up at his apartment would be an overreach that would make them both uncomfortable. But knowing that didn't make the worry go away.
Thursday brought no word from Jay. Ian checked his phone constantly, jumping every time it buzzed. He'd composed and deleted a dozen text messages, each one crossing lines he wasn't sure he had the right to cross.
By Friday, Ian was barely functional. He'd called Jay's number twice more, each time going straight to voicemail.
He tried to focus on reports, on client calls, on the mundane tasks that Jay filtered and organized. But his attention kept drifting to the empty desk outside his office, to the unanswered phone calls, to the uncomfortable realization that somewhere along the way, Jay had become more than just competent support. Jay had become necessary. The office without him felt wrong.
The waiting felt like torture, and the concern that gnawed at him had very little to do with missed deadlines or disrupted schedules. It had everything to do with the way Jay's absence had revealed how much space he'd carved out in Ian's carefully ordered world.
Ian's phone buzzed against his desk. Jay's name appeared on the screen, and Ian's heart rate spiked embarrassingly.
"I'm feeling better and should be back Monday. Sorry for the extended absence."
Ian stared at the message, relief flooding through him. He wanted to type a dozen questions. Are you sure you're better? Do you need anything? Have you been eating?
Instead, he typed: "Take the weekend to recover fully. See you Monday."
It was appropriate and completely inadequate for what he wanted to say. Ian set his phone down and closed his eyes, finally allowing himself to breathe properly.
Jay set his phone aside and returned to the soup he'd been forcing himself to eat. Monday would come whether he was ready or not, and he needed to be strong enough to face the accumulated work waiting for him.
The past week felt like a dream now that his temperature had finally normalized. Days were filled with aching muscles and throat pain, broken only by the arrival of soup deliveries and the struggle to swallow medication. He started to feel better around Wednesday, but he'd still spent most of the time in bed, too weak to do anything productive.
Friday was the first day he'd felt fully human again, which meant confronting the disaster his apartment had become. Empty takeout containers covered every flat surface, laundry was scattered across the bedroom floor, and the sink was full of dishes he'd been too exhausted to wash. The air felt stale and sickly, and Jay realized he haven't opened the windows in over a week.
He tackled the cleanup, working in short bursts with rest breaks between tasks. Throwing away the accumulated trash took two trips to the building's dumpster. Doing the dishes required sitting on a kitchen stool to manage the dizziness. 
He found his company phone buried under a pile of used tissues on the nightstand, completely dead. The sight of the black screen triggered a flutter of anxiety. What if Ian had needed something urgent? What if there had been crisis situations requiring his attention? He plugged the phone into its charger and waited for it to power on, mentally preparing for a flood of missed calls and urgent messages. When the screen finally illuminated, he found four missed calls from Ian and texts from Luc and Amy wishing him fast recovery. He immediately sent a message to Ian and was relieved to get a quick reply—clearly, nothing too urgent had happened. He also let his colleagues know he would be back on Monday.
The much needed shower refreshed him both physically and mentally. Hot water washed away the staleness of sick days, and clean clothes felt like putting on a new identity. Jay looked at himself in the bathroom mirror and was startled by how pale and thin he looked. A week of barely eating had carved hollows under his eyes.
By evening, the apartment was habitable again, though far from pristine. Jay had managed to change his sheets, and the fresh air from the open windows had cleared out the worst of the stagnant atmosphere. Sleeping in clean bedding after days of fevered restlessness was soothing.
On Saturday he had enough energy for a shopping expedition. Jay wrapped himself in his winter coat and ventured to the grocery store, moving slowly through the aisles and  supporting himself on the shopping cart. He bought fresh fruit, vegetables, and ingredients for simple meals, foods that would help rebuild his strength after a week of living on soup and crackers.
The outside world felt overwhelming after days of isolation. Colors seemed too bright, sounds too loud, and the brief shopping trip left him exhausted. But it was proof that his body was healing.
On Sunday morning Jay stood in his kitchen and prepared a proper meal, scrambled eggs with fresh herbs, toast made from good bread, and freshly squeezed orange juice that tasted like sunshine after days of cold tea.
The breakfast tasted amazing after endless containers of mediocre takeout soup. Each bite held flavor and substance that reminded him why real food mattered, why taking care of himself was worth the effort even when no one else would notice.
Jay finished his meal and began planning the week ahead. Laundry needed completing, his work clothes required pressing, and he should prepare for whatever had accumulated during his absence. The illness had passed, his strength was returning, and normal life waited to resume.
He cleaned his dishes, putting his kitchen back in proper order. His ability to handle domestic tasks was evidence that he was truly better and not just managing symptoms. By evening, his apartment mirrored his recovery—clean, organized, ready for whatever came next.
## Scene 5
Recovery
Jay stood in front of his bathroom mirror on Monday morning, adjusting the tie. He'd dressed in one of his elegant suits he'd purchased in January—conservative gray that made him look unremarkable. 
He looked pale in the morning light, his face thinner than it had been the previous week. The fever had burned through him completely, but he was functional and ready to return to work.
He arrived at Northlight Financial Center at eight o'clock—a deliberate choice to ease back into his workday.
The elevator ride to the thirty-fourth floor felt unusually long, his legs unsteady from a week of fever-induced inactivity. He'd managed to keep down solid food for two days running, which felt like a victory worth celebrating.
Ian's office was already illuminated when Jay reached his desk, and he could see Ian's silhouette through the glass. The sight brought unexpected comfort—some things, at least, remained constant.
Ian had been in his office since seven-thirty, checking his watch with increasing frequency as eight o'clock approached. When Jay failed to appear at an early hour, a knot of worry had formed in Ian's stomach. The relief he felt seeing Jay emerge from the elevator was massive.
Jay had barely sat on his chair when Ian appeared in his doorway with an expression Jay couldn't quite read.
"Good morning," Jay said. "I'll have your schedule updated within the hour."
"You're back," Ian said.
"Yes." Jay's voice still had a slight rasp, but it was worlds better than the sandpaper croak of the previous week. "I'm sorry for being out so long."
"You look..." Ian paused, clearly editing his words. "How are you feeling?"
"Much better. Thank you for your patience with the sick leave."
"Of course." Ian watched him intensely. Jay knew he didn't look great, but Ian's scrutiny felt like it went deeper than surface observations. "I'll be right back," Ian said abruptly, disappearing into his office.
Jay opened his laptop and began checking emails. A week's worth of messages awaited his attention, but Ian had handled the most urgent matters in his absence.
Ian returned with a large bag that looked suspicious. "Care package," he said, setting it on Jay's desk. "Standard procedure for assistants returning from illness."
Jay opened the package to find an impressive array of items: the same ginger tea that had warmed him during the storm, bottles of vitamins and supplements, packets of dried fruits and nuts, protein drinks, throat lozenges, and what looked like enough cold medicine to stock a pharmacy.
"This is... a lot," Jay said. "Thank you."
"My housekeeper insisted." 
"Standard procedure?"
"Of course."
Jay doubted that Ian had ever given a care package to any previous assistant, but he wasn't about to call attention to the inconsistency. "I appreciate it. Really."
"Make sure you use everything. Full recovery is important."
"I'll make sure to use everything," Jay agreed, though privately he wondered where he'd store it all in his small apartment.
"Good." Ian hesitated, then added, "Don't stay late this week. And don't come in early. Full recovery means proper rest."
"I understand."
As Ian returned to his office and Jay went about his business, he felt a warmth that had nothing to do with the ginger tea he was already brewing. The care package was evidence that his well-being mattered to someone.
The office was deep in the grip of March's demands, with everyone moving at the accelerated pace. Jay eased back into his tasks gradually, prioritizing the important assignments and letting less urgent matters wait.
The rest of the week passed on self-care. Ian insisted Jay maintain regular hours, no early arrivals or late departures until he was fully recovered. Jay didn't argue, recognizing that his previous approach to work-life balance had been unsustainable. Jay arrived at eight and left at five, taking taxis instead of the public transport, ignoring the daily assault on his budget. Despite his scepticism about their effectiveness, he swallowed the vitamins Ian had provided, drank the ginger tea, and went to bed at reasonable hours instead of staying up late to tackle additional work.
It felt strange, prioritizing his health over productivity. But Ian monitored his schedule, and Jay appreciated the gesture.
The work itself was manageable. Jay focused on Ian's most immediate needs. Ian seemed content with this arrangement, never pressing for more than Jay could comfortably handle.
"You're looking better," Amy mentioned on Wednesday, stopping by Jay's desk.
"Thank you. I feel better."
"Good. You scared us disappearing for a week like that."
Jay managed a smile. "I'll try to avoid it in the future."
But despite the recovery, Jay was subdued. The illness had stripped away more than just physical strength, it had reminded him of his fundamental isolation in the city. A week of fever-induced solitude had driven home the reality that he had no safety net beyond his own resources.
The care package from Ian had been a bright spot, but it also highlighted what was missing. Courteous gestures couldn’t fill the void left by the absence of real connections.
Ian noticed Jay's mood and told himself it was simply the lingering effects of illness. People took time to bounce back from the flu, especially when they'd been pushing themselves too hard beforehand. Spring would arrive eventually, bringing longer days and warmer weather, and Jay would recover his spirit.
But privately, Ian worried. Jay's pale complexion and sluggish movement indicated he was fighting to regain his strength. The way he rationed his energy spoke to a deeper exhaustion than simple physical strain.
"Are you sleeping better?" Ian asked on Friday afternoon as Jay prepared to leave.
"Yes, thank you. The supplements are helping."
"Good. Don't push yourself too hard."
Jay nodded and gathered his things. "I'll see you on Monday."
Ian watched him go, fighting the urge to say more. There were questions he wanted to ask, but they would cross lines he'd drawn for good reason. Jay was his assistant, not his friend, and certainly not anything more than that. The concern felt inappropriate, but Ian couldn't shake the feeling that Jay needed more support than he was receiving.
Jay had established a new order—sustainable, healthy, but somehow diminished. He performed his duties with typical competence, but the eager dedication that had once driven him to arrive early and stay late was gone.
Ian told himself this was probably better. More balanced. Healthier. But he missed the Jay who had stayed late by choice, who had brought an atmosphere to the office that Ian was only now realizing he'd come to depend on.
