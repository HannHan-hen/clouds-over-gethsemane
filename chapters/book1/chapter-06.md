# Chapter 6: Regaining ground

## Scene 1: Celebration

On Friday afternoon, the team gathered at the bar not far from their office that had become their unofficial headquarters for celebrations and commiserations. The walls had witnessed countless toasts to promotions and market victories over the years. To most of the team, the polished wood tables and craft cocktail menu felt like an extension of their desks.

For Jay, this marked only his second visit. He had avoided such gatherings during his probationary period, preferring the safety of his apartment to the uncertain dynamics of office socializing. Now, as the guest of honour celebrating his permanent employment, he sat at the end of a long table while his colleagues raised glasses in his direction.

Everyone had come, including Leo. Amy lifted her martini while Kim drank whiskey and Ela sipped wine between animated conversations. Max had ordered something colourful with too many garnishes, and Luc kept the mood light with jokes. Even Zoe had made the effort to attend, despite her general preference for quieter venues.

"To Jay. The first assistant who actually understands what Ian needs before he asks for it," Amy declared.

"That's because he reads the briefing materials instead of just skimming them," Kim added, raising his glass. "Revolutionary concept around here."

Laughter rippled around the table. Jay managed a smile, the kind he had perfected over recent weeks. The conversation moved on to client updates, the celebration becoming a comfortable backdrop to his own thoughts.

Everyone knew. They had all been aware from the beginning that Leo had hired him as another attempt to catch Ian's interest, another pretty face in a long line of failed experiments. While Jay had thrown himself into learning the intricacies of investment portfolios, convinced he was building something meaningful, his colleagues had been watching a performance play out.

Max appeared beside him, sliding into the chair that Zoe had vacated. The senior analyst's expression was puzzled, as if he still couldn't quite understand how his casual comment had landed so poorly.

"Jay, I wanted to explain about what I said when I got back." Max kept his tone conversational as he once again tried to smooth out the situation with his unfortunate comment. "The joke hire thing. I honestly didn't realize you weren't aware of the circumstances."

"It's fine, Max. Really."

"No, it's not. You looked like I'd punched you. Leo's always bringing in attractive assistants for Ian. It's been going on for years. Everyone just assumes new hires know the deal."

Jay focused on the condensation forming on his beer bottle. "I understand now."

"The thing is, none of them ever lasted more than a few weeks. They were either completely unqualified or caused some kind of drama. But you actually do the work. You understand what we do here. That's why you're staying."

"I appreciate you explaining."

Max waited for more, but Jay offered nothing else. After a moment, the older man squeezed his shoulder and returned to his conversation with Ela about upcoming client presentations.

Across the table, Luc caught Jay's eye and tilted his head in a silent question. When Jay responded with another measured smile, Luc looked unconvinced but didn't press. Instead, he smoothly redirected the conversation away from work entirely.

The lounge's entrance chimed, and the atmosphere changed.

Ian Hagen stepped inside. Conversations paused as heads turned. Ian's appearances at casual team events were so rare that it felt like a celebrity sighting. He wore an impeccable suit, though he had loosened his tie—a concession to the informal setting that somehow made him look more formidable instead.

"Ian!" Leo called out. "You actually came."

"Don't make it a regular expectation," Ian replied, accepting the chair that Amy quickly offered him.

"We're celebrating Jay's transition to permanent staff," Ela explained, though Ian clearly understood exactly why he was there.

"Congratulations," Ian said to Jay directly. The word was delivered with the same gravity he reserved for business announcements.

Jay felt heat rise in his cheeks under that direct attention. Ian made the gathering feel official. The fact that he had come at all sent a message that Jay struggled to interpret—was this mere workplace politeness or something more pointed?

The conversation resumed around them, but Ian remained on its periphery, contributing little beyond polite acknowledgements. Jay became conscious of every word he spoke, every reaction he displayed, wondering what Ian was observing and whether he was measuring up to some unspoken standard.

Ian's attendance felt deliberate. He had come here to make a point, though Jay couldn't decipher what that point might be. The man who had maintained distance for three months was now sitting six feet away, validating Jay's worth more deeply than formal contracts and performance reviews ever could.

After an hour, Ian caught Leo's eye and gave him a subtle nod toward the bar area. "Leo. A word."

Leo followed. They positioned themselves near the far end of the bar, far enough from the team's table that their voices wouldn't reach beyond the ambient noise.

"You need to fix this," Ian said, his voice sharpened with the steel that made subordinates straighten their spines.

"Fix what?"

"Don't play ignorant. Jay knows about your little scheme. Max told him he was a joke hire in front of half the office. He's been walking around like a ghost ever since."

"Shit." Leo's casual demeanour faltered. "When?"

"Weeks ago. Months of effort, and he finds out he was hired as entertainment."

"That's not—"

"That's exactly what it was." Ian cut him off smoothly. "And now he doesn't trust anything. His performance review, his permanent status, my assessment of his abilities. He thinks it's all part of some game."

"I didn't mean for him to find out like that. Max has the subtlety of a freight train."

"Max told the truth. You hired him hoping he'd catch my attention, just like all the others."

"Yes, but—"

"But nothing. You created this mess, Leo. The kid actually believed he'd found a place where his work mattered."

"He's good at the job. That has to count for something."

"It does. But try explaining that to someone who discovered he was the butt of an office joke."

Leo's his expression turned from defensive to regretful. "What do you want me to do?"

"Fix it."

"How?"

"You're the one who made him feel like a fool. You're the one who has to convince him he's not. Talk to him. Explain the situation properly. Make him understand that whatever your initial motivations were, his position is based on merit."

Leo nodded slowly. "You really think he'll listen?"

"I think he deserves better than office gossip and half-apologies." Ian turned to head back to the table, then paused. "And Leo? Next time you want to meddle in my personal life, try not to destroy someone else's confidence in the process."

"There won't be a next time."

"Good."

Leo watched Ian walk away, fighting to suppress the smile that threatened to break across his face. Ian was angry on Jay's behalf. The concern in his friend's voice, the way he'd framed Jay's wounded feelings—it all pointed to something Leo had been hoping to see.

## Scene 2: Explanation

As the evening progressed toward midnight, the group began to fragment naturally. Amy and Zoe decided to share a taxi home, while Kim and Ela made plans to continue their night elsewhere. Ian made polite excuses about weekend responsibilities hours ago.

Jay saw his opportunity. He placed money on the table to cover his drinks and edged toward the exit while Luc was engaged in animated discussion with Max.

"Leaving already?"

Jay stopped at the threshold. Leo had materialized beside him, car keys already in hand.

"I should get home. It's been a long week."

"So it has. Come on, I'll drive you."

"That's not necessary. Metro runs all night."

"Metro is unreliable this late on Friday. My car's right outside."

Jay searched Leo's face for traces of the manipulation he now knew had shaped his entire employment. The charm that had once seemed generous now felt calculated. How many conversations had been strategic? How many moments of apparent kindness had served Leo's agenda?

"I appreciate the offer, but I prefer taking the train."

"Jay." Leo's voice had the same inflection he used when redirecting meetings or overruling junior staff suggestions. Not harsh, but unmistakably final. "It's midnight."

The practicality of the argument didn't mask its underlying nature. This wasn't a friendly gesture between colleagues—it was Leo Turner, son of the company owner, making a decision that Jay was expected to accept. The same dynamic that had brought Jay to Turner & Associates in the first place, wrapped in reasonable-sounding concern.

Jay wanted to refuse, to walk away and preserve what little autonomy he could claim. But Leo was already moving toward the door, as if he never doubted that his decisions would be followed. Jay felt powerless as he recognized the futility of resistance.

Leo's BMW waited at the curb, its pristine interior representing more wealth than Jay had ever been close to. The engine started silently, and they merged into the light midnight traffic.

"Address?" Leo asked.

Jay provided directions to his neighbourhood, then focused on the city passing outside his window. The streets felt different at this hour—emptier and stripped of their daytime pretenses.

Leo didn't attempt conversation during the twenty-minute drive, apparently content with the jazz playing through the sound system. Only when they reached Jay's building did he speak again.

"I'm coming up."

"Leo, I'm exhausted. Can we discuss whatever this is on Monday?"

"Five minutes." Leo was already out of the car. "There are things you need to understand."

Jay's apartment occupied the fourth floor of a charming prewar building that maintained its original character despite its age. The absence of a lift meant that residents had to climb a narrow but well-maintained staircase, with walls painted in beige that complemented the building's vintage charm. He unlocked his door and stepped aside, watching Leo inspect the surroundings.

It was a small studio, furnished with carefully chosen pieces placed strategically to maximize the available space. A compact sofa faced a wooden coffee table. To the left, a tiny kitchenette featured white cabinets and a narrow counter, with a small dining table tucked into the corner. A tall bookshelf stood against the far wall, its shelves neatly organized with books, a few practical items and a small plant. The bed remained hidden behind a closet that created the illusion of separate rooms.

Despite the apartment's size constraints, everything was in excellent condition, creating a welcoming and uncluttered atmosphere.

"This is nice," Leo said, his eyes taking in the pristine arrangements. "Very comfortable."

Jay remained near the door, hoping Leo would recognize the hint and make this brief.

Instead, Leo sat on the couch as if he belonged there, his expensive suit a stark contrast against the well maintained but modest furnishings. His earlier casual aura had disappeared entirely.

"You know why I'm here."

"Not really."

"Max told me about your reaction to his comment. You've been different ever since—quieter, more withdrawn. You think you're some kind of a joke."

Jay moved to the kitchen area, filling a glass with water to give his hands something to do. "Aren't I?"

The directness of the question seemed to catch Leo off guard. He ran his fingers through his hair, disturbing its styling.

"Alright. You want complete honesty? Yes, appearance mattered when I hired you. The CFO's assistant is a client-facing position. You'll accompany Ian to meetings, handle client communications, represent the company. Being presentable isn't optional in this business."

"I see."

"But that wasn't the main factor. Ian is... particular. Finding the right assistant for him is incredibly difficult. He needs someone conscientious but also agreeable. Someone who won't push back when he's under pressure or try to manage his decisions for him."

Jay waited, unsure where this was heading.

"The problem is, in our industry, people with impressive credentials often come with equally impressive egos. They're stubborn, argumentative, convinced they know better than their boss. And I'm terrible at reading people during interviews. I make snap judgements that are wrong more often than right. Every assistant I've hired before fell into one of two categories. Either they couldn't handle the workload and crashed within weeks, or they were calculating. They saw Ian as a stepping stone, tried to use their position to advance their own careers or gain inside information. I kept picking people who were good at pretending to be agreeable, but they all had ulterior motives."

"So?"

"The joke hire comment was about my own terrible track record, not your qualifications. But you were different. Despite having modest credentials on paper, you're dedicated. You learned the role thoroughly and perform it better than any of your predecessors. You're exactly what Ian needed, even if I stumbled into hiring you for partially superficial reasons. It's more than I ever hoped to achieve."

Jay stared at his reflection in the kitchen window, processing this information.

"I thought I'd found something real. A place where I belonged because of what I could contribute, not because of how I looked."

"You did find that place."

"Did I? Or am I just another experiment that happened to work out better than expected?"

Leo got up, smoothing his jacket. "That's something you'll have to decide for yourself. But consider this—Ian's never attended a celebration for any previous employee. He came tonight specifically to show that he takes you seriously."

Jay turned from the window. "What do you mean?"

"Ian doesn't do casual appearances. Everything he does has purpose."

The door closed behind Leo, leaving Jay alone in his small apartment. He remained standing in his kitchen, contemplating the conversation and its implications. Leo's explanation had provided answers to questions that had been eating at him, but it had also raised new uncertainties about his place at Turner & Associates.

The safe haven he thought he had found might have been built on foundations he hadn't understood. But perhaps it had evolved into something more authentic.

## Scene 3: Resolve

The whiskey burned its way down Ian's throat, as he sat alone in the muted darkness of his living room. The space around him spoke of wealth and taste—furniture selected by interior designers, art chosen for investment value. It was a home that could appear in architectural magazines, photographed for its clean lines and sophisticated palette. It was also a home where Ian spent as little time as possible.

The silence pressed against him from all sides. No music, no television, no distractions from the thoughts that had been circling his mind since the previous evening. He had deliberately avoided turning on any lights beyond a single lamp in the corner, preferring the half-darkness that matched his mood. The city glittered beyond the windows like scattered diamonds, but he kept his back to the view.

The liquor burned pleasantly as it slid down his throat, each sip a small punishment for his own behavior. He had overstepped. The realization sat uncomfortably in his chest, a foreign sensation that he couldn't dismiss. Thirteen years at Turner & Associates, and he had never once attended an informal team gathering. His absence from such events was so established that colleagues probably assumed he was physically incapable of casual socializing. Yet last night, he had walked into Murphy's like it was the most natural thing in the world. More than that, he had confronted Leo directly, pushing him to explain the circumstances of Jay's hiring. He had essentially demanded that his friend clean up a mess that was causing distress to a subordinate.

The whiskey provided no answers, only the burn that had become a reliable companion over the years. Ian tried to convince himself that his actions stemmed from simple fairness. Jay had been performing his duties competently for three months, only to discover that his colleagues viewed him as the latest iteration of Leo's schemes. Any decent manager would want to correct such a misunderstanding, to ensure that merit was properly recognized. But the explanation felt thin.

Jay had never given him a single reason for suspicion. Three months of observation, of watching for tells and inconsistencies, and Jay had remained exactly what he appeared to be: awkward, reserved, committed to doing good work. There had been no signs of the calculated charm that Sam Connelly had wielded so effectively.

Ian had wanted to catch Jay in some deception. He had been prepared for it, almost eager to confirm his suspicions and validate his defensive instincts. Instead, he had watched a young man throw himself into learning the intricacies of investment management with an enthusiasm that seemed entirely authentic.

The background check Leo had conducted was already detailed, but Ian had commissioned his own investigation through a private firm that specialized in corporate security. The report had been exhaustive, tracing Jay's life from childhood through his employment history. Every reference had been contacted, every claim verified, every gap explained.

The picture that emerged was of a man who had never quite found his place in the world. Teachers remembered him as diligent but socially isolated. University records showed solid academic performance but minimal extracurricular involvement.

His previous employers described him as reliable and conscientious, though two of the departures had been rather abrupt. The details were illuminating beyond what formal documentation could capture. A manager from his first company had mentioned Jay's obvious discomfort around a supervisor who had blatantly sexually harassed him, and HR's dismissive response to his complaints. A colleague from his last job had described how Jay had quit after a coworker's persistent advances made him visibly uncomfortable.

The pattern was consistent: a young man who had learned early that the systems meant to protect him were unreliable, who had developed wariness as a survival mechanism. Ian had never seen anyone look as crushed as Jay had when Max's casual comment revealed the truth about his hiring. The expression of betrayal and humiliation couldn't have been manufactured.

Ian grappled with an uncomfortable realization. Despite his efforts to maintain emotional distance, despite his determination to avoid repeating past mistakes, he had been monitoring Jay with a persistence that showed he cared about the outcome.

More than cared. The admission sat uneasily in his mind, a violation of the defences he had constructed over the years. He had been watching Jay not just for signs of deception, but for signs of well-being. He had noticed when Jay's initial enthusiasm began to fade, when his eager questions became more cautious, when his posture grew more defensive. Ian had told himself he was simply observing a potential threat, but it was more complicated.

He had been concerned.

The realization demanded action, though Ian wasn't sure what form that action should take. Jay deserved better than the impersonal supervision he had received. Ian could provide guidance without compromising himself. He could provide support without risking emotional entanglement. It was possible to be fair, supportive, and decent while maintaining the distance that protected them both.

The whiskey had grown warm in his hand, its expensive taste wasted on his distracted palate. He set it aside and walked to the windows. Somewhere out there, Jay was probably struggling with his own questions about belonging and worth, questions that Ian could help answer through proper mentorship. Nothing intimate, nothing that would muddy the lines they both needed to maintain. Just guidance that Jay had been seeking from the beginning, that Ian should have been providing all along.

Even if the ache in his chest pointed at motivations that went beyond obligation, Ian understood the practical realities. Jay's history made him vulnerable, which called for protection, not romantic advances. The difference in their social standing, their ages, the power imbalance between them—all of it created a situation where any personal interest would be inappropriate at best, harmful at worst. He wouldn't allow idle fantasies to compromise his judgment or Jay's well-being.

But he could be the mentor that Jay had hoped to find when he first started at Turner & Associates. He could live up to the admiration he had seen in Jay's eyes during those early weeks, before disillusionment had replaced hope with resignation.

The city lights stretched endlessly before him, each one representing dreams and ambitions and the endless human pursuit of something better. Ian had long ago stopped believing in such optimism for himself, but he could still recognize its value in others. He would do better. Not for the sake of connection or intimacy, but for the sake of his own integrity.

Ian returned to his chair and picked up his glass. There was work to be done, relationships to repair, and a young man's faith in mentorship to restore. Ian could do that much, at least. Even if he couldn't—wouldn't—allow himself to want anything more.

## Scene 4: Hope

On Monday morning, Jay was at his desk at seven-thirty. He organized his work and began tackling each task in order. But the office atmosphere was different, as if the weekend had reset more than just the calendar.

Ian arrived just before eight. Nothing in his demeanor hinted that Friday night had been anything out of the ordinary.

"Good morning," Ian said, pausing at Jay's desk.

"Good morning."

"I wanted to follow up on last week's portfolio summary. The analysis was detailed and the recommendations sound. Well done."

Jay felt heat rise in his cheeks. "Thank you."

"I've scheduled a meeting with the client tomorrow morning. I'd like you to prepare supplementary materials—risk assessments and performance projections for the reallocations."

"Of course. I'll have everything ready by end of business today."

"If you have questions about the projections, don't hesitate to ask. The client can be particular about presentation format."

"I will. Thank you."

Ian moved on to his office, leaving Jay with the tasks of research and analysis. The morning passed uneventfully. Phone calls were answered, emails were processed, and the financial management continued without drama.

"Morning, Jay," Max cheerfully called from the elevator. "How was your weekend?"

"Quiet. Productive." Jay looked up from his screen, offering a smile. "Yours?"

"Caught up on some reading. Nothing exciting."

Max continued toward his office, leaving Jay with the distinct impression that the awkwardness between them had dissolved. It was, he realized, a simple interaction that had always characterized their workplace—straightforward, without hidden agendas.

Twenty minutes later, Luc appeared by Jay's desk, holding his coffee mug.

"Heading to the kitchen for coffee. Want to come?"

Jay looked up and nodded. "Sure, I'll join you."

"Excellent. I was hoping someone would save me from my own company."

Luc led the way down the short corridor, and Jay fell into step beside him. They reached the kitchen doorway together and were greeted by the aroma of fresh coffee as they stepped inside. Jay prepared his coffee while Luc leaned against the counter.

"You seem better today," Luc observed.

"Do I?"

"Less like you're waiting for something terrible to happen."

"Maybe I was."

"Understandable. New jobs can be stressful until you figure out how everything works."

The simplicity of the explanation struck Jay as accurate. He had been waiting for something terrible to happen—not because the job was new, but because experience had taught him that security was temporary, that kindness came with conditions he couldn't meet.

But looking around the kitchen, Jay wondered if he had been preparing for disasters that existed only in his imagination.

At noon, Amy appeared at his desk. "Lunch at Willow & Sage?"

"Sure."

The brisk walk from the office felt invigorating, and once they sat at a large table, the bistro seemed even cosier.

"It's like a freezer in my flat. Maintenance says they'll get to it next week. Next week, my ass," Ela complained, tugging her scarf loose but keeping it draped around her shoulders.

"You should move into my building," Zoe said, flipping through the menu without looking up. "Heating's reliable, and there's a bakery downstairs. You'd live on croissants."

"Tempting," Ela admitted.

"Speaking of temptation—there's a place I found last weekend. Handmade pasta, truffle oil on everything. You'd love it, Amy. The plating alone is art," Zoe continued.

"I'm in," Ela said immediately. "As long as I can feel my fingers while I'm eating."

The conversation flowed around personal topics. No one put Jay on the spot or demanded his participation, but space was left for him to contribute when he chose to. When Amy asked about his thoughts on a recent market development, he offered his analysis without feeling like he was being tested.

The food was good as always—rich and well-prepared. Jay ate with appetite, unlike the robotic chewing that had characterized most of his meals lately.

"I hadn't realized how much I missed being here," he said to Amy as they walked back to the office.

Jay approached the afternoon tasks with mild enthusiasm. The portfolio projections required careful formatting, a detailed assignment that he had always enjoyed.

When he finished the supplementary materials an hour before the official end of business, he felt pride in his analysis. The risk assessments were comprehensive and the presentation format was polished.

"Everything ready for tomorrow?" Ian asked, appearing at his desk as Jay was organizing the final documents.

"All set. I included alternative scenarios for the more volatile holdings."

Ian accepted the folder and spent several minutes reviewing the contents.

"This is excellent work," Ian said finally. "Exactly what the client will need to make informed decisions."

"Thank you."

Jay felt warmth unfurl in his chest, a sensation he had almost forgotten was possible. Not just relief at avoiding criticism, but satisfaction at work well done and properly recognized.

Nothing had changed—his responsibilities were identical, his colleagues were the same people they had been on Friday. But the lens through which he viewed these constant elements had changed. Max's cheerful greeting was simply friendliness, not a test of his ability to fit in. Luc's invitation to the kitchen was casual camaraderie, not a judgement of his social skills.

Ian's demeanour was strictly businesslike, but it was never unkind.

Jay had been so prepared for mistreatment that he had interpreted ordinary interactions as potentially hostile. The revelation was both embarrassing and liberating.

Maybe he'd let himself be overly dramatic, allowing the humiliating circumstances of his hiring tint everything that came after. In reality, no one else seemed to care, his colleagues treating him like any other new hire. The only unpleasant thing that had happened to him was Max's initial thoughtless comment, and Max had apologized once he realized his mistake.

Perhaps he'd misread the rest—the perceived coldness, the sense of being on the periphery—and the office was simply what it seemed: civil, capable people.

The test of this new perspective came unexpectedly on Tuseday morning when Ian stopped by his desk with a request that made Jay's stomach drop.

"I have a client meeting at two o'clock. Mayfield wants to review their portfolio allocation. I'd like you to attend and take notes."

Jay felt his composure falter. "You want me in the meeting?"

"Yes. It will be good experience for you to observe how client relationships are managed. Bring your laptop."

After Ian returned to his office, Jay spent the morning in barely controlled panic. He had never attended a client meeting before—at least, not in any meaningful sense. The Hartwell negotiation technically counted, but he'd spent most of it in the background fetching documents and trying not to be noticed. This would be different. He'd be sitting at the table, expected to follow along.

While he'd had minor interactions with clients, answering phones, replying to emails, occasionally greeting them at reception or escorting them to conference rooms, he had never actually been part of a meeting as a participant, face-to-face with the wealthy investors who comprised Turner & Associates' clientele. What if he said something inappropriate?

At one-fifty, Jay gathered his laptop and headed for the conference room. Ian was already there, reviewing documents, when Jay entered.

"Take a seat near the back. You're here to observe and record."

Mayfield representatives arrived promptly—three middle-aged executives in expensive suits who greeted Ian warmly. Jay remained silent in his corner, trying to project competence while his pulse hammered in his ears.

The meeting proceeded exactly as advertised: a review of investment performance, strategic adjustments, and market projections. Jay dutifully recorded the key points, relieved that the discussion followed predictable patterns that made note-taking manageable. Ian fielded questions and provided detailed explanations without once glancing in Jay's direction.

When the clients left forty-five minutes later, Jay felt drained but proud. He had managed to sit through his first high-level client meeting without embarrassing himself or Ian.

"Could you prepare a brief summary of the key action items we discussed?" Ian asked once they were alone.

Jay spent the next hour crafting a concise overview of the meeting's outcomes, double-checking his notes to ensure accuracy. When he delivered the summary to Ian's office, he watched nervously as Ian read through it.

"This is exactly what I needed. Clear and well-organized. Thank you."

As Jay prepared to leave for the day, cleaning up his desk and reviewing tomorrow's schedule, he felt something he hadn't expected to feel: cautious optimism. Not the desperate hope that had characterized his early weeks, but a timid belief that he might actually belong here after all.

## Scene 5: Trust

The days since Monday had slipped by, each one pushing Jay a little further from the shock of learning the truth of his hiring. He remained subdued, though the tight knot of anxiety in his chest had loosened. Thursday unfolded in the same way as any other workday, but by three-thirty that afternoon, the atmosphere changed.

Jay heard the commotion before he saw it—urgent phone calls, rapid conversations, the loud sound of keyboards. Amy rushed past his desk with a stack of files, her normally composed expression strained.

"What's happening?" Jay asked Luc, who was pulling documents from a filing cabinet with unusual speed.

"Fairfield Industries. Their board meeting got moved up to tomorrow morning, and they need our full portfolio analysis tonight." Luc grabbed another folder. "Ian's coordinating the response."

Jay recognized the name immediately. Fairfield Industries was one of their most important clients—one that Ian had brought in himself nearly a decade ago and still managed personally. Everyone in the office understood what that meant: every report, every analysis for Fairfield had to be flawless. There was no margin for error.

Jay watched Ian emerge from his office, moving through the chaos with the same calm he always displayed. He spoke briefly to Max, then Amy, systematically assigning tasks. The office erupted into motion, dominated by a sudden surge of restlessness unlike anything Jay had seen there.

"Jay." Ian's voice cut through the activity. Jay looked up to find Ian standing beside his desk. "I need you to stay late tonight. We have documentation to compile for the Fairfield presentation. Are you available?"

The request was direct and businesslike. Jay felt a flutter of something—not quite nervousness, but heightened awareness. This was the first time Ian had personally asked him to handle something beyond ordinary tasks.

"Of course," Jay said. "What do you need me to do?"

"Start with the quarterly reports from the last twelve months. Pull the relevant sections and organize them chronologically. I'll have the specific parameters ready in twenty minutes."

Ian returned to his office, leaving Jay to gather the necessary files. Around him, the office buzzed with urgency. Even Kim worked without complaint, double-checking the secure connection for Fairfield and monitoring the data transfer to make sure nothing went wrong at the last minute. Jay got caught up in the momentum, relieved to have clear direction and a concrete role to play.

The next three hours were consumed by paperwork and numbers. Jay compiled reports and organized materials according to Ian's specifications. The work was demanding, leaving no room for his self-consciousness. When other colleagues finished their portions and departed, Jay barely noticed. He was absorbed in the task, determined to complete it properly.

At half past ten, he encountered a problem. A file contained a reference to a subsidiary acquisition that didn't match the timeline in the reports. Jay stared at the discrepancy, uncertain whether he'd made an error or if the documents themselves were inconsistent. He checked his work twice, but the numbers refused to align.

The office had grown quiet. Only a few lights remained on, casting long shadows across empty desks. Jay could see Ian working in his office, illuminated by the glow of his computer screen. The memory of their past awkward interaction—his ill-timed question about the acquisition, Ian's swift dismissal—made him hesitate. But the deadline loomed, and he couldn't resolve the discrepancy alone.

Jay approached Ian's office and knocked on the open door. Ian looked up from his screen.

"I'm having trouble with the timeline," Jay said. "There's a discrepancy in the acquisition dates that I can't reconcile."

Ian saved his work and turned to face him completely. "Show me."

Jay laid out the documents on Ian's desk, pointing to the conflicting information. Ian examined the papers with a focused expression.

"This subsidiary was acquired through a shell company," Ian explained, pulling up additional files on his computer. "The official filing date doesn't reflect the actual transaction date. See here—" He pointed to a specific line in the contract. "The effective date is backdated to align with the fiscal quarter. That's why the timeline appears inconsistent."

Ian walked him through the reasoning. The explanation was detailed, delivered without the slightest hint of impatience. Ian answered Jay's follow-up questions, ensuring Jay understood not just the situation but the full history.

"Does that resolve the issue?" Ian asked.

"Yes, completely. Thank you."

Ian returned to his computer, and Jay gathered the documents. The interaction had been exactly what it appeared to be—a manager helping an employee solve a problem. No hidden irritation, just competent guidance.

They worked side by side for another hour, alone in the office. Jay finished his portion of the documentation and began preparing the final presentation folder. Ian reviewed each section, making minor adjustments and additions.

At eleven-fourty, Ian closed his laptop and got up. "That should be sufficient for tomorrow's meeting."

Jay gathered his things, feeling exhausted but also satisfied from work completed properly. As he reached for his coat, Ian spoke again.

"Good work tonight."

The acknowledgement was brief. Jay nodded his thanks and headed for the elevator. Outside, night had already fallen, leaving just sparse headlights on the road and the occasional passerby.

Jay walked to the metro station. The evening replayed in his mind—not the crisis or the long hours, but the moment when he'd needed help and received it. Ian's response had been exactly what a good manager should provide, professional and supportive.

The realization dawned on him gradually as he waited for the train. He had been living with a tension he hadn't fully acknowledged—the expectation of disappointment, the anticipation of rejection. But tonight wad different. When he'd needed guidance, he'd received it. When he'd completed his work, it had been acknowledged.

As the train pulled into the station, Jay caught himself thinking something he hadn't dared to consider in weeks. "Maybe I don't have to keep flinching. Maybe, in this one small corner of the world, I can actually just do my job."
