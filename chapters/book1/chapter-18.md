# Chapter 18: Artistic merits
## Scene 1
After the retreat
The Monday morning was unlike anything Jay had experienced at Turner & Associates. The office buzzed with animated conversations and bursts of laughter. People clustered around computers, viewing the photo albums HR had posted overnight, and the casual atmosphere made everything feel more like a party than a workplace.
"Jay, come look at this. You can actually see the moment you stopped panicking and started enjoying yourself," Zoe called from her desk, where she'd pulled up footage from the diving session.
Jay walked over, grinning at the screen. "I look terrified in that first shot."
"You were terrified. But you got over it fast. Natural instincts, maybe?" Luc added, appearing with coffee.
"Hardly. I was just following Zoe's instructions. You mentioned there are places in the city where beginners can dive?" Jay turned to her.
"Absolutely. There's a fantastic pool facility about twenty minutes from here that offers certification courses. The instructors are excellent, and they have equipment rental. I could give you the details if you're interested," Zoe said, her face lit up.
"I think I am interested. It was incredible down there. The whole experience," Jay said, the words surprising him even as they left his mouth.
"Are we still talking about the diving? Because I'm pretty sure everyone saw Ian basically turn into a personal instructor for you," Kim wandered over with his own coffee, catching the end of their conversation.
"He was just being helpful," Jay replied, though he felt warmth creep up his neck.
"Ian doesn't do helpful for most people. Must have been your natural charm," Amy observed from her nearby desk.
Jay might have once taken the teasing as pointed, but now it felt good-natured. "More likely he didn't want to explain to HR why his assistant drowned during a company retreat."
Their laughter drew more people over, and soon they were all rehashing various moments from the weekend. The atmosphere remained loose through the morning, with work getting done but at a leisurely pace that acknowledged everyone's post-retreat mood.
Lunch extended well beyond the usual hour as conversations continued. Jay was at the center of one particularly animated discussion about the art exhibition.
"I still can't believe you'd never heard of mixed media installations. How is that even possible?" Ela said, shaking her head in mock despair.
"Very easily. I know absolutely nothing about art. I walked through that entire exhibition feeling completely lost," Jay replied with a self-deprecating smile.
"But you seemed engaged when we were there," Zoe pointed out.
"I was engaged. It was fascinating. I just had no idea what I was looking at or why it was supposed to be important."
"Art appreciation isn't innate. It's learned. You pick it up through exposure," Max chimed in.
"Or you don't. Some of us are hopeless cases," Jay said cheerfully.
Meanwhile, Luc had been practically bouncing in his seat throughout lunch, clearly bursting to share something. "I have to tell you all about these concert tickets. My girlfriend nearly fainted when I told her what we won."
"What's the big deal? It's just a concert, right?" Jay asked.
The table went quiet for a moment, then erupted in collective disbelief.
"Just a concert? Jay, these tickets are impossible to get. The artist only performs maybe ten times a year, always in tiny venues. People pay thousands on the secondary market," Kim said.
"I've literally never heard of them," Jay admitted.
"That's because they don't do commercial releases. Everything is limited edition, vinyl only, sold exclusively at performances. It's like this whole underground art scene thing," Amy explained.
Luc nodded enthusiastically. "The waiting list for tickets is supposedly years long. My girlfriend has been trying to get in since college."
Jay looked around the table, puzzled. "So what kind of music is it?"
"Experimental electronic with classical influences. Very atmospheric, very cerebral," Ela said.
"That sounds... not like something I'd understand," Jay said, tying to find diplomatic words.
This admission triggered another wave of laughter, but it felt warm. Jay was surprised by how comfortable he felt being the target of their amusement.
"We could educate you. Start with some basics, work up to the complex stuff," Ela suggested.
"I appreciate the offer, but I think I'll stick to what I know. Which apparently isn't much," Jay replied.
When lunch finally ended and everyone returned to the office, Jay felt a flutter of anxiety. He'd been putting off his conversation with Ian all morning, but it couldn't wait much longer. The graduation was only a few weeks away, and he needed to make arrangements. Jay knocked on the doorframe of Ian's office.
"Do you have a minute?"
Ian looked up, gesturing to the chair across from his desk. "Of course. What do you need?"
Jay sat down, suddenly feeling awkward. "I wanted to request a day off. It's for a family thing, my half-sister's graduation. In June."
He fumbled in his pocket for his phone, checking the date. "June twenty-fourth. It's a Friday. Assuming that's acceptable."
Ian looked at for a long moment, and Jay felt his confidence waver. Maybe this was presumptuous after all. Maybe he'd misread how things worked here.
"Where is the graduation?" Ian asked finally.
"My hometown. About four hours south. Just family obligations, you know. I haven't seen them in a while, and my mother..." Jay trailed off, realizing he was rambling.
"That's fine. Mark it on the calendar and notify HR. Do you need to borrow a company car for the trip?"
Jay was caught off guard. "A company car? I couldn't possibly—"
"Why not?"
"It just seems inappropriate. Using company resources for personal travel."
"It's standard procedure. Employees borrow company vehicles for personal needs regularly. There's a whole protocol for it."
"There is?"
"Check the employee handbook. Section twelve, I believe. Fleet vehicle policies."
Jay fidgeted in his chair, feeling out of his depth again. "I'm not the most confident driver, especially on highways."
"The cars are well-maintained and insured. If you're comfortable driving in the city, highway driving isn't much different."
"I'll consider it. Thank you for approving the time off."
"Of course. Family commitments are important."
Jay stood to leave, then paused. "Should I let you know about the car situation by a certain date?"
"A few days' notice is sufficient. The vehicles are usually available."
Walking back to his desk, Jay pulled out his phone and composed a quick text to his mother: "I'll be there for Ema's graduation. Driving down Friday morning, back Saturday."
Her response came within minutes: "Wonderful! Can't wait to see you. Ema will be so thrilled. We have so much to catch up on!"
Jay stared at the enthusiastic message, and he discovered he looked forward to the visit despite his reservations. Maybe this trip home wouldn't be as complicated as he'd imagined. Maybe, like everything else lately, it would turn out better than expected.
The afternoon passed quickly, work flowing smoothly after the relaxed morning. As people began packing up for the day, the retreat continued to provide conversation material. Someone had apparently started a group chat for sharing additional photos, and Jay was included without being asked.
"Check your phone," Zoe called over as she gathered her things. "I sent you that diving information."
Jay pulled up her message, finding a detailed list of facilities, instructors, and beginner programs. 
"This is incredibly helpful. Thank you."
"Let me know if you decide to try it. I'd be happy to go with you for moral support."
As the office emptied, Jay worked slightly later than usual, making up for the extended lunch and generally leisurely pace of the day. When he finally packed up, the building felt unusually comfortable.

## Scene 2
Tickets
The retreat faded from conversation faster than Jay expected. By Wednesday, the diving stories and treasure hunt victories had been replaced entirely by intense discussions about the concert tickets. What started as casual mentions over coffee breaks had evolved into the primary topic at every lunch, and Jay was surprised by how invested everyone seemed.
"I still can't believe we actually won these," Luc said for what felt like the dozenth time as they sat in a new restaurant they'd discovered recently. "My girlfriend practically screamed when I told her. She's been following this artist since their first EP."
"How did you even hear about them?" Jay asked, still puzzled by the whole phenomenon.
"Underground music blogs, mostly. Word of mouth. The exclusivity is part of the appeal."
Kim, who Jay had never pegged as someone interested in experimental music, was equally enthusiastic. "The production quality is supposed to be incredible. They use custom sound systems, specially designed venues. It's more like an art installation than a traditional concert."
"Which explains why it's in a basement," Ela added with a grin. "Industrial chic is very on-brand for this scene."
Jay tried to imagine Ela, with her designer clothes and deluxe handbags, in what Luc had described as an underground club. The mental image didn't compute.
"We need to talk to Ian about his tickets," Kim said suddenly. "I mean, he's probably not planning to use them, right?"
"You can't just ask the CFO for his concert tickets," Amy protested.
"Why not? Worst case, he says no."
Max, who'd been quietly working through his curry, looked up. "Ian's reasonable about these things. If he's not interested, he'll probably just give them away."
The opportunity presented itself later that afternoon when Max encountered Ian at the coffee machine. Jay happened to be refilling his water bottle nearby and witnessed the entire exchange.
"Ian, about those concert tickets. Any chance you're planning to use them?"
"I hadn't really considered it. Why?"
"Well, Kim and Ela were hoping to go. And honestly, it seems like more of a group thing at this point."
"Kim and Ela want them?"
Max gestured toward the main office area, where Kim and Ela were huddled over Ela's computer, presumably looking at something related to the concert. "They're pretty excited about it."
Ian watched them for a moment, then turned back to Max. "They can have them."
"Just like that?"
"It's not really my type of event. Better that someone who'll appreciate it should go."
Kim and Ela's reaction when Max delivered the news was almost comical. Ela clapped her hands together, and Kim broke into a wide smile.
"This is perfect," Ela announced. "Kim knows all about the technical aspects, and I'm curious about the artistic vision. We'll complement each other's perspectives."
Jay watched the exchange with growing bemusement. "I had no idea you were into experimental music, Kim."
"There's a lot about me people don't know," Kim replied with a shrug. "I've been following electronic music production techniques for years. This artist is supposedly seriously challenging conventions."
By Friday's lunch the final arrangements had crystallized. Luc would attend with his girlfriend, Kim and Ela would use Ian's tickets, and Max had decided to give one of his tickets to Amy.
"My wife thinks it sounds pretentious," Max explained cheerfully. "And Amy's husband isn't the experimental music type either. So we figured, why not make it a company outing?"
Amy laughed. "He would rather spend the evening reorganizing our tax documents. He actively avoids anything he calls artistic."
That left Jay with his two tickets and no obvious companion. He'd been mulling over the situation all week, not particularly concerned but aware that everyone expected him to attend.
"Zoe, you should take my extra ticket," he offered as they waited for their food.
Zoe shook her head immediately. "Thanks, but no. I'm really more of an outdoors person. Give me a hiking trail or a diving reef over a basement club any day."
"Are you sure? Everyone else seems to think it's going to be amazing."
"I'm sure it will be, for people who are into that scene. But I've got plans anyway, mountain climbing weekend with some friends from my old job."
Everyone accepted her refusal. Jay wasn't particularly invested in finding a companion, and while the idea of experiencing something completely new had a certain appeal, he wasn't all convinced he even wanted to go. "I don't really have anyone to bring. If someone wants my tickets..."
"Absolutely not," Max interjected firmly. "This is basically a team event at this point. You have to come."
The conversation continued as their food arrived, and by the end of lunch, it had been decided that Jay's attendance was not optional. More surprisingly, Max had somehow roped Ian into the plan as well.
"It was his puzzle-solving that won us the tickets in the first place. It's only fair that he should experience the reward."
Jay wasn't present for that particular negotiation, but Ian's capitulation surprised everyone. By Friday afternoon, the plan was set: the entire team would attend, minus Zoe, plus Luc's girlfriend.
"It's next Friday at nine," Luc informed Jay as they packed up for the weekend. "The venue is called Substrate. It's in this industrial space in the art district. Very underground, very casual."
"What exactly does that mean?"
"Exposed pipes, concrete floors, dramatic lighting. The crowd will be pretty alternative, lots of black clothing, creative types, art students, music industry people."
Jay tried to imagine himself in such an environment. "What should I wear?"
"Whatever you're comfortable in. It's not like there's a dress code, but most people go for the scene look. Dark colours, interesting textures, that sort of thing."
"Scene look?"
Luc grinned. "You know, whatever aesthetic they're into. Goth, punk, avant-garde fashion, vintage counterculture stuff. It's part of the whole experience. Just avoid anything too corporate."
As Jay rode the metro home that evening, he thought about how much he'd learned about his teammates over the past week. Luc's girlfriend was apparently a serious music enthusiast with encyclopedic knowledge of underground artists. Kim had revealed an unexpected passion for sound engineering and music production. Ela, despite her polished appearance, was excited about experiencing something edgy and unconventional.
Max and Amy seemed more opportunistic about the whole thing, happy to try something new and spend time with colleagues outside the office. Their approach felt more relatable to Jay, who was curious but not particularly invested in the artistic merits of experimental electronic music.
Ian's decision to attend was the most puzzling. He'd seemed indifferent to the tickets when he'd given them to Kim and Ela, yet he'd eventually agreed to Max's pressure to join the group. Jay couldn't imagine Ian in an underground club, surrounded by art students, but then again, Ian had surprised him before.
Meanwhile, Ian sat in his penthouse that same evening, questioning his decision. He'd told himself it was a reasonable team-building exercise, a way to show support for the group dynamic. But he knew the real reason he'd agreed to go, and it had everything to do with his curiosity about Jay's reactions to new experiences.
He knew it was a dangerous indulgence. His resolve to maintain distance had been steadily eroding, and deliberately placing himself in a social situation with Jay was probably the opposite of prudent. But the rationalization came easily: it was a work-related event, attended by the entire team. Nothing inappropriate about supporting office morale.
Even as he made the argument to himself, Ian knew he was compromising his own rules. But the temptation to see Jay in yet another new environment was stronger than his caution.
## Scene 3
Concert night
The week passed quickly, and Friday evening arrived before Jay had properly figured out what to wear. His casual wardrobe was limited and showing its age, but he decided against overthinking the situation. He'd considered buying something new but couldn't justify the expense for one event, especially when he had no idea what would be appropriate anyway.
He wore his least faded jeans, a plain black t-shirt, and his gym sneakers. Comfort seemed more important than whatever constituted "scene" fashion. Hopefully the alternative crowd would be forgiving of his shortcomings.
The team had arranged to meet at a sleek bar close to the venue, at eight o'clock. Jay arrived precisely on time to find Max and Amy already claiming a table, both dressed in what could generously be called business casual.
"You look sensible," Amy observed approvingly as Jay joined them. "I was worried I'd under-dressed."
"Drink?" Max offered, gesturing toward the bar. 
"Beer sounds good," Jay replied, happy for something to occupy his hands.
Luc appeared next with his girlfriend, who was undeniably gorgeous and in an extravagant dress that managed to be both elegant and edgy. She radiated excitement about the evening, but Jay couldn't help noticing the undercurrent of tension between them. 
Luc had turned himself into a walking advertisement for leather accessories, with an impressive array of belts, chains, and buckles adorning his black outfit.
"I told him the chains were excessive," his girlfriend announced to the table. "But does he listen? Never."
"You love my chains," Luc protested, sitting on a chair with a metallic clanking sound.
"I tolerate your chains. There's a difference."
Jay buried his face in his beer, trying to escape the awkwardness of witnessing their bickering. This was exactly the relationship dynamic that made him glad to be single.
Kim and Ela arrived moments later, both sporting dark eye makeup and wearing matching leather jackets over dramatically torn jeans that looked like they'd been coordinated down to the last zipper. The effect was so deliberately over-the-top that it had to be intentional.
"Please tell me this is some kind of inside joke," Jay said.
Ela grinned. "We decided if we were going to do this, we might as well commit to the aesthetic."
"You look like you're in a band," Amy observed with amusement.
"That's the idea," Kim replied, clearly pleased with the effect.
Luc studied Jay's outfit with theatrical concentration. "Normalcore," he announced finally. "Very cutting edge. The vibe is exactly what the scene needs right now."
Jay had no idea what normalcore meant, but he nodded as if it made perfect sense.
Ian appeared just as they were finishing their first round of drinks, and Jay had to suppress a double-take. Gone was the usual immaculate suit, replaced by what was clearly an expensive ensemble of dark slacks, a fitted black shirt and a jacket. The effect was striking. It was unmistakably designer, unmistakably elegant, and somehow managed to look both casual and formal simultaneously.
"Sorry I'm late," Ian said, claiming the remaining chair. "Traffic was heavier than expected."
Jay stole glances, trying not to be obvious about it. He made a point of not thinking about Ian's appearance, but this outfit made it impossible to ignore how attractive his boss actually was.
They finished their drinks amid increasingly animated conversation, with Luc's girlfriend providing a running commentary on the artist's previous performances, discography, and artistic evolution. Her enthusiasm was infectious, even if most of the technical details went over Jay's head.
When they finally made their way to Substrate, Jay trailed at the back of the group. Max and Ian had fallen into what sounded like a good-natured argument about municipal bond strategies, while the others chattered excitedly about what to expect from the performance.
The venue lived up to its underground reputation. They descended concrete steps into a converted basement space where exposed pipes and industrial lighting created exactly the aesthetic Luc had described. The crowd was smaller than Jay had expected, but every person seemed to embody some version of artistic expression, from elaborate makeup to avant-garde clothing combinations.
"There you are!" a familiar voice called out.
Jay turned to see Leo approaching with an elegantly dressed woman on his arm. Leo looked perfectly at home in the underground setting, which somehow wasn't surprising.
"I was hoping you'd all make it," Leo continued, beaming at the group. "Come on, I'll get you set up with good spots."
"What are you doing here?" Ian asked with suspicion.
"Same as you, I imagine." Leo's smile was entirely too innocent. "Though I have to admit, putting these prizes in the hunt was my idea. I thought we might enjoy something a bit different."
Ian's eyes narrowed. "How convenient."
"Isn't it?" Leo replied cheerfully, apparently oblivious to Ian's scepticism.
Ian's expression made it clear he wasn't buying this explanation, but Leo had already moved on, guiding them toward a cluster of plush couches near the performance area. Jay suspected Leo might actually own the venue, given how confidently he moved around the space and spoke to the staff.
"Best seats in the house," he announced. "Well, best couches. There aren't really seats."
They arranged themselves across several low couches with an excellent view of the makeshift stage in the center of the room, drinks in hand, as the performance space gradually filled with an audience that Jay estimated at maybe two hundred people. The exclusivity that everyone had mentioned was immediately apparent—this felt more like a private gathering than a commercial concert.
The performer was surrounded by an elaborate array of equipment that had Kim practically vibrating with excitement. "Look at that setup," he murmured to Ela. "That's a custom modular synthesizer."
The music was unlike anything Jay had experienced. It was aggressively experimental—layered electronic sounds that seemed to follow no recognizable structure, punctuated by periods of silence and sudden bursts of noise, accompanied by lighting effects that ranged from strobing intensity to near-complete darkness. The volume was punishing, and Jay felt a headache within the first fifteen minutes.
He glanced around at his colleagues. Luc and his girlfriend were swaying to rhythms Jay couldn't identify, while Kim and Ela sat with the focused attention of students analysing a complex theorem. Max and Amy looked politely interested but not particularly engaged.
Ian, seated nearby with his drink untouched, appeared to be barely enduring the experience.
## Scene 4
Respite
After what felt like an eternity but was probably only thirty minutes, Jay decided he needed a break. He excused himself and made his way to the bar at the far end of the venue.
The noise level dropped once he got some distance from the speakers, and he gratefully ordered a whiskey despite knowing he'd hate the taste. Ian liked whiskey, though, which somehow made Jay's feelings about the drink warmer than they should be. The bartender poured a generous measure of something that smelled harsh and medicinal.
He was halfway through the glass, trying to look like someone who belonged in an underground club, when Ian appeared beside him.
"So I'm not the only one who had the same idea," Ian said, gesturing to the bartender. "Whiskey, please. Whatever you have that's actually drinkable."
The bartender produced a different bottle, and Ian sampled it cautiously. He looked disappointed.
"Well. It's better than the music," Ian said, sitting on the adjacent bar stool.
Jay felt a surge of relief at finding someone who shared his lack of enthusiasm. "I was beginning to think I was completely uncultured."
"High art is frequently indistinguishable from elaborate practical jokes," Ian replied.
"The noise was getting to me. I thought maybe some distance would help."
Ian drank and made a face. "This is terrible quality."
"I don't actually like whiskey at all. I just thought it seemed appropriate for the setting," Jay admitted.
"Appropriate for what? Punishing ourselves?"
Jay laughed, surprised by Ian's dry humour. "I guess high art is lost on me. I feel like I should be having some kind of profound experience, but mostly I just want the volume turned down."
"If it helps, I'm equally unimpressed. Though I suspect admitting that makes us philistines."
"What kind of music do you like?"
"Classical, mostly. Occupational hazard of the upbringing I had. I actually play violin."
Jay stared at him, momentarily speechless. "You play violin?"
"Played. I haven't touched it seriously in years."
"That's incredible. I should have guessed. You seem like someone who'd have classical training."
"Every privileged child's burden. My parents insisted on lessons from age five. I hated every minute of it as a child, wanted to play outside instead of practising scales," Ian said with a self-deprecating smile.
"But you kept playing?"
"Through college, yes. I was actually quite good, for a while. But it's not like riding a bicycle—without constant practice, the skills deteriorate rapidly. I play occasionally now, just to keep my fingers from forgetting completely, but I'm nowhere near performance level."
Jay listened with fascination, trying to imagine Ian as a child forced into music lessons, then as a young man skilled enough to perform publicly. It explained a lot about his composure.
"Do you miss it?"
"Sometimes. There's something meditative about playing well, when muscle memory takes over and you stop thinking about technique. But it takes years to reach that level, and more years to maintain it. What about you? What kind of music do you enjoy?"
"I don't really have preferences. I listen to whatever's on the radio, but I never pay attention to who's performing or what genre it is. I'm probably the least musical person you'll ever meet."
"I doubt that's true."
"You know what this reminds me of?" Jay said, gesturing toward the exposed pipes and concrete aesthetic. "The laundromat in my building's basement. Same industrial pipes, same dampness, same inexplicably loud mechanical noises. I've never understood why anyone would voluntarily spend time in an environment that feels like doing chores."
This observation sent Ian into laughter, a spontaneous reaction Jay had rarely witnessed from him. "That's remarkably apt. Though I suspect saying so would get us expelled from the artistic community."
"Our secret," Jay agreed solemnly.
They spent the remainder of the performance at the bar, occasionally commenting on the music and comparing their shared bewilderment at the venue's appeal. The conversation felt natural, more so than their office interactions ever managed, as if the bizarre environment had temporarily suspended their usual dynamics.
When the music finally ended and applause filled the space, they were joined by their colleagues, who appeared energized and slightly deaf.
"You missed the best part! The final movement was incredible," Kim exclaimed.
"Absolutely devastating. I'll never forgive myself," Jay replied with exaggerated sorrow.
"The regret will haunt me forever," Ian said, adopting a similarly theatrical expression.
Their mock despair sent Ela into fits of laughter, while Luc shook his head in disappointment. Leo, Jay noticed, was watching the exchange with a distinctly pleased expression.
"We're going to try to meet the artist. Kim and Ela want to discuss the technical aspects of the sound design," Luc's girlfriend announced.
"Count me in," Leo said, offering his arm to his companion.
As the group migrated toward the backstage area, Ian caught Leo's theatrical wink and rolled his eyes.
"Those two seem to have plans," Jay observed.
"Leo always has plans. Most of them involve other people's business," Ian replied.
Max and Amy excused themselves shortly after, declaring the evening "definitely an experience" with the diplomatic tone of people who'd fulfilled a social obligation.
"I think we've done our cultural duty. Amy's husband is picking us up in ten minutes," Max announced.
"Thank you for including me. Even if I didn't entirely understand what we just witnessed," Amy added.
Ian and Jay were alone again, slowly making their way toward the exit. The warm evening air felt like a blessing after hours in the stuffy basement.
"My driver is waiting around the corner. Can I give you a lift home?" Ian said.
Jay hesitated, but his usual reservations about imposing on Ian's politeness felt less pressing after their shared evening of cultural suffering. "That would be great, thank you."
The car ride was short—downtown traffic was minimal at this hour—but they managed to continue their discussion of whether artistic merit was inversely proportional to audience comprehension.
"So what's the verdict on avant-garde music?" Ian asked as they arrived at Jay's building.
"I think I'll stick to whatever's on the radio. Though I suppose it was educational."
"Educational is a diplomatic way to put it."
"Thank you for the ride. And for the company. The evening was much more tolerable with a fellow philistine."
"Anytime. Though next time, perhaps we could find an event that serves better whiskey."
Jay watched the car disappear into the night before heading upstairs to his apartment. The evening had been a disaster from a cultural perspective, but Ian's unexpected companionship had turned it into something almost enjoyable. There was something reassuring about discovering that his usually composed boss was just as bewildered by experimental music as he was.
As he prepared for bed, Jay thought that even the most challenging experiences seemed manageable with the right company.
## Scene 5
Early June
The office reverberated with the aftermath of the concert for days afterward, though opinions remained sharply divided. Luc and Kim had formed an unexpected alliance, bonding over their shared marvel at what they'd witnessed and discussing nothing but experimental electronic music during every break.
"The way they manipulated the spatial acoustics was revolutionary," Kim explained to anyone within earshot.
"Exactly!" Luc agreed. "And the visual integration with the sound design created this completely immersive experience."
Max rolled his eyes whenever their conversations drifted in this direction. "Young people and their incomprehensible aesthetic preferences," he muttered to Amy during one particularly lengthy discussion about post-industrial soundscapes.
Jay agreed with Max's assessment, though he kept his opinions to himself. The concert had been memorable, but not for the reasons Luc and Kim seemed to think.
As May gave way to June, the weather changed from pleasantly warm to oppressively hot. The city sweltered under an intense heat wave, and Jay quickly discovered that his studio apartment's aging air conditioning unit was no match for the soaring temperatures. By contrast, the Turner & Associates offices maintained perfect climate control, making them infinitely more comfortable than anywhere else he could think of.
"I'll be staying late tonight," he mentioned to Ian on a particularly brutal Monday. "My apartment's basically uninhabitable until the sun goes down."
Ian accepted this explanation without question, probably because the heat was truly unbearable. The city's infrastructure seemed to be struggling under the extreme temperatures, with rolling blackouts affecting older buildings and the metro system running on reduced schedules.
Jay's late work days became more frequent, though the extended hours weren't really justified by increased workload. He simply found the office more pleasant than his overheated studio.
Ian, predictably, was always there during these late afternoons. His long hours weren't situational, they were routine. He rarely left before eight, often working well into the evening. Jay began to feel complicated emotions about this pattern, something that moved increasingly into the territory of worry as the days passed. 
"Don't you ever take breaks?" Jay asked one evening as they worked in the quiet office, the rest of the building mostly empty.
Ian looked up from his laptop, seeming puzzled by the question. "I take lunch breaks every day."
"For twenty minutes. That doesn't count."
"It's thirty minutes."
Jay let it drop, but the concern lingered.
Their time together in the mostly empty building felt more relaxed than their usual interactions, as if the circumstances had dissolved some invisible barrier between them.
"Any progress on those summaries?" Ian would ask.
"Almost finished. The heat makes it hard to concentrate."
"I can imagine. Take your time."
These conversations were brief but comfortable, both of them seeming to appreciate the other's company without feeling obligated to fill every silence with discussion.
Jay maintained his gym routine despite the weather, though he adjusted his schedule to accommodate the temperature. Tuesdays remained sacred, spent under Rus's patient guidance in the mercifully air-conditioned facility.
"You're getting stronger," Rus observed during a particularly challenging session. "Not dramatically, but consistently. Your form is much better."
"I don't really see much difference."
"Progress isn't always visible immediately. But your endurance has improved, and your posture is better throughout the day."
Jay felt pleased by the assessment. Physical fitness had never been a priority, but the gradual improvements were encouraging. He was even considering taking up Zoe's offer to try diving lessons, though he hadn't mentioned that possibility to anyone yet.
The weather also prompted another wardrobe overhaul. Jay's dark wool suits were torture in the current temperatures, forcing him to invest in lighter alternatives. He'd finally bit the bullet and purchased lighter options in muted beige and light gray.
While shopping, he also made another significant purchase, a second formal evening suit for upcoming company functions. He'd worn the same outfit to every elegant event since starting at Turner & Associates, and the prospect of arriving at July's quarterly party in identical attire felt embarrassing.
His closet had undergone yet another complete transformation. Gone were almost all of his old jeans and sweatshirts, replaced by an increasingly sophisticated collection of suits and dress shirts. He was running out of space, having to arrange things carefully to fit everything properly.
The apartment's limitations were becoming more apparent with each passing day. Jay had calculated his financial situation after nearly a year at Turner & Associates and realized he was in a position to consider a significant upgrade. He could afford a down payment on a one-bedroom apartment, and the monthly mortgage payments would be similar to his current rent.
He'd started browsing listings during his late afternoon hours in the office, looking for places in quiet neighbourhoods slightly closer to the financial district. It wasn't urgent, but the idea of having proper closet space and reliable air conditioning was increasingly appealing.
"Looking at real estate?" Ian asked one evening, noticing Jay's computer screen as he passed by.
"Just browsing. My current place is getting a bit cramped."
Ian paused, glancing at the listings Jay had pulled up. "Those are good neighborhoods. Safe, convenient to the office."
"That's what I was thinking. Though I'm not in any particular hurry."
"Take your time with it. Buying property is a big decision."
Jay appreciated the advice, even though he suspected Ian spoke from experience Jay couldn't begin to imagine. The price ranges Ian probably considered were likely several times what Jay was contemplating.
Meanwhile, his upcoming trip home required preparation of a different sort. Jay had submitted the paperwork for borrowing a company car, though the prospect of driving four hours on unfamiliar highways made him nervous enough to book driving lessons.
"I need to brush up on my skills," he explained to the driving instructor "It's been a while, and I have an important trip coming up."
After three sessions, Jay felt more at ease. Highway driving wasn't as intimidating as he'd remembered, and the instructor was patient with her cautious approach to highway merging and parallel parking.
"You're actually a competent driver," she assured him. "You just need to trust your instincts more. The fundamentals are solid."
The heat continued unabated, making the office's climate control feel increasingly precious. Jay's extended work days became an established pattern, and being alone with Ian during these evening hours felt natural. They'd developed a rhythm of parallel productivity, each focused on their respective tasks but comfortable sharing the space.
It was a small thing, but it represented how much had changed since Jay's anxious first days at Turner & Associates. He no longer felt like an intruder in Ian's domain, and Ian no longer seemed to view him as a potential threat to be monitored.
