# Chapter 9: New Year

## Scene 1: After the holidays

The office felt different after the holidays, with most of the desks empty and the usual bustle absent. Jay arrived earlier than necessary, energized and eager.

"Good morning," Jay said as he passed Ian's office, surprised that his boss was already at his desk.

Ian looked up from his computer. "Good morning, Jay. I trust you had a pleasant holiday?"

"Very pleasant, thank you. Quiet and restful." Jay hesitated in the doorway. "How was your Christmas?"

"Productive." Ian's tone offered no invitation for further inquiry. "I've prepared a list of priority items for this week. With our reduced staff, we'll need to focus on essential tasks."

"Of course. I'm ready."

Jay sat at his desk with renewed purpose. The break had done him good. He felt clear-headed, approaching each task with focus.

Only a skeleton crew remained during the week between Christmas and New Year's, and even that had been reduced when Ela called in sick with the flu that morning, her voice hoarse and apologetic over the phone.

"Don't worry about it," Ian had told her. "Rest and recover properly. We'll manage."

Luc arrived an hour later, looking considerably less energetic. "This place is like a ghost town."

"Ela called in sick this morning—caught the flu." Jay replied.

"So it's just the three of us? This should be interesting."

The morning passed smoothly despite their reduced numbers. Jay worked through client correspondence while Ian handled the more complex enquiries.

Luc emerged from the open space looking slightly overwhelmed. "Thank God you're both here. I've got three client reports that need to be finished by Friday, and Ela was supposed to handle most of them."

"I can take on the market analysis," Jay offered immediately. "I've been studying the proper formats."

Ian watched Jay's eager expression and felt a tightness in his chest. The young man's recovery was remarkable—he'd regained that bright, determined look that had initially caught Ian's attention. But Ian's own reaction to that enthusiasm now felt dangerous.

"That would be great," Ian said. "I'll review the parameters with you."

Jay worked diligently, asking questions and tackling complex data into clear reports. Ian fought the urge to watch him too closely.

Every instinct screamed at Ian to maintain distance. The dream from the night before had left him wary, hyperaware of every casual interaction. But he also recognized that Jay's confidence remained fragile despite his improved mood. One careless gesture could undo months of progress. So Ian forced himself to be patient and accommodating, answering Jay's questions thoroughly. The effort was exhausting—like walking a tightrope while pretending everything was normal.

By lunchtime, it became clear that the workload would be manageable but demanding. Jay volunteered to take on additional responsibilities, preparing reports that would typically be distributed among the full team.

By late afternoon, Luc had finished his assignments and was preparing to leave. "I'm heading out," he announced, gathering his things. "My girlfriend's cooking dinner, and I don't want to be late."

"Have a good evening," Ian replied, not looking up from his computer.

"Don't work too hard, you two. The world won't end if something waits until tomorrow."

As Luc's footsteps faded down the corridor, Jay glanced at the remaining work on his desk. His analysis was nearly complete, but Ian still had several client summaries to review.

"I can stay late and help with those," Jay said, gesturing toward Ian's stack of documents. "It's not like I have anywhere else to be."

"That's not necessary," Ian replied quickly. "I can manage it."

"Please, let me help. I want to contribute."

Ian looked at Jay's earnest expression and felt his resolve waver. He could see the importance this held for Jay—the chance to prove himself useful, to be trusted with meaningful work. Refusing would likely hurt Jay's feelings.

"All right," Ian said finally.

The next few hours passed quickly. They worked in silence, Jay at his desk while Ian remained in his office. The building grew quieter as everyone else left and the cleaning crew finished their rounds.

Jay had stayed late before, but almost always with other people present. The current situation felt different—since no one else was there, it felt more intimate. The warm glow of the Christmas lights in the corridor cast everything in a softer light.

Jay worked through a stack of client summaries, but he couldn't shake the awareness of Ian across the room. They were alone together like never before—no colleagues nearby, no interruptions from the office activity.

"Jay." Ian's voice made him look up. "Could you review these projections? I want to ensure the calculations are accurate before I submit them."

Jay accepted the documents, their fingers brushing briefly as the papers changed hands. The contact lasted only a moment, but Jay felt his skin burn at the touch.

"Of course," he said, hoping his voice sounded steadier than he felt.

As Jay worked through the projections, he was acutely aware of Ian returning to his desk, the sound of his chair, the rustle of papers being organized. The office felt simultaneously vast and cramped, as if they were occupying a private space carved out from the larger corporate world.

Jay discovered something unexpected as the evening progressed: he trusted Ian. Not just as a supervisor, but as a man. The realization struck him as he worked through the data—he felt entirely safe with Ian, protected by his integrity.

Under normal circumstances, being alone in an office with a senior manager would have made him anxious. His previous experience had taught him to be wary of men in positions of power, to expect the worst from such situations. But with Ian, that fear simply didn't exist. Jay couldn't explain the certainty he felt about Ian's character—they didn't know each other well, they had shared few personal conversations. Yet Jay trusted him implicitly.

The trust was absolute and unquestioning, a feeling Jay hadn't experienced with anyone in years. Ian could ask him to do anything, and Jay would comply without hesitation, confident that the request would be reasonable and appropriate.

This certainty should have been comforting, but instead it made Jay's pulse quicken. He trusted Ian not to take advantage, not to make him uncomfortable, not to use his position inappropriately. It was a level of faith Jay hadn't experienced since starting his career. But the intimacy of the moment also made his skin tingle. The quiet office, the warm lighting, the sense of being alone together—it created an atmosphere that felt charged, even though Jay knew nothing would happen.

Jay forced himself to focus on the documents, but his awareness of Ian remained constant. Through the windows, the city lights twinkled like earthbound stars, and Jay felt as though they were suspended in a moment outside of normal time.

He glanced up to find Ian watching him with an unreadable expression. For a heartbeat, neither man looked away, then Ian returned to his work, and Jay did the same. But the air in the office vibrated with tension that Jay couldn't identify.

## Scene 2: Before New Year

As the week progressed, Jay threw himself into his work with determination, driven by a desire to make Ian's workload as manageable as possible. After nearly five months at Turner & Associates, he'd developed some expertise in the company's basic operations and client needs.

His evenings at home had been spent studying client portfolios and industry standards, and the investment was paying off. Jay could now manage simple reports and handle standard client correspondence with minimal supervision. He was reserving only the most crucial assignments for Ian.

"You're a godsend," Luc said on Wednesday morning, watching Jay organize the day's priorities. "Without you, I'd probably be sleeping in the office."

Ian observed Jay's initiative, not just in organization but in the matters that drove their business. His reports were clear and his instincts increasingly sound.

Jay stayed late every evening, working through tasks that would have otherwise fallen to Ian. One evening, as the office began to empty out, Ian paused by Jay's desk.

"It's the holiday season, Jay. You should head home and get some rest."

"When I get home, I study the work materials anyway," Jay said, not looking up from his computer. "It doesn't matter to me if I'm in the office a bit longer."

Ian shook his head in resignation. He recognized the pattern—the complete absorption in work that left no room for personal life. He didn't want Jay to become like him, a monk married to the job, but he was hardly in a position to criticize.

The lunch routine changed organically. With most of the team gone, Jay and Luc abandoned the group outings to restaurants. The weather was brutal, and neither felt motivated to venture outside for extended periods.

"I grabbed sandwiches from that bakery nearby," Jay announced, holding up a paper bag. "Turkey club and roast beef. Take your pick."

"Lifesaver," Luc replied, accepting the turkey club. "I was dreading another frozen walk to find food."

They ate in the office kitchen, a space Jay had rarely used for eating before. Ian appeared at his usual lunch hour, retrieving a container from the refrigerator and heating it in the microwave.

"Mind if I join you?" Ian asked, though he was already sitting down at the small table.

"Of course," Jay said, but he felt suddenly self-conscious about his lunch.

The conversation was stilted at first. Ian was private even during breaks, never discussing personal matters or revealing much about his life outside the office. But Jay enjoyed seeing this different side of his boss—less formal, more human.

"What does Ian eat?" Jay asked on Luc, realizing he'd never paid attention to his boss's meal habits.

"Ian has a personal meal service. Everything prepared according to optimal macros and delivered fresh."

Jay looked up, surprised. "Seriously? I thought he just skipped meals."

Luc laughed. "Does he look like someone who skips meals? He's a gym rat. Working out is basically the only thing he does besides work. Very disciplined about it."

Jay took in the information with interest. He'd never thought about Ian's life outside the office, but now he watchem him more carefully. It was entirely possible that he was actually quite muscular beneath those tailored clothes. The broad shoulders, the way he held himself—it all supported Luc's observation.

Jay also identified the sleek containers in the office refrigerator. Each meal was portioned exactly, the contents clearly optimized for nutrition.

As New Year's Eve approached, the three of them worked closer than ever. Several last-minute client emergencies tested their coordination, but they handled each situation smoothly. Jay felt his confidence soaring with each successful resolution.

The work was meaningful, bringing him satisfaction unlike anything he'd experienced before. He began to understand why some people became workaholics—there was something deeply fulfilling about performing duties to the highest standard and seeing tangible results.

Jay looked toward Ian's office and felt a new understanding of his boss. Perhaps Ian felt this same fulfillment, this sense of purpose that made long hours feel worthwhile.

The last day before New Year was notably calmer. Client correspondence had slowed to a trickle, and their major assignments were complete. The entire financial district switched into celebratory mode.

Around four o'clock, Ian surprised both Jay and Luc by appearing at their desks.

"Would you join me in my office?"

They followed him, exchanging curious glances. Ian moved to the credenza where he kept a selection of glasses and a bottle of whiskey Jay had never noticed before.

"I thought we should toast the year," Ian said, pouring three generous measures. "It's been particularly successful."

Luc accepted his glass eagerly, but Jay hesitated. "I'm not sure this is entirely appropriate—"

Ian laughed, a sound that softened his entire demeanor. "We're done with our work, and we'll all be leaving momentarily. Even I won't stay late today. If it were truly improper, I wouldn't keep alcohol and glasses in my office in the first place."

Jay accepted his glass, still uncertain but charmed by Ian's unexpected warmth. He had never seen Ian laugh this way—not the polite smile, but genuine joy. He had a feeling this moment would stay with him for a long time.

"To a successful year," Ian said, raising his glass.

"To surviving the holidays," Luc added with a grin.

They drank, and Luc immediately looked impressed. "This is excellent whiskey."

"It's actually my best bottle," Ian admitted.

Luc went pale. "How best are we talking?"

"Best enough that you should savor it, not gulp it."

Jay sipped his whiskey and immediately made a face. "I never understood hard liquor."

Both men laughed at his expression, and Jay felt a warm thread of connection despite his distaste for the drink. He persevered, drinking stubbornly while continuing to grimace.

"It's an acquired taste," Ian said. "Wine is more forgiving for beginners."

"What do you usually drink?" Jay asked, emboldened by the alcohol and the relaxed atmosphere.

"Scotch, mostly. Sometimes bourbon. I prefer aged spirits—they have more complexity."

Ian explained the differences between various whiskeys, his passion for the subject evident in his detailed descriptions. Jay listened intently, fascinated by this glimpse into Ian's personal preferences.

The conversation continued for another twenty minutes, all three men feeling closer after the intense week they'd shared. Even Ian was more at ease, the initial tension from his dream having subsided. He'd regained confidence in his ability to compartmentalize his attraction.

Jay radiated happiness. The innocence in his expression touched something in Ian's chest, a warmth he didn't dare examine too closely.

When their drinks were finished, Ian got up, offering a brief farewell. "Happy New Year, Jay," Ian said, extending his hand. "Thank you for everything this week."

Jay shook his hand, looking a little embarrassed. "Happy New Year, Ian. I'm glad I could be useful."

Jay left the office that evening feeling fulfilled and secure. Despite everything, this had been a good year. Challenging and not free from drama, but ultimately strengthening.

He felt truly blessed, and even his initial anger at Leo had faded. The man's meddling had actually resulted in something wonderful.

On impulse, Jay sent a message to Leo's company phone: "Happy New Year. You are forgiven."

Across town at an upscale party, Leo read the message and grinned. Combined with Ian's recent tennis-related tantrum, things were clearly progressing in the right direction.

Jay spent New Year's Eve alone in his apartment, watching fireworks bloom across the city skyline at midnight. He felt good—genuinely, deeply good.

In his own apartment, Ian stood at his window watching the same fireworks. He felt a similar contentment, a sense that the year had brought positive change.

Both men thought about each other as the new year began, and for once, these thoughts were warm and hopeful, not complicated by doubt or fear.

## Scene 3: Bonus

The first week of January brought Turner & Associates back to life at full throttle, the year-start chaos intensified by the dual demands of annual and quarterly reports. Ela was still home recovering from the flu, Kim was on vacation for another week, and the smaller team meant no one had time to ease into the new year. Jay arrived earlier than usual on his first day back, only to find Ian already in his office with the door ajar, a half-empty coffee cup beside him and several files open on his desk.

"Good morning," Jay said as he passed.

Ian glanced up from a document. "Good morning. I trust you had a good holiday?"

"I did, thank you. I hope yours was restful."

"It was," Ian replied, before turning back to his work.

Jay's tasks felt comfortable now, second nature after months of practice. At eleven-thirty, his computer chimed with a new email. The subject line read: "Year-End Performance and Bonus Announcement." Jay opened it immediately.

The email explained the record-breaking year and announced that bonuses had been processed. Jay checked his phone for bank notifications. Nothing yet. He wondered what constituted a bonus at a firm like Turner & Associates.

Around noon, the notification finally arrived.

Jay stared at the screen, dumb founded. Eighty thousand. The number couldn't be right. He counted the digits again: five digits. More money than he'd ever seen in his account at once.

He walked quickly to Luc's desk. "Luc, could I ask you something?"

Luc looked up, grinning. "Let me guess. You got your bonus notification and think there's been a mistake."

"Well... yes. There has to be an error."

"No error. Welcome to the real benefits of working in big finance. When the year is good, the bonus is mind-blowing. And this year was spectacular."

Jay looked around the office. Max was discussing vacation plans. Amy looked pleased. The reality was sinking in.

Jay felt a warm flush of pride. "It still feels unreal."

"Enjoy it," Luc said. "You've been working hard. You deserve to celebrate."

Jay researched tailors and decided to upgrade his wardrobe. Three new suits, properly tailored, would help him feel more confident. After work, he visited a boutique that specialized in business attire.

The fittings went smoothly, and Jay felt good about the investment. The new year had begun with unexpected generosity, and Jay was determined to make the most of it.

## Scene 4: Friday evening reflections

The days that followed were relentless. New projects launched alongside the backlog from the break, and with both the quarterly and annual reports due, there was little room to breathe. Eventually Ela returned from her sick leave and Kim came back from vacation. The office felt complete again.

By the end of the week, the quarterly reports were finished. The pace eased marginally. Monday brought the return of the team's lunch outings.

Friday afternoon brought a sense of completion. Jay finished organizing Ian's calendar and compiled the status reports. The office gradually emptied.

"Hey Jay," Luc said, stopping by his desk. "Feel like grabbing drinks?"

Jay looked up from his computer. "Thanks, but I'll pass."

"Come on, it's Friday. Live a little."

Jay decided to be honest. "Pubs overwhelm me, to be completely frank. I'd rather avoid them if possible."

Luc grinned. "Fair enough. We'll ease you into it gradually."

After Luc left, Jay finished his remaining tasks. The office felt peaceful in the early evening light. Since the team had returned to full strength, Jay no longer needed to stay late every day.

Back at his apartment, Jay hung up his coat and surveyed the space. He made dinner and ate while reviewing the day's events.

As evening deepened, Jay got restless. He cleaned up and finally dismantled the Christmas tree, packing away the ornaments. He sat by the window with tea, watching the city lights.

Jay wondered if Ian was still at the office. The thought of Ian working alone stirred something sympathetic in his chest.

Jay considered gym memberships, curious about activities that brought Ian fulfillment. He researched fitness centres and bookmarked several options.

The evening stretched ahead. Jay accepted the unusual restlessness as part of his continuing evolution.

## Scene 5: Preparations

The week before the gala, Jay made his rounds to collect the various elements of his formal ensemble. The tailor greeted him politely.

"Perfect fit," the man said as Jay examined himself in the fitting room mirror.

Jay turned slowly. The tuxedo looked good on him. He looked like he might belong at the Grand Hotel.

Walking back to his apartment, Jay realized he needed to address another detail: his hair. Finding a hairdresser proved challenging—January was peak season for formal events.

Finally, a salon in the upscale shopping district had an opening. Jay accepted despite the high price.

Thursday afternoon, Jay collected his new suits. Each piece fit impeccably. He thanked the tailor and headed to the department store to complete his wardrobe upgrade.

Returning home, Jay faced an unexpected problem. His closet was overwhelmed by his expanded wardrobe. The old clothes would have to go.

The reorganized closet looked dramatically different. These expensive clothes seemed to belong in a larger space.

Jay thought about other aspects of his appearance but decided against cologne—better to smell neutral than risk olfactory offence.

Jay stepped back and surveyed his apartment. He could afford something larger now, but dismissed the idea. His current apartment felt secure and manageable.

Jay sat on the sofa, pleased with his preparations. He felt ready to represent Turner & Associates with dignity.
