Chapter 34: Damp weather
Scene 1
Warming soup
Team members took turns taking time off to recuperate before the next busy periods. The office was missing one or two people constantly. Jay expressed no desire to join them. Strategy season hadn't been nearly as bad for him as for the others, despite his mishap with the database. He'd survived. They needed the rest more.
Ian continued working twelve-hour days, but he returned to normal, his face recovering its glow. The dark circles faded. The tension in his shoulders eased. Jay watched it with relief.
March was ending, but the weather remained poor. Rain battered the windows most mornings, and the sky hung gray and heavy through the afternoons. However, with the immediate crisis temporarily resolved, the team returned to their daily lunch outings. Weather grumbling was constant but less pronounced. Everyone was glad to leave the office.
"It's supposed to rain until April," Kim announced Monday afternoon, scrolling through his phone.
"Fantastic. I love perpetual dampness," Ela muttered.
"We could eat at our desks," Amy said without enthusiasm.
"Absolutely not. We earned our lunches out. Weather be damned," Luc said firmly.
Jay used the first opportunity that presented itself to push for his favourite. "What about Willow & Sage?"
"That little place with the soup?" Zoe asked.
"Yes. I haven't been there in months."
"Tragic existence," Luc joked.
"Then Willow & Sage it is," Amy decided.
They went that afternoon, crowding through the door and shaking rain from their coats. The warm, cosy atmosphere immediately lifted Jay's spirits. Rough wooden tables, soft lighting, herbs hanging in bunches from exposed beams. The smell of bread and simmering stock. He'd missed this place.
They sat at a long table near the back. Jay ordered warming soup with herbal bread. The exact meal he'd been craving for weeks.
He hunched in the corner with Zoe and Luc, listening to Zoe describe her weekend hiking trip with good-natured enthusiasm. Luc looked better than he had in weeks, colour returned to his face, energy restored.
"It was a great success despite the miserable weather. Being able to finally walk around instead of constantly sitting at a desk was brilliant," Zoe said.
The food arrived. Jay took his first spoonful of soup and closed his eyes briefly. Perfect. Rich and earthy with just enough salt.
"You look like you're having a religious experience," Luc observed.
"Maybe I am."
Luc watched him for another moment, then set down his fork. "So what was bothering you so much lately?"
The table went quiet. Jay opened his eyes.
"We were the ones living in the office. But you were the one who looked like you were being actively tortured."
Jay grew quiet. He tore off a piece of bread, focusing on it. "Personal matters."
"Personal matters," Kim repeated with great cheerfulness. "Are you sure it wasn't still the dropped table matter? Because that was honestly hilarious. The look on your face when you realized—"
"It wasn't that. And I don't want to talk about it. But I appreciate your concern, even if you're terribly insensitive about it."
Kim grinned. "Fair."
"We're not trying to pry," Amy said more gently. "You just seemed… different. For a while."
"I'm fine now," Jay said. "Really."
"If you're sure."
"I'm sure."
The conversation moved on. Jay focused on his soup, letting the warmth seep through him. The bread was dense and fragrant with rosemary. Each bite pushed back the unpleasant memories of the lost envelope, the months of saving gone in a moment of carelessness. He definitely didn't want to publicly admit to that blunder. Some failures were too mortifying to share.
By the time they returned to the office, the rain had intensified into a proper downpour. They arrived soaked, dripping puddles onto the marble floor.
Jay returned to his desk and opened his email. Another message from HR about the May retreat. He accepted the invite and clicked through to the signup sheet.
The activity list was extensive. Horseback riding. Archery. Pottery. Dancing. Kayaking. Cooking classes. Hiking trails. Paddle boats.
Nothing as adventurous as horseback archery, but the hike seemed comfortable enough. He selected it. Cooking classes could be interesting. He added those as well. Paddle boats sounded fun. He picked that too.
He was scrolling through the remaining options when Ian emerged from his office. He approached Jay's desk, glancing at the screen.
"Did you choose the boats?" Ian asked.
Jay looked up. "Yes. Just now."
"I'm quite fond of those."
"Can we be on the same boat then?"
"Naturally. I'll make arrangements."
"Thank you."
Though Ian thought to himself he probably wouldn't need to. Leo would make sure they got grouped in everything.
Ian returned to his office. Jay turned back to his screen, excitement building. Spending time doing fun things with Ian again. Just a couple of weeks ago he'd given up on this life entirely. Now he had something to look forward to.
He scrolled through the signup sheet one more time, confirming his selections. He could imagine Ian on the boat, hair catching the wind. Or hiking together through the woods. Cooking side by side in the lodge kitchen like they had at Christmas.
Jay agreed with Kim that separate room were a downgrade. The morning coffee with Ian while they were both still in their respective beds was the best. He caught himself at this thought and blushed furiously. What was he even thinking? Fay's diagnosis echoed in his mind: head over heels in love.
Preposterous. He just wanted to hang out with someone he admired. That was a perfectly normal friendly wish. Nothing more complicated than that.
He closed the signup form and returned to his spreadsheets, determinedly ignoring the way his pulse had quickened at the thought of sharing a boat with Ian. Just friends. Colleagues. Nothing strange about looking forward to activities with a person you respected.
The rain continued outside. Jay worked through the afternoon, occasionally glancing toward Ian's office with fondness. Completely nothing weird about that at all.
Scene 2
Submitting the paperwork
As April loomed, Jay wanted to get as many affairs in order before the next hectic period. He arranged the bank visit to sign the loan paperwork.
The bank accommodated his preferred time on Friday afternoon. Since he'd already provided all the details in the pre-approval stage, he just went to officially submit his application.
The bank lady was as helpful and friendly as the last time, giving him obviously preferential treatment. She helped him expediently with the paperwork. He had all the necessary documents ready, including property valuation conveniently delivered by the real estate agent.
"Excellent. The paperwork will be ready to sign in two weeks. Once you do, the money will be transferred within a couple of days," she said as she gathered the papers into a neat stack.
"Two weeks. So early April."
"Exactly. We'll call when everything is ready."
"Thank you."
The whole process took less than twenty minutes. Jay left the bank with feeling dizzy. It was really happening. He called the real estate agent from the street.
"Mr. Hall," the agent answered cheerfully. "How did it go?"
"Everything's submitted. They said two weeks for the paperwork, then a couple of days for the transfer."
"Perfect, perfect. I'll handle the notary work. Just let me know when the funds are confirmed, and we'll schedule the final signing."
"I will. Thank you."
"It's a beautiful property. You're making an excellent choice."
Jay ended the call and stood on the sidewalk for a moment. It was final then. In about three weeks, he'd move. Right in the middle of April, after Easter.
He hadn't canceled his lease yet. He had a three-month termination period, but wanted to be secure in the new place before he felt comfortable abandoning his current flat. And despite how gloomy it looked stacked with boxes, he was still very fond of it. Leaving still saddened him.
That evening, he called his mother.
"Jay?" She sounded surprised. "Is everything alright?"
"Everything's fine. I wanted to ask about Easter. Do you have plans?"
"Plans? No, we'll stay at home. Traditional dinner. Why?"
"I was thinking I could visit."
"Visit?" Her voice lifted with joy. "Really? Oh, that would be wonderful!"
In the background, Jay heard his youngest brother Ari's voice: "Is that Jay? Is he bringing gifts?"
Jay heard his mother's muffled response, then Ari yelled louder: "We'll send a wishlist!"
His mother laughed. "You heard."
"All you care about is gifts," Jay grumbled, but he wasn't really annoyed.
"They're young," his mother said warmly. "They miss you. We all do."
"I miss you too."
"Will you stay overnight?"
"I'd like that. I'll arrive on Saturday and leave Sunday afternoon. It's a long drive, after all."
"Of course, of course. I'm so happy you're coming."
Ari yelled something else in the background about chocolate.
"I'll bring something," Jay promised.
After they hung up, Jay felt lighter. It had been too long since he'd visited home. Work had consumed everything for months, but now that things had stabilized, he could finally take the trip.
He used the weekend to handle the shopping. On Saturday he went to a large grocery store, working through his mental list. Variety of sweets first—chocolate eggs, marshmallow candies, fruit jellies. He moved on to food. Since he was going to visit, he wanted to help cook. He filled his cart with groceries that had long shelf life. Olive oil. Hard cheese. Cured meats. Aged sausages. Variety of pastas. Canned vegetables. Things that could lay around for two weeks in his pantry without spoiling.
Then items from his siblings' texted wish list, which had arrived within an hour of his call. Then he tackled clothing. His storage problems were about to be mostly solved, so he could finally get some casual clothes. He went to one of the nice boutiques that had been recommended to him last year.
The shop was quiet when he entered. A young clerk approached immediately.
"Good afternoon. Can I help you find something?"
"I need casual jeans and shirts," Jay said.
"Of course. What's your size?"
Jay told him. The clerk nodded and began pulling items from displays and racks.
"Try these. And these shirts should work well. The colours suit you."
Jay took them to the fitting room. He was pleased to discover that shopping for clothes was no longer an excruciating ordeal. It was hardly pleasant, but definitely manageable. Last year he'd needed to prepare beforehand and write himself an itinerary. Now he at least simply entered the store and picked things that were most acceptable.
Ian's advice echoed in his mind: Find an expert, and do what they say.
He tried on the jeans first. The fit was good. The shirts were comfortable, soft cotton in muted colours. Blue, gray, dark green.
"How's everything?" the clerk called.
"Good. I'll take these."
He emerged from the fitting room with his selections. The clerk rang them up efficiently.
"Anything else you need?" he asked.
"No, this is fine. Thank you."
"Have a good day."
Jay left with his purchases, feeling accomplished. Tasks handled. Plans in motion. Everything falling into place.
He went to work on Monday in an uncommonly good mood—something rare for him lately. Ian was already there and looked up when Jay arrived.
"Good morning," Ian said.
"Good morning."
"You seem in better spirits."
"I am. I'm moving forward with the apartment and the mortgage. I'll probably move within a month. Now that the decision is final and the paperwork is submitted, I feel calmer about it. I'm no longer stressing about making the right choice."
"That's excellent news."
"And I'm visiting my family for Easter."
"That sounds nice."
"It's been too long. My youngest brother already demanded gifts."
"How old is he?"
"Thirteen. Still thinks I'm made of money."
"Younger siblings often do. You look much better than you used to in the past month."
Jay laughed. "The strategy season was hard on everyone, me included, even if I didn't have as much stake in it."
"I'll make sure it's easier next year. There are some promising candidates lined up. Leo actually put in the work on high-stakes headhunting. Their salaries are going to hurt, but it's better than having the whole team burn out and quit."
Jay returned to his desk, organizing his workspace for the day. April was going to be busy, but he felt ready for it.
Scene 3
Intentions
March ended and the hectic period of quarterly reporting began. The entire team returned to work to deal with the workload, the brief vacation period ending abruptly.
But before Jay could fully immerse himself in the work, a bank notification arrived with his salary. He opened it at his desk, expecting it to be higher, given the quarterly bonus, the strategy bonus, his new pay rise. But the number started him. Eighty thousand.
Four times his normal salary.
He stared at the screen, refreshing it twice to confirm. The number didn't change.
This time he went to accounting to confirm. He was comfortable enough with them now to simply ask. The accounting department occupied a corner on their floor, separated by frosted glass doors.
Jen looked up when he entered, her face brightening immediately. "Jay! What can I do for you?"
"I think there might be an error with my salary."
"An error? What's the issue?"
"It's… higher than expected."
She typed rapidly, scanning the screen. Then she smiled. "No error. Your new contract came into effect at the beginning of the year, so you received compensation for the difference."
"The difference," Jay repeated.
"Right. Your quarterly bonus is also based on your new salary, not the old one. That, plus the additional strategy bonus, gives you the result you saw."
"So it's correct."
"Completely correct. You look surprised."
"I am."
"You earned it." She turned back to her screen but kept talking. "So how have you been? It feels like forever since we've chatted. You're always so busy—"
"I should get back to work. The quarterly reports."
"Oh, of course. But we should grab coffee sometime—"
"Maybe. Thank you for clarifying."
He retreated quickly, returning to his desk. He looked at his balance once again on his phone. He was being paid obscenely well. It shouldn't shock him anymore, but it still did.
But the musings about money would have to wait. He returned to his assignments, opening the first file on his list.
The team braved the workload better this time. The processes concerning Hartwell, their newest and most demanding client, had been streamlined and weren't causing as many problems as previous seasons. The workload was still heavy, but nothing compared to what had happened in the past months.
Tuesday evening, Luc shut his laptop at ten o'clock and stood triumphantly.
"At least I don't need to camp out in the office," he chanted, grabbing his coat. "At least I don't need to camp out in the office."
"We're coming back Saturday," Kim pointed out.
"Still counts as going home."
Lunches got replaced with takeout again. Working until ten every evening became the norm. But the weather outside was still miserable, rain and gray skies constant, so staying in felt less like a punishment. And at least everyone could return home, even if they had to come in Saturday.
Jay already dreaded his next gym visit. Rus would definitely scold him for his job being unreasonable and for making a mistake by staying.
But Jay's mood was much better. He'd almost forgotten about the misery of his February blunders. Time and intense periods that followed took his mind off things. The increased workload didn't bother him. He was even glad for it.
Since the office was always busy recently—first with absences of people taking vacation days, requiring longer hours from the rest, now with everyone working hard on quarterly reports—he didn't have as much time to stay alone with Ian.
It wasn't that he didn't want to be in Ian's company. Quite the opposite. He appreciated and treasured it. But Fay's words about being in love kept randomly reappearing and making him flustered. It was ridiculous, naturally, but the idea didn't want to retire from his mind and kept popping up at random moments.
He didn't feel ready to spend prolonged time alone with Ian. What if he suddenly started blushing for no reason? That would just make everything unnecessarily awkward.
Wednesday afternoon, Ian emerged from his office to refill his coffee. Jay was at his desk, absorbed in a spreadsheet, one hand in his hair, the other clicking through cells.
Ian watched for a moment, then returned to his office without speaking. Better not to interrupt.
Ian had his own reservations. He was still beating himself up over his blunder of calling Jay beautiful. It was around that time that Jay started to withdraw. He was sure it was at least part of the reason.
Jay valued his peace and security above all. If he felt in any way threatened, he'd flee. Everything was going so well, and Ian had to ruin it by making Jay doubt his intentions.
His intentions were absolutely pure. Regardless of what he thought and felt about Jay, he would never make him uncomfortable. He would rather die than violate the trust they'd built. Jay needed to be absolutely certain of it.
But since Jay was still here, still showed care openly, the damage wasn't too serious. Ian could still rebuild what they had. Make Jay feel safe enough again for them to share those tender moments, just like they used to. He just needed to make sure to never make any more stupid mistakes.
He'd be slow about it, but he'd get the intimacy they shared back. He really didn't want anything more.
On Friday Amy caught an error in one of the summary reports that required two hours of backtracking. Max stayed until midnight helping her fix it. Kim cursed his computer system for freezing during a critical update.
Saturday was quieter, just half the team working through remaining items. By Monday afternoon, the last files got submitted.
The team erupted in cheers.
"Finally," Ela breathed, collapsing back in her chair.
Luc stood up. "We're getting drinks. Everyone. No excuses."
"I have plans—" Kim started.
"Cancel them."
"I don't actually have plans."
"Then you're coming."
Jay joined this time. He felt it was deserved. They'd struggled for months, and now finally they'd reached the finish line. Even Zoe was there.
They went to Murphy's, their favorite pub, crowding into a large booth near the back. The atmosphere was boisterous from the start, everyone vividly complaining about being put through hell.
"I barely slept," Ela said dramatically. "I aged ten years."
"You look the same," Max pointed out.
"That's kind, but I know I look terrible."
Jay ordered a beer, then another. The alcohol made everything slightly fuzzy and warm. He complained alongside everyone else.
"Database management is absolutely unfair," he announced to Kim, who was sitting across from him.
Kim's face lit up. "I knew it! I knew you were still depressed about the dropped table."
"It's a legitimate grievance."
"It was months ago."
"And I'm still bitter."
"Jay holding a grudge. Write this down, someone."
"I'm just pointing out that database management is poorly designed."
"Keep going. Tell me more."
"The restore process is needlessly complicated."
"Amazing."
Jay smiled to himself. His great mistake that had affected him so much was nothing more than an anecdote to tease him about over beer.
The evening continued. People ordered food. Conversations overlapped and blended together. Jay told a story about his youngest brother demanding gifts that had Zoe laughing. Kim and Luc argued about some technical specification.
By ten o'clock, people started leaving. Zoe left first, Kim and Ela followed shortly after.
Eventually only Jay and Luc remained.
"I should go," Jay said, checking his phone. "I have to get up early tomorrow."
"Overachiever," Luc muttered.
"Says the man who lives at the office."
"Not anymore. I'm a changed man."
Jay left. Outside, the rain had stopped. The streets were wet and reflective under the streetlights. Jay called a taxi and waited, hands in his pockets, looking up at the dark sky.
Scene 4
Denial
The atmosphere lightened as the quarterly reporting period ended. Overtime ended overnight, and everyone, Jay included, left at five for the remainder of the week. The beginning of April was still cold and damp, but the daily lunch outings returned enthusiastically.
Easter and the upcoming quarterly party dominated the conversations.
"Four days off. Four entire days," Ela said dreamily at Monday's lunch. 
"I'm sleeping for three of them," Luc announced.
"What about the fourth?"
"More sleeping."
On Tuesday at the gym, Jay cornered Rus by the weight rack.
"I need a favor."
"What kind of favor?"
"I need you and the guys to help me move. In a couple of weeks."
"Move? So you're actually doing it?"
"Yes. And you all owe me for that unfortunate incident where the police got called because you were too loud in my studio."
Rus had the decency to look sheepish. "That was one time."
"One time too many."
"Fine, fine. I'll get the guys to organize a van. When do you need us?"
"I'll let you know the exact date once everything's finalized. Probably mid-April."
"We'll be there. But I still think your job is unreasonable."
"I know you do."
"Working until ten every night for a week straight—"
"It was manageable this time."
"That doesn't make it reasonable."
"It's getting better."
At lunch on Wednesday, Jay made his announcement.
"I'm buying the apartment."
The table erupted.
"Finally!" Zoe said.
"Congratulations!" Amy reached across to pat his hand.
"About time. You've been agonizing over this for months," Max added.
Luc grumbled into his soup. "Insufficient space for entertaining, though."
"I'm not planning to entertain."
"That's what everyone says until they actually want to have people over."
"It has a balcony," Jay pointed out. 
"A balcony is not entertaining space." 
"It's better than what I have now." 
"Barely."
The topic moved to Easter plans. Everyone shared theirs—family dinners, short trips, lazy weekends at home.
"I'm visiting my family," Jay said.
"That's nice," Ela said. "How long has it been?"
"Too long." 
"What are you doing for Easter?" Zoe asked Luc.
"Enjoying myself. No girlfriend means no suffering through her family nagging me about my career prospects and when we're getting married."
"That's the spirit," Max said dryly.
Jay had already placed a request for the company car beforehand. He was picking it up that afternoon, since the next day was the party and the day after was already off for the holidays.
He collected it after work. The limousine was waiting in the garage, sleek and black and completely excessive. He was no longer surprised, just resigned.
He drove it home, acutely aware of every other vehicle on the road. When he arrived at his building, he parked right outside his window, where he could see it from his flat.
It's insured, he told himself. Safe area. Nothing will happen. He repeated this to himself several times but still felt nervous.
The next day was Thursday, the final day before Easter, and the quarterly party. Everyone left work promptly to have enough time to prepare.
Jay wore his original navy suit. It was the only appropriate evening attire he'd left unpacked. He arrived by taxi, scanned the venue, approved of the lavish setting, and, as tradition demanded, found the buffet.
This time the team looked in much better spirits. The worst was behind them. Everyone was looking forward to the warm season. Vacation plans were the main topic of the evening.
"What about you, Jay?" Amy asked. "Any plans?"
"Just making myself at home in the new apartment."
Everyone nodded and offered advice with various levels of usefulness.
"Get good curtains," Zoe said. "Light control is everything."
"Invest in a proper mattress," Max added. "Your back will thank you."
"Don't buy too much furniture at once," Kim said. "Live in the space first, see what you actually need."
Jay nodded along, but remembered none of it.
Later in the evening, he spotted Luc at the bar, leaning close to a woman from legal. She was pretty, graceful, with a cheerful laugh.
Jay waited until Luc stepped away to order another drink, then intercepted him.
"What's up with you and Kia?"
Luc grinned. "What do you mean?"
"A couple of months ago, you said dating at the workplace was an awful idea."
"That was when I was in a relationship and level-headed. Now that I'm free, I'm much less concerned with what's wise and more with what feels good."
"That's terrible logic."
"Look at Kim and Ela. They're perfectly fine."
Jay had to admit it was true. Kim and Ela had been dating in secret for months, and their relationship hadn't impacted work or the team in any way. They weren't even all that sneaky anymore. Jay was sure everyone was aware. They simply chose not to address it directly.
"Still," Jay said.
Luc laughed and clapped him on the shoulder. "Anyway, why are you asking? Are you interested in someone? Maybe Jen from accounting? She's been trying to hit on you for ages."
Jay sighed deeply. "She's just being friendly."
"She's definitely not just being friendly."
"Even if it was more, I'm not interested. She's nice enough but we really don't have anything in common."
"Fair. But you should date someone eventually. You're too young to be this solitary."
"I'm fine."
"If you say so."
The party continued in good spirits. Ian found Jay in the other half of the venue, loading a plate of appetizers for what had to be the fourth time that evening.
"You already have a reputation for being a glutton," Ian said, sounding amused.
Jay shrugged. "At least it's better than having a reputation for dropping tables."
"That was months ago. No one remembers."
"I remember."
"What do you think of the venue?"
Jay looked around. "It's nice enough. But I liked the summer one last year much more. And I can't even remember the fall one."
"At least everyone looks better than last time. So maybe there's hope."
They chatted a bit more about the ambiance and the food. Eventually, Ian excused himself.
"I should go entertain Turner Senior. He's been glaring at me from across the room."
"Good luck with that."
"Enjoy the rest of your evening."
Ian left. Jay watched him go for a moment, following his path through the crowd. He was undoubtedly the most handsome man in the room. There were plenty of good-looking men at the party, but no one was quite as magnetic as Ian.
No wonder Jay felt flustered at the idea of being in love with him. He was sure everyone had their moments of gay panic when looking at Ian. Who wouldn't. Ian was... well, difficult to resist.
Jay sighed deeply again. He was sighing a lot that evening.
He finished his appetizers, made polite conversation with a few more colleagues, then said his farewells and called a taxi back home. He checked on the limousine through his window—still there, untouched—and collapsed into bed.
Tomorrow, he'd rest. And the day after, he was going to see his family.
He fell asleep thinking about the drive ahead and about the groceries waiting to be packed. Not about Ian's profile in the dim party lighting, or the way his voice had softened when they spoke. Definitely not about that.
Scene 5
Festive breakfast
Jay spent Easter Friday cleaning his apartment. Soon he'd move out. He wanted everything to be neat and tidy.
He moved his boxes near the exit, stacking them against the wall. Then he packed some of the remaining items he was still using occasionally—textbooks, a few dishes, the rest of his clothes. He left only the most immediate ones and toiletries. By the end of the day, the place was ready to be vacated.
Saturday morning he loaded the groceries and gifts into the limousine. He wore his newly bought clothes that looked a bit too elegant to truly pass as casual in his mind. Even the jeans from the upscale boutiques seemed somehow more posh. He dug out one of the sports jackets from one of the boxes to finish the look. He checked himself in the mirror. Nice, but not too ostentatious. He was reasonably content with the result. 
He left early. Traffic was minimal on the holiday weekend, so he arrived at his mother's house by noon. His mother greeted him at the door, pulling him into a warm embrace.
"Jay! You're here!"
"Hi, Mum."
"Come in, come in. You look wonderful. So grown up."
"Jay!" Ema practically tackled him with a hug. Tim and Ari crowded close behind.
"Did you bring the gifts?" Ari asked immediately.
"Hello to you too."
"But did you?"
"Yes, I brought gifts."
"I knew it!"
"Let him breathe, you three. Come in, Jay. You must be tired from the drive."
"I'm fine. Traffic was light."
His stepfather appeared briefly in the hallway.  "I'll be in the garden if anyone needs me."
They exchanged polite nods before he retreated to the garden to do whatever garden activities he preferred. That was their dynamic. Cordial distance.
His siblings, however, had no such reservations. They descended immediately.
"Did you attend any great balls recently?" Ema asked.
"A few," Jay admitted.
"Did you meet any movie stars?" Ari demanded.
"No movie stars."
"That's boring."
"Sorry to disappoint."
Jay unloaded the groceries in the kitchen. His mother followed, already pulling out pots and pans.
"You didn't have to bring all this," she said, peering into the bags.
"I wanted to help with the cooking."
"You don't need to cook. You're a guest."
"I insist."
They baked hams and stuffed poultry and chopped vegetables for salads. His mother directed, Jay followed. The kitchen filled with comforting smells—herbs, roasting meat. The kids drifted in and out, stealing bits of food and asking questions about the city.
In the afternoon, they painted eggs. All of them participated eagerly, even Tim who claimed it was childish but picked up a brush anyway. Ari made his bright green. Ema created delicate patterns. Jay painted simple stripes.
"Yours are boring," Ari announced.
"They're classic."
"Boring."
As evening approached, the siblings cornered him.
"Take us for a ride in the limousine," Tim said.
"Please, Jay. Just a short drive."
"It's not my car. It's a company car."
"But you're allowed to use it, right?"
"Yes, but—"
"Then let's go!"
Jay sighed theatrically. "Fine. But only for an hour."
They piled in, Tim claiming the front seat immediately. Jay drove them by the lake, despite the poor weather. The kids pressed against the windows, pointing out the landmarks. Ari fiddled with every button he could find. Ema took approximately fifty photos.
They only returned when it turned dark, the siblings chattering the entire way back.
The next day was typical continental Easter. Festive breakfast full of eggs, various hams and sausages, and three kinds of potato salads. It was loud and lively, everyone talking over each other.
Jay dispensed the gifts after breakfast. The kids were ecstatic.
"You got exactly what I wanted!" Ema squealed, hugging the weird-shaped lipsticks.
Ari tore open the superhero set with abandon. "This is perfect!"
Tim examined the modular hammock system. "Thanks, Jay."
There was also an entire bag of sweets, with some designer pralines for his mother and stepfather.
"You didn't have to spend so much," his mother said softly.
"I wanted to."
Lunch was equally excessive. Multiple courses, everyone eating until they couldn't move. Jay stayed over until afternoon, spending the whole day lounging about and eating. It felt domestic, nostalgic even.
His mother narrated family news while Jay mostly listened. Distant relatives getting married, neighbors moving away, local scandals Jay had no context for. Finally, he told them. "If everything resolves well, I'm buying a small apartment."
The kids erupted.
"You must absolutely host us over!" Ari insisted.
"It's quite small," Jay warned.
"We don't care."
"Ari and I will sleep on the floor. We want to see the city," Tim said. 
"We'll be so good. You won't even notice us," Ema promised.
"I'll definitely notice you."
But he promised anyway. "When I’m properly moved in, I’ll invite you."
His mother's eyes filled with tears. "Jay. I'm so happy for you."
She held his hand across the table, squeezing tightly. Before he left, she hugged him for a long time.
"I know your childhood wasn't the easiest. And I'm so glad you're doing well now."
Jay returned the embrace. "It was quite alright, Mum. I remember my early years fondly, despite everything. The neighborhood was quaint, if nothing else. The countryside was beautiful. It was a good place for a kid to grow up."
"You're kind to say so."
"I mean it."
She held him a moment longer, then released him. "Drive safely."
"I will."
His mother packed him a bunch of leftovers and homemade cakes. He loaded them into the car, waved goodbye, and drove back to the city.
He returned home late and tired. The apartment looked even emptier than before, boxes stacked by the door like silent sentinels. He showered quickly and dropped into bed.
Monday he spent eating the leftovers and browsing interior decor websites. The apartment was furnished, but minimally. While it looked nice, Jay already thought about functional improvements. Maybe a different table. Maybe another bookshelf. Perhaps some proper curtains. It still felt fragile to plan things like that. Like he didn't trust something wouldn't go wrong at the last moment.
