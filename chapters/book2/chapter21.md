Chapter 21: Summer heat
Scene 1
Vigilance
Ian arrived at the office the next morning with the peculiar exhaustion that came from overthinking. The previous evening's revelation had crystallized into cold practicality during the night hours. He was in love with Jay. This was unacceptable. He would manage it appropriately.
The solution was straightforward. Ensure Jay's continued success and happiness within the company and accept that his own discomfort was the necessary price for keeping things stable. He wanted Jay to thrive, to find joy and fulfilment, even if that meant watching from a distance. 
The selfish part of him that craved to keep Jay close warred with the protective instinct that whispered he should transfer Jay to another department, create space for both their sakes. Yet the thought of losing their daily interactions, the comfortable warmth of their established routine, felt unbearable.
He threw himself into work, but his mind was elsewhere. When the team departed for lunch at one of nearby restaurants, he remained at his desk, absorbed in market analysis. He preferred eating alone in the kitchen, but today the thought of food made him nauseous. His meal prep container sat untouched in the company refrigerator.
An hour later, the team returned rejuvenated. Jay moved toward the kitchen, ostensibly to refill his water bottle. He opened the fridge and paused at the sight of Ian's untouched lunch container.
This wasn't normal. In the year Jay had worked here, Ian's habits had been absolutely consistent. The lunch container was always gone by the time they returned to the office.
The afternoon progressed with meetings and conference calls that required Ian's full attention. He welcomed the distraction that prevented his thoughts from wandering to the sounds of Jay working just outside his office door.
A knock interrupted his brooding.
"Come in."
Jay entered, closing the door behind him. "I wanted to check if your lunch wasn't to your liking today."
Ian looked up, confused. "What?"
"You didn't eat lunch. I thought perhaps you'd prefer something different. I could order takeout if you'd like something specific." Jay's tone was matter-of-fact, as if monitoring Ian's eating habits was a part of his responsibilities. "There's a place that makes excellent soup if you're in the mood for something light."
The observation caught Ian completely off guard. He hadn't realized Jay paid attention to such details, much less that he would feel comfortable addressing them directly.
"I..." Ian paused, uncertain how to respond. "Yes, please. The soup sounds fine."
Jay nodded and retreated to his desk to place the order. Ian stared after him, processing what had just occurred. Jay had noticed his skipped meal and taken initiative to remedy it. The gesture was practical and unassuming, yet it represented a level of attentiveness that felt almost intimate.
Thirty minutes later, Jay collected the soup from the delivery service and brought it to the kitchen, along with proper utensils and a cloth napkin from the supply cabinet.
Ian appeared a few minutes later. 
"This looks appetizing," he said, sitting at the table.
The soup was excellent—rich and comforting, exactly what he needed though he hadn't realized it. Jay had returned to his desk, leaving him to eat in solitude as always. As he ate, he dwelled on the strange progression of his relationship with Jay.
Months ago, Jay had approached him with questions about past acquisitions and Ian had rebuffed him sharply. Today, Jay had essentially directed him to eat lunch, and Ian had complied without protest. The change in their dynamic was remarkable, though he couldn't pinpoint exactly when it had occurred.
The care Jay had shown was sincere and undemanding. No expectation of gratitude or acknowledgement, just attention to Ian's well-being. It was this thoughtfulness that made Jay so valuable as an assistant.
When he returned to his office, Jay was organizing files. Their eyes met briefly, and Jay smiled before returning to his work.
Ian sat at his desk, unsettled by how good it felt to be looked after in such simple ways. Jay probably considered meal monitoring part of his general duties, but the warmth it produced was dangerous. Ian wanted to protect that gentle consideration, to ensure Jay never lost the confidence that allowed him to offer help so naturally.
The thought produced both affection and despair in equal measure. This careful, honest young man deserved to be cherished and protected. Ian wanted to shield him from every possible harm. But doing so would cross lines that existed for good reasons.
Meanwhile, Jay returned to his filing with growing concern. The skipped lunch wasn't an isolated incident—he had noticed Ian's distraction throughout the day, the way he seemed to be avoiding casual interaction more than usual.
He glanced at the gleaming watch on his wrist. Ian’s unexpected gift had been accompanied by an even more surprising apology, an expression of regret for past oversights and missteps. The memory of Ian’s hesitant sincerity troubled Jay deeply, and now today’s skipped lunch and increasingly avoidant behaviour only added to his growing mental tally of concerns. Each unusual action felt like another warning sign.
Combined with Ian's adamant refusal to take vacation time, the pattern indicated stress levels that could become problematic. Ian's work ethic was already intense enough to worry Jay. If he started skipping meals on top of everything else, he would make himself seriously ill.
Jay had grown comfortable enough with their working relationship to address the lunch situation directly, something that would have been unthinkable months earlier. The realization surprised him. When had he stopped feeling that reverent distance that once made Ian seem untouchable? When had concern for Ian's health become something he felt entitled to express?
The transformation had occurred so gradually he hadn't noticed it happening. Now Ian felt less like an intimidating superior and more like... Jay wasn't sure how to categorize it. Someone worth looking after. Someone who mattered to him.
He would need to be more vigilant about Ian's habits. Discrete monitoring of lunch consumption, gentle reminders about breaks, perhaps even strategic scheduling of meetings to prevent excessively long work days. Jay glanced toward Ian's office. The soup had obviously helped, which validated Jay's intervention. Someone needed to ensure he took proper care of himself, and Jay was positioned to notice details that others might miss.
Ian remained in his office, and Jay stayed as well, finishing reports that weren't strictly urgent. At six, he prepared a glass of fresh lemonade from the kitchen supplies—unsweetened, with ginger and mint from the herb selection he'd suggested for the office.
He knocked on Ian's door frame again.
"I thought you might like something refreshing."
Ian accepted the glass without question this time. "Thank you."
"It's all natural ingredients. Ginger and mint are good for fatigue."
He left the lemonade on Ian's desk and returned to his work, remembering how Ian had once prepared ginger tea for him when he'd felt unwell. The gesture had meant more than Ian could have known—a sign that someone in this office actually cared about his welfare.
Now, months later, Jay wanted to offer the same consideration.
Scene 2
Planned departures
Ian made a point of eating his packed lunch every day for the rest of the week. The container disappeared punctually during the team's restaurant visits, which seemed to ease the watchful concern in Jay's expression.
As days passed, Ian's initial panic about his feelings lessened. Nothing fundamental had changed, he told himself. The longing had been present for months, he had simply stopped pretending it didn't exist. Recognition didn't require action.
By Thursday, he'd evaluated the projected workload through December and identified a window. Late October showed the lightest commitments, with most major quarterly reviews completed and year-end preparations still weeks away.
Friday afternoon, he called Jay into his office.
"I've decided to take some time off. Last week of October."
Jay's face lit up immediately. "That's wonderful. A full week?"
"Seven days. Monday through Friday."
"I'll submit my request for the same period." Jay's enthusiasm was unmistakable. "A week seems short, but it's much better than nothing."
Ian felt warmth at Jay's obvious pleasure in his decision. "You don't have to coordinate your schedule with mine."
"I'd rather take time when you do. Thank you for being reasonable about this."
That weekend, Jay threw himself into vacation planning. He browsed travel websites, eventually deciding on a week-long tropical getaway that included a beginner diving certification course.
The price made him pause—a year ago, such an expense would have been impossible. But his financial stability had grown along with his confidence, and the cost fell within reasonable limits.
He booked the trip Sunday evening, then researched local diving schools to supplement the vacation training. Zoe had mentioned several reputable instructors during her own diving stories, and Jay found classes that would prepare him for the more intensive tropical course.
Monday brought Zoe's return, bronzed and energetic from her underwater adventures. The team gathered at lunch, eager for details about her expedition.
"The coral formations were incredible," she said, showing photos on her phone. "Visibility was perfect, water temperature ideal. I spent two days just photographing reef fish."
"How deep did you go?" Luc asked.
"Forty meters on the wall dives. But the best sites were actually shallower—more marine life activity."
Jay looked at the images with fascination. "I booked a certification course myself. Tropical location, beginner program."
"Really?" Zoe's expression brightened. "Where?"
"Lagoon Belt. Week-long package with classroom and open water training."
"That's ambitious for a first course. Most people start with pool sessions."
"They include preliminary training. And I found local classes here to prepare."
Zoe pulled out her phone again. "Which school? I know several excellent instructors in the city."
Jay showed her the diving centre's website, and Zoe nodded approvingly.
"I know someone who teaches there. She's patient with beginners but maintains high safety standards."
"Would you like to come to my first lesson? This Thursday evening."
"Absolutely. We can grab dinner afterwards and discuss equipment basics."
Around the table, the team exchanged glances. Zoe's mentoring relationship with Jay was starting to approach friendship, a development that was fairly unexpected.
Amy returned on Monday as well, bringing the team back to full capacity just as Luc and Max prepared for their own departures. The office was fully staffed for five days before the next round of absences began.
Jay had grown so accustomed to extended hours that he remained late even with full coverage. Tuesday evening, when he typically left promptly for the gym, he stayed until past six o'clock.
Ian noticed the deviation. "Did you quit the gym?"
Jay looked up from his computer. "No, I moved my schedule an hour later. I'll go straight from here."
He opened his office closet to reveal a gym bag. "More convenient than going home first."
"How is your routine progressing?"
Jay's expression turned sheepish. "I'm far from fit, but definitely stronger than a few months ago. The trainer says my form has improved."
Ian was curious about this aspect of Jay's life. He'd spent months maintaining distance, but what purpose did that serve now? He was already compromised. These small insights into Jay's daily existence were the only intimacy he could permit himself.
"What type of training do you focus on?"
"Basic strength training, some cardio. Nothing sophisticated. The gym I chose is more practical than impressive, but it suits my needs."
"Consistency matters more than intensity."
"That's what I keep telling myself when I'm struggling with weights that probably seem trivial to most people."
The self-deprecation was typical of Jay, but Ian detected something else underneath the modest assessment. Jay was proud of his progress, even if he wouldn't admit it directly.
"Building habits takes discipline," Ian said. "The results will follow."
Jay smiled at the encouragement. "Thank you. I should get going if I want to make my session time."
"Have a good workout."
"Thank you."
Ian watched Jay gather his belongings and head toward the elevators. The brief conversation had revealed details about Jay's life that felt almost intimate in their ordinariness—gym habits, personal goals, small victories in self-improvement.
He wanted to know more. What other changes had Jay made in his life over the past year? What did he do on weekends? How did he spend his evenings when he wasn't working late?
The curiosity was dangerous but irresistible. Ian was already emotionally invested, seeking these small glimpses into Jay's world couldn't make the situation worse. If he couldn't have Jay in any meaningful way, at least he could indulge in learning about the person who had become so important to him.
What harm could a few casual questions cause? He was already in too deep for caution to matter, and he intended to take advantage of every opportunity Jay offered.
The decision felt like a small surrender, but also like relief. He would ask about Jay's diving lessons, his vacation plans, his weekend activities. He would show interest in Jay's life because he cared, and because denying that care had become more exhausting than acknowledging it.
He could find peace in that. Love didn't require possession. It could exist as pure wish for another person's flourishing, even if that flourishing led them away from him. Perhaps especially then.
Scene 3
Diving lesson
The full staff roster meant Jay could leave on Thursday promptly at five without guilt—a reprieve that wouldn't return until September when vacation season concluded. Zoe met him at the elevator, holding a waterproof duffel bag containing serious diving equipment.
"Ready for this?" she asked as they descended toward the lobby.
"As ready as I can be for voluntarily submerging myself in water while breathing through a tube."
"That's the spirit."
The dive centre had multiple training pools of varying depths and a classroom area filled with equipment displays. Jay felt his nervousness increase as they approached the facility.
"Remember," Zoe said as they entered, "you've done this before. Today is just building proper foundations."
The instructor, a weathered woman named Ina who clearly knew Zoe well, guided Jay through equipment basics. Mask fitting, regulator breathing, buoyancy control—all concepts Jay recognized but still needed to practice.
"Don't overthink it," Ina advised as Jay struggled with buoyancy in the shallow end. "Your body knows how to float."
Zoe accompanied him in the water but left instruction to Ina, offering encouragement from a distance. Jay appreciated the balance—moral support without interference. His movements were clumsy and his breathing occasionally erratic, but the panic from his first diving experience was notably absent.
By the end of the session, Jay had managed several controlled descents to the pool's deepest section and felt moderately confident about basic skills. Not graceful, but functional enough to imagine enjoying the activity.
"Much better than I expected," Ina concluded as they returned equipment. "September lessons will build on this foundation nicely."
"How many more sessions would you recommend before my trip?" Jay asked.
"Four or five should give you solid confidence for open water diving. "
"You might consider adding pool time for general water comfort," Zoe said as they changed back into street clothes. "There's excellent facilities throughout the city."
"That's a good idea. I want to be completely prepared."
Zoe proposed dinner at a nearby restaurant to discuss the experience, and Jay readily agreed. The invitation felt natural after their successful lesson, though he realized he knew very little about Zoe beyond her office persona.
"You made that look effortless," Jay observed over appetizers. "How long have you been diving?"
"Since college. Being a city kid, it was the only way to experience anything resembling nature."
"You're from here originally?"
"Born and raised. Third generation native, actually, which makes me practically prehistoric by local standards."
"I still feel awkward about living here. Small town to big city isn't exactly seamless."
"Nobody cares where you're from. Trust me, half our office moved here from somewhere else. You blend in perfectly now."
The reassurance was unexpectedly comforting. Jay had assumed his origins were more obvious than they apparently were.
"Speaking of blending in," Jay said, "I've been apartment hunting. Any neighbourhood recommendations?"
"What's your priority? Short commute, nightlife, quiet residential?"
"Definitely short commute. I spend enough time at the office that I'd prefer not to waste hours traveling. But it still needs to be something I can afford."
Zoe launched into detailed advice about areas with convenient metro access that remained reasonably priced. Her knowledge of the city was encyclopedic, covering everything from grocery stores to safety considerations.
"Avoid anything within walking distance of the financial district unless you enjoy paying exorbitant prices for a closet," she warned. "But there are some great neighbourhoods three stops out that give you space without sacrificing convenience."
Jay enjoyed the conversation. Zoe was more talkative and personable than in the office, with practical insights about city living that Jay hadn't considered. Their conversation eventually returned to his upcoming trip, covering travel experiences, equipment recommendations, and underwater photography techniques.
"I never realized you were so adventurous," Jay said.
"Most people don't. I prefer keeping work and personal interests separate."
"But you made an exception tonight."
"You're interested in diving, not just looking for another social activity."
"This has been really helpful," Jay said as they prepared to leave. "Thank you for coming along."
"My pleasure. Text me after your next lesson—I want to hear how the skills progression goes."
Meanwhile, Ian remained in the office well past normal hours, ostensibly reviewing client portfolios but actually achieving very little productive work. The afternoon had dragged without Jay, punctuated by mundane tasks that felt more tedious than usual.
He knew Jay was at his diving lesson with Zoe, pursuing an activity that would enhance his upcoming vacation. This was positive development—Jay expanding his interests, building friendships with colleagues, gaining confidence in new skills.
Ian should feel pleased about Jay's growth and happiness. Instead, he wished he could be the one accompanying Jay to new experiences, sharing in discoveries and celebrations. The thought of Jay laughing with Zoe, discussing vacation plans, produced discomfort that Ian recognized as dangerously close to jealousy.
The realization was unwelcome. He wanted to be part of Jay's life. Instead, he sat alone in an empty office, pretending to work while actually counting the hours until Jay returned tomorrow morning. By seven o'clock, Ian abandoned any pretence of productivity and headed home, taking with him work that would likely remain untouched for the remainder of the evening.
Back in his apartment, Jay researched swimming facilities near the office. He found a modern complex with extended hours, including evening sessions that would accommodate his irregular schedule. Pool time could supplement diving lessons while improving general fitness.
The schedule would require planning around his extended work hours, but Jay didn't mind. Tuesday afternoons would remain reserved for gym sessions, while other evenings could incorporate swimming when he managed to leave by reasonable hours.
The gym training had given him confidence in his physical capabilities that extended beyond simple strength improvement. Adding swimming felt like a natural progression.
He booked a trial membership for the following week, already anticipating the additional preparation it would provide for his diving adventure. The diving lesson had reinforced his excitement about the upcoming vacation while highlighting areas for improvement.
Jay fell asleep reviewing certification requirements and equipment lists. The lesson had gone better than expected, Zoe had proven an unexpectedly compatible companion, and his vacation planning was proceeding smoothly.
Scene 4
Sunset brooding
Ian arrived at the office Friday morning to find Jay already at his desk, reviewing client correspondence. The sight produced a flutter of warmth that Ian immediately recognized as absurd—he had missed Jay for exactly one afternoon, yet his relief at seeing him again felt disproportionate to the brief separation.
"Good morning," Jay said cheerfully, looking up from his work.
Ian's heart responded with a skip. The ridiculousness of pining like a Victorian widow over a few hours apart wasn't lost on him, but awareness didn't diminish the feeling.
"Good morning," Ian replied, and instead of proceeding directly to his office, he paused beside Jay's desk. "How did the diving lesson go yesterday?"
Jay responded with evident enthusiasm. "Better than expected. I managed not to panic underwater, which feels like progress. The instructor thinks I won't drown on my vacation, which is reassuring."
"That's encouraging."
"I'm also planning to add swimming. There's a pool with convenient hours near the office, so I can fit in sessions when my schedule allows."
"Swimming is excellent preparation for diving. Building comfort in water translates well to underwater activities."
"That's what Zoe mentioned. She's been very helpful with practical advice."
The brief conversation concluded naturally, but Ian retained the warmth of it throughout the morning. He savoured these small moments of connection, finding comfort in the glimpses into Jay's life that felt intimate simply because they were so casual.
Jay returned his attention to his computer, unconsciously touching the watch face. The weight on his wrist still felt alien. He had never worn jewellery of any kind, finding accessories excessive and unnecessary. Now the constant reminder of Ian's unexpected generosity felt increasingly significant.
Throughout the day, Ian noticed Jay's expanded social interactions with their colleagues. Previously, Luc had been Jay's primary conversational partner for casual office exchanges. Now Jay chatted with Zoe as well—brief discussions about diving techniques, city neighbourhoods, weekend plans that Ian couldn't help overhearing from his adjacent office.
"Here's my number," Zoe said during one such conversation. "Text me about those pool recommendations I mentioned."
Ian felt an unreasonable stab of jealousy at the casual exchange of personal contact information. He had Jay's number from HR files, but technical access felt entirely different from the personal gesture of voluntary sharing. As Jay's supervisor, he couldn't simply request personal numbers without justification. The jealousy was irrational and petty, but it left Ian feeling moody for the remainder of the afternoon.
As evening approached, Max's upcoming vacation created additional preparation demands that kept both Ian and Jay working past normal hours. Ian deliberately extended tasks that could have been completed more efficiently, reluctant to end the day and lose Jay's company.
By eight o'clock, Jay appeared tired and hungry, gathering his belongings with the obvious intention of departing. He approached Ian's office door, which had remained open throughout the day.
"I'm heading out," Jay said. "Are you planning to work much later?"
Ian glanced at his computer screen, where no meaningful work was actually in progress. "I want to finish something I'm working on. Don't wait on my account."
The lie came easily, though Ian immediately felt guilty about it. He wasn't working on anything pressing, he was simply stalling because he wanted to preserve these moments for as long as possible.
"Have a good evening," Jay said.
"You too."
Ian watched Jay collect his things and head toward the elevators, fighting the impulse to call him back with some fabricated urgent task. After Jay disappeared from view, Ian remained at his desk, staring at the city skyline visible through his office windows.
Two full days without seeing Jay. Forty-eight hours of wondering what he was doing, whether he was enjoying his time off, if he thought about work—about Ian—at all during his personal hours.
Ian had never particularly enjoyed weekends, preferring the structure and purpose of office. Now he was beginning to actively dread them.
The August heat had been oppressive all week. The evening sun was beginning its descent toward the horizon, casting long shadows across the financial district. The sky held that particular quality of late summer light—golden and heavy, suggesting the gradual approach of autumn despite the continued warmth.
As the sun sank lower, painting the office in amber light, Ian acknowledged the futility of his position. He was in love with his assistant, jealous of his friendships, and inventing reasons to extend their shared time. None of it was sustainable, yet he couldn't imagine changing course.
The sunset continued its slow progression, and Ian continued watching, lost in thoughts that offered no solutions to his increasingly complicated feelings.
Jay rode the metro home with lingering concern about Ian's work habits. Staying past eight on Friday evening seemed excessive even by Turner & Associates standards, particularly when no urgent deadlines justified the extended hours.
Back in his apartment, Jay reheated leftover dinner and took a quick shower, exhaustion overtaking him as the week's activities caught up. As he prepared for bed, his eyes fell on the watch he had placed on his nightstand.
The anniversary gift still felt impossibly extravagant, something he probably shouldn't have accepted despite Ian's insistence. The monetary value remained staggering, but the expense wasn't what made the gift significant. It was the fact that Ian had chosen it, had taken time to consider what Jay might appreciate, had wanted to acknowledge their working relationship with something meaningful and permanent.
Jay fell asleep thinking about Ian's earnest apology, the careful way he had presented the gift, the concern he had shown for Jay's well-being throughout their year together. The watch had come from Ian, and that made it precious for reasons that had nothing to do with its cost.
Scene 5
Weekend exploration
On Saturday the heat was so oppressive that it made even the gym feel stifling despite its air conditioning. Jay completed his routine, eager to finish weekend chores before the temperature became truly unbearable. By noon, he had managed laundry, grocery shopping, and basic apartment maintenance, leaving the afternoon free for apartment hunting.
He texted Zoe for recommendations about which areas to prioritize, expecting a brief response with suggestions. Instead, she offered to accompany him on his exploration, which surprised Jay but also pleased him. A local's perspective would be invaluable for understanding neighbourhood dynamics he might miss entirely.
"I know the city better than any real estate website. Plus I have strong opinions about local amenities," she had replied.
They met at a metro station Zoe had selected for its central location among the areas Jay wanted to explore. She arrived with a water bottle, comfortable walking shoes, and a practical shoulder bag, clearly experienced with extended urban hiking.
She indicated the map on her phone. "Strategic planning. We can cover four neighbourhoods efficiently if we're systematic about it."
The heat was brutal, but Jay appreciated seeing potential areas under challenging conditions. If a neighbourhood felt acceptable during August's worst weather, it would be pleasant during milder seasons.
They spent the afternoon moving between neighbourhoods, riding metro lines to different stops and walking through residential areas that offered varying combinations of affordability, accessibility, and livability. Zoe provided running commentary about safety considerations and transportation reliability that Jay would never have discovered through online research alone.
"That building looks nice from the outside," Jay observed about a council house with attractive brick facades.
"Terrible insulation and no decent grocery stores within walking distance," Zoe replied immediately. "Trust me, aesthetic appeal isn't worth freezing in winter or living on takeout."
Several buildings caught Jay's attention as promising options. He made notes about agents to contact once September arrived and his work schedule became more manageable.
By evening, they were both exhausted from hours of walking in relentless heat. Zoe suggested dinner at a restaurant in one of the neighbourhoods Jay had found most appealing—a vegetarian place with outdoor seating and fans that created tolerable conditions despite the temperature.
Jay agreed readily, though vegetarian cuisine wasn't typically his preference. The restaurant was small and welcoming, with an extensive menu that was more appealing than he had anticipated.
"This is actually really good," he admitted, sampling a grain bowl with interesting spice combinations.
"You sound surprised."
"I default to more conventional food choices. But this has a lot more flavour than I expected."
Over dinner, their conversation drifted from apartment hunting to work experiences and personal backgrounds. Jay was relaxed, perhaps due to the informal setting or Zoe's easy-going demeanour.
"Can I ask why you applied to Turner & Associates specifically? It's not exactly an obvious choice for someone without extensive finance background," Zoe asked.
"Honestly? Ian's reputation was a major factor. His management style seemed principled and straightforward, without the complications I'd encountered elsewhere."
"Complications?"
"Previous supervisors who didn't maintain appropriate boundaries. Ian's known for hating office romance, which made the position feel safer."
Zoe nodded with understanding. "That was exactly my reasoning. Being openly gay can be tricky, but Ian's reputation made Turner & Associates feel like a place where I wouldn't have to worry about my sexuality becoming an issue."
The casual revelation surprised Jay, though he tried not to show it. "I'm glad the environment has lived up to expectations."
"It has, mostly because Ian really does provide excellent protection from workplace drama. I hope that doesn't make you uncomfortable. I'm private about personal details, but you seem like someone I can trust."
"Not uncomfortable at all. I may be from a small town, but I'm not quite that provincial."
Zoe visibly relaxed. "I tend to keep my head down out of habit. You never know who might have hidden prejudices, even in supposedly progressive environments. But I felt safe with you because, well, I assumed you were gay as well."
Jay felt heat rise in his face. "I don't really think I'm gay."
"Oh." Zoe looked mortified. "I'm sorry, I shouldn't have assumed—"
"It's alright, honestly. Not a big deal. I'm just not interested in dating anyone, truth be told."
Zoe's expression brightened with recognition. "Ah, so you're ace! That's wonderful. It's nice having one of us queers on the team."
Jay had never heard the term applied to himself before, but it didn't feel wrong. "I never thought much about it. There were always other priorities."
That wasn't entirely true. He had attempted romance back in college, but it had ended in such spectacular failure that he had never felt comfortable exploring that territory again. The memory still made him uncomfortable years later, but it wasn't something he was prepared to confess to anyone, let alone a coworker he was meeting privately for only the second time.
"Fair enough. Labels aren't for everyone anyway."
They continued talking as the evening cooled slightly, bonding over their shared appreciation for Ian's protective aura at work. Both had sought refuge in his reputation, and both had found exactly the security they needed.
"He really is impenetrable steel wall against workplace nonsense," Zoe observed. "I've never felt more comfortable in an office environment."
"Same. He creates this bubble of professionalism that keeps everything else at bay."
"Thanks for spending your Saturday on this. I learned more about these neighbourhoods in one afternoon than I would have managed in weeks of research," Jay said as they prepared to leave.
"It was fun. Let me know when you're ready to look at actual units. I have strong opinions about building management, too."
Jay left the restaurant feeling satisfied with both his apartment prospects and his expanding social circle. Having an actual friendship with a coworker was a new experience, but one he found remarkably pleasant.
