Chapter 31: Things that slip through fingers
Scene 1
Flood
February was unusually wet. There had been practically no snow this winter, just gloom and cold rain that seemed to seep into everything. The sky remained perpetually gray, pressing down on the city.
Strategy work initiated across all departments. Jay didn't participate in the actual strategic process—that remained the domain of senior analysts and executives—but the workload increased for everyone, which meant his management tasks multiplied accordingly. Tension was everywhere. Most of the team worked long hours, arriving early and leaving late.
Daily lunch outings were suspended indefinitely, replaced with takeout eaten at desks while reviewing documents. The office felt like a bunker, everyone hunkered down against the storm of demands.
Jay scheduled his meeting with the agent for Wednesday at six. On Monday he worked long hours, supporting Ian's immediate correspondence and managing the endless stream of administrative tasks. 
Tuesday he managed to escape for the gym. Rus greeted him with raised eyebrows.
"Two weeks in a row. I'm impressed."
"Don't get used to it. Next week will probably be worse."
"At least you're here now."
Jay pushed through his exercises, trying to work out the tension in his shoulders. It helped, but not enough. Rus spent the entire session complaining about the weather.
"It's like the sky is punishing us for something. When does it end?"
"Not anytime soon, according to the forecast."
"Fantastic. Just fantastic."
It rained again on Wednesday. Jay watched it streak down the office windows all afternoon, a downpour that showed no signs of stopping. At five, he packed up and headed for the metro station.
The station was chaos. A harried employee stood at the entrance with a megaphone, announcing that service was suspended citywide due to flooding. A tunnel had filled with water somewhere in the central district, shutting down the entire network.
Jay processed this information for a moment, then turned and headed back to street level. He'd have to take a taxi. The traffic would be terrible, but he had no other option.
He was right about the traffic. It was insane. Cars barely moved, trapped in gridlock created by the metro outage and the continuing rain. Everyone who normally took public transport was now competing for road space. Jay watched the minutes tick by with growing anxiety, sending apologetic texts to the agent as his arrival time slipped further and further back.
He arrived almost an hour late, practically running from where the taxi finally deposited him. The agent was waiting in the lobby, looking patient but concerned.
"I'm so sorry. The metro is down and the traffic was—"
"It's quite alright. Half the city is dealing with the same situation. Shall we go up?"
They took the elevator to the flat. Jay had been looking forward to seeing it again, to confirming his decision with fresh eyes. Instead, he felt sour from the stressful journey.
The apartment was exactly as he remembered. Compact but brilliantly designed. The agent walked him through the features again, pointing out details about the appliances and the building amenities.
But when they reached the balcony, Jay stopped. Rain was still falling, lighter now but persistent. Beyond the railing, the river raged. The water was high and fast, churning with debris, looking dangerous and hostile in the darkness.
"The river seems quite swollen," Jay observed.
"It's been a wet winter. But the building is well above any flood zones. You can check the city's flood simulation maps if you're concerned."
"I did check them before. The building is on a slope, supposedly safe."
"Supposedly?"
"It just looks menacing."
The agent smiled reassuringly. "I understand. Weather like this makes everything seem more dramatic than it is."
They returned inside. Jay had initially intended to sign the preliminary contract right away, to commit and move forward. Instead, he hesitated.
"I'd like to take the contract home to review it. Just to make sure everything’s done properly."
"Of course. Take all the time you need."
The agent handed over the documents in a neat folder, and they parted ways with promises to be in touch soon. At least the rain had stopped, though the sky remained dark and the air was damp.
Jay walked around the neighborhood instead of immediately calling a taxi. He wanted to get a feel for the area at night, to see if it still felt as appealing as it had during his previous visit.
It didn't. The parks that had looked inviting in daylight now appeared desolate. The trees were bare and skeletal, dripping water onto empty pathways. Streetlights created isolated pools of illumination surrounded by shadows. Jay thought he saw someone lurking near one of the park entrances—a figure that disappeared when he looked directly at it.
He told himself he was being paranoid. This was a safe neighborhood. People paid premium prices to live here precisely because it was secure and well-maintained. But the darkness and anxiety colored everything.
He found a restaurant and went inside. The place was elegant, all white tablecloths and subtle lighting. The other diners were couples in expensive clothing, speaking in low voices.
He ordered something simple and ate quickly, feeling out of place. The food was good but too refined, too expensive. Jay just wanted sustenance.
Afterwards, he walked some more. Almost without conscious decision, he approached Ian's building. It really was just a short walk away. Twelve minutes. Jay could confirm that estimate now.
He loitered outside the entrance, looking up at the tall structure. Lights glowed in some windows. Others were dark. He tried to pick out which one was Ian’s. He had a rough idea from before, but it was little more than a guess.
It was past eight when a car pulled up. Ian emerged and called Jay immediately.
"Jay? What are you doing here?"
Jay felt sheepish, caught in what felt like strange behavior even though he'd done nothing wrong. "I had an apartment viewing today. It got prolonged because of the metro situation. I was just seeing around the area."
"In the dark? In this weather?"
"I wanted to get a feel for the neighborhood."
"Still." Ian looked at him more closely. "Have you eaten?"
"Yes, just now."
"There's a café nearby that I like. We can have tea."
Jay followed. The café was small and warm, with minimal decoration and pleasant atmosphere. They ordered herbal teas since it seemed too late for coffee.
Jay wanted something warming to dispel the chill that had seeped into his bones. Instead, the tea turned out bitter and medicinal, just increasing his overall poor mood. He sipped it anyway, not wanting to seem ungrateful.
"How was the viewing?" Ian asked.
"Fine. The apartment is exactly as I remembered."
"You don't sound enthusiastic."
"I'm just tired. The journey was difficult. And anxious about the apartment. Big decision."  
"You don't have to proceed if you're having doubts."  
"I know. I just wish I felt more certain."
They talked about the neighborhood, about the convenience of the location. Ian mentioned his favorite routes through several of the parks Jay had just found so unsettling.
"It's lovely in spring," Ian said. "Everything blooms. Very different from tonight's atmosphere."
"I'm sure it is."
But Jay couldn't shake his unease. The river, the dark parks, the feeling of being watched. All of it clung to him like the dampness in the air.
They finished their tea and said their farewells outside the café. Jay called a taxi, and Ian waited with him until it arrived.
"Get some rest," Ian said. "You look exhausted."
"I will. Thank you for the tea."
Jay returned home feeling weary. Ian watched the taxi disappear, worry creasing his forehead. Something was wrong. Jay had looked tired and anxious, his brightness dimmed.
The next day at work was another session of long hours. The entire team, Jay included, worked past ten because on top of the normal workload, a client issue emerged that required immediate attention.
Ela was near tears by nine. "I can't look at another spreadsheet. I physically cannot."
"Just one more hour," Max said, though he looked equally defeated. "We're almost there."
"That's what you said two hours ago."
"This time I mean it."
Jay returned home with aching eyes and tense shoulders. He showered quickly and dropped into bed without eating. Sleep came immediately, heavy and dreamless. He was exhausted. Completely, utterly exhausted. And February had only just begun.
Scene 2
Database drama
The same gray sky and persistent drizzle that had plagued the entire week continued on Friday. Another day of ungodly long hours stretched ahead.
By evening, everyone was still hard at work. The office seemed like a submarine—sealed off from the outside world, running on artificial light and recycled air, everything slightly stale and oppressive.
Jay was helping Kim with database tasks. They'd been working on cleaning up some analytical queries, and Kim had shown him the basic procedures earlier in the week.
Jay had been working with a temporary table for processing a minor query. He'd finished with it and wanted to clean up. He copied the table name and executed the drop command.
The confirmation came back instantly. Table dropped. Jay stared at the screen. Something felt wrong. He scrolled up to look at what he'd actually executed.
His stomach dropped through the floor.
He hadn't pasted the temporary table name. He'd pasted the name of an actual table. One holding historical scoring data. Months of accumulated information, gone in a single keystroke.
Cold sweat broke out across his body immediately. His hands started shaking.
"No," he whispered. "No, no, no."
He frantically tried to undo it, knowing even as he did that it was impossible. You couldn't undo a drop. The data was gone. He checked the backup procedures, his heart hammering. This was the analytical schema, not one of the production ones. There was no automatic backup.
"Oh god. Oh god no."
He sat frozen for five minutes, staring at the screen, hoping somehow he'd misread what happened. But the reality was grim. He'd dropped a table they were actively using for multiple strategy processes. It wasn't on the list of absolutely crucial systems—the company wouldn't stop functioning—but it was still serious. Very serious.
And it was exactly the mistake he'd been warned multiple times never to commit. Don't accidentally drop a table. It had been one of the first things he'd learned when Kim started training him on database work.
He'd done it anyway.
Finally, moving like he was underwater, Jay got up and walked to Kim's desk. His face was pale, his hands still trembling.
Kim looked up. "Hey, did you finish—" He stopped. "What's wrong?"
"I made a mistake. A bad one."
"What kind of mistake?"
"I dropped a table. The scoring history table."
Kim's expression went blank. "You dropped it."
"Yes."
"The whole table."
"Yes."
Kim was quiet for a moment. "Okay. Okay, we need to tell Ian."
They walked to Ian's office together. Through the glass wall, Jay could see Ian reviewing documents. Kim knocked once and entered without waiting for permission.
Ian looked up. His eyes went immediately to Jay's face, and he furrowed his brows.  "What happened?"
"Jay dropped the scoring history table," Kim said. His tone was factual, not accusatory.
"Do we have a backup?"
"No. It's the analytical schema."
"Right." Ian was already reaching for his phone. "Contact emergency IT intervention immediately. We need retrieval specialists."
Kim nodded and pulled out his own phone, stepping aside to make the call.
Ian looked at Jay. "How did this happen?"
"I was cleaning up a temporary table. I copied the wrong name. I didn't check before I executed." Jay's voice was barely above a whisper. "I'm sorry. I'm so sorry."
"We'll deal with it. Go back to your desk. Kim will handle the IT report."
Jay wanted to say more, wanted to apologize again, wanted Ian to yell at him. But Ian already returned to his computer, drafting contingency communications. Focused on damage control, not blame.
Jay returned to his desk. Around him, the team had gone quiet. Word had spread, and the atmosphere grew even heavier. No one looked at him directly. They just stared at their screens with resigned expressions, the weight of yet another problem pressing down on everyone.
Zoe caught his eye briefly and sent him a sympathetic grimace. 
There was nothing to do now but wait for IT to determine if the data was retrievable. The table existed somewhere in the system's memory, possibly, if they could access the right logs before they cycled. But it was late. The on-call specialists would need time to respond.
Jay tried to return to other work but couldn't focus. The words and numbers on his screen were unintelligible. His eyes burned.
He'd failed. Spectacularly. Made exactly the mistake everyone was trained to avoid, a basic, stupid error that shouldn't happen. And he'd done it in the middle of strategy season, when they were already stretched impossibly thin, when everyone was stressed and running on fumes.
At eleven, Ian emerged from his office. "Everyone go home. We'll reconvene on Monday."
People began packing up slowly, exhaustion written into every movement. A few offered reassuring words to Jay as they left.
"It happens," Amy said.
"Could've been worse," Max added, which wasn't particularly comforting.
Kim paused at Jay's desk. "IT will figure something out."
"I'm sorry."
"I know. Go home. Get some rest."
Jay was the last to leave. He stood outside Ian's office door, trying to find words.
Ian looked up. "Go home, Jay."
"I don't know how this happened. I always double-check table names. I was warned about this a hundred times."
"I know. It happened. Now we deal with it."
"If they can't retrieve it—"
"We'll handle it."
As Jay was leaving, he could see Ian still in his office, phone pressed to his ear, coordinating with someone. Jay didn't say goodbye. He just gathered his things and walked to the elevator.
The metro ride felt suffocating. The fluorescent lights were too bright. Every station stop felt interminable.
He climbed the stairs to his apartment with leaden steps, unlocked the door, and went inside. He didn't turn on any lights. Just stripped off his clothes—jacket, shirt, trousers all dropped in a pile on the floor—and crawled into bed wearing only his underwear.
The tears came immediately, hot and shameful. He pressed his face into the pillow to muffle the sounds. His entire body shook with it—the fear, the humiliation, the crushing weight of having failed so badly at something so fundamental.
He hadn't eaten. Hadn't washed. He just cried until exhaustion finally pulled him under into sleep.
Outside, the rain started again, pattering against the window like an accusation.
Scene 3
Packing
Saturday arrived and Jay stayed in bed until noon, staring at the ceiling. He only got up when biology demanded it, moving through his tiny apartment like a ghost.
He'd skipped the gym. The thought of seeing Rus and having to pretend everything was fine was unbearable. He just wanted to hide.
Eventually he got dressed in sweatpants and stared at his apartment. The contract lay on the table where he'd left it days ago in an official folder. Jay couldn't look at it. Every time his eyes drifted in that direction, his stomach twisted.
He needed something to occupy his mind, to stop the endless replay of Friday evening. So he focused on packing and sorting.
Summer clothes went into one box. Books into another. He organized old documents, separating the ones he deemed necessary from those destined for the throwaway pile. Tax records, rental agreements, pay stubs from jobs he'd left behind—all of it got categorized.
He didn't own quite that many things. By the end of the weekend, he was mostly done. Only the items he used daily remained unpacked—toiletries, a few changes of clothes, basic kitchen supplies.
His apartment looked sad. Boxes stacked against walls, empty shelves, the sense of a space already abandoned.
He felt less sure than ever about the move, about buying an apartment that was so ridiculously upscale. That wasn't his world. Maybe he should move, but back to his town. The slow, boring life in the boonies would probably suit him better than this impossibly demanding city landscape. At least there, expectations were manageable. Mistakes weren't catastrophic.
While clearing out his bookshelf, Jay retrieved an envelope he normally stored hidden behind a row of textbooks. Ten thousand in two-hundred bills, placed neatly in an unassuming envelope. His emergency buffer.
He'd assembled it years ago, after his first job failed and he'd had to take a loan from his mother. The shame of that had burned. After he found a new job, he'd taken a part-time position for several months to repay her and to build a more robust emergency net. Having cash on hand made him feel safer. If something happened—if he lost everything again—at least he'd have this.
These days it wasn't as needed. His bank account was impressive. His job felt stable.
But that evening, as he held the solid envelope in his fingers, he felt precarious. The mistake he'd made probably wasn't severe enough to get him fired. But it wasn't his first mistake. It was a pattern.
The demands of the job were high. He'd always known that. His colleagues pushed through worse, but they were more qualified. More resilient. And he wasn't.
He wasn't sure he could endure much more of this, each one of his failures feeling so crushing. Ian had once told him that bad things happen and will keep happening. Ian was strong—he could withstand disasters. But Jay was increasingly convinced that he himself wasn't.
Maybe he should look for a lower-stakes position. Processing invoices, just like he used to. There had been none of this enormous burden, none of this stress. He was starting to wonder if any of it was worth it, if this misery was sustainable.
He placed the envelope on the table next to the apartment contract, wondering where he should pack it. Putting it in a box seemed too insecure, even though some of the items already packed were probably worth more. His designer outfits and three-piece suits were already tucked away, after all.
Sunday evening, he tidied up the apartment and threw away the trash bags, inspecting his handiwork. His place looked more or less ready to be vacated. All of his belongings stuck in several neat boxes, a life reduced to manageable containers.
But was he ready? He wasn't sure anymore. He felt that whatever future held for him, he probably wouldn't stay where he was. But where he'd go—that remained unclear.
He took a proper shower, the first real one since Thursday. The hot water felt good against his tense shoulders. He prepared his things for Monday. Suit pressed, shirt ironed, everything laid out and ready.
Tomorrow he would receive his sentence.
He lay in bed staring at the ceiling. The apartment was too quiet. The boxes loomed in the darkness like silent witnesses to his failure. Sleep came eventually, restless and thin.
Monday was gray and cold. Jay got dressed, ate breakfast without tasting it, and took the metro to work. His stomach was in knots the entire journey.
At the office, tension radiated from him like heat. He sat at his desk, trying to focus on his tasks, but his attention kept drifting to his email. Waiting. There was no news from IT until eleven. Then the message finally arrived, sent to Ian with the team copied.
"Table successfully restored from system logs. All historical data recovered."
Everyone breathed. The relief was palpable, spreading through the workspace. Kim sent Jay a thumbs up from across the room.
Jay felt as if a stone had fallen from his heart. His mistake was fixed. Thankfully, mercifully fixed.
But it didn't take away from the severity of his error. The crushing awareness that he'd made a mistake he'd been trained to avoid. That next time might not resolve so successfully. That the IT team had worked over the weekend to fix his stupidity.
Ian called him into his office at noon.
"The table is restored. We're back on track. Let's move forward."
"I'm sorry," Jay said again, because he couldn't help it.
"I know. But it's resolved now. Don't let it consume you."
Easy for Ian to say. Ian was strong enough to move past disasters.
That day, the whole team worked long hours again. The strategy season continued, relentless and demanding. Jay stayed until nine, throwing himself into assignments.
He returned home feeling marginally better. But only marginally.
The boxes in his apartment reminded him that his life was in flux, that everything felt unstable, that he wasn't sure he belonged anywhere anymore. He heated up leftovers, ate them quickly, showered, and went to bed early. Sleep came faster this time, exhaustion finally overcoming anxiety.
But his dreams were full of falling tables and disappearing data, of Ian's disappointed face and his own inadequacy laid bare for everyone to see.
Scene 4
Dread
The next day was Tuesday, so Jay left at five to go to the gym. Rus mercifully didn't comment on his absence last Saturday, but his eyes said enough.
Jay's form had slipped visibly. He used to occasionally work out at home, maintaining his strength between sessions. That had ceased completely in the past couple of weeks. Combined with his missed gym session and lack of sleep, he struggled with the exercises. Weights that had felt manageable before now seemed heavy. His movements were sloppy.
Rus watched him fail a set and shook his head. "You need another job. This one is going to kill you."
Jay didn't respond. Internally, he agreed. The strain was visible to the naked eye.
He returned home and at least cooked a decent dinner. Chicken and vegetables, nothing fancy but with proper nutrients. After eating, he decided to finish packing his documents.
He went to the coffee table where he'd left the money envelope. It wasn't there.
Jay stared at the empty surface for a moment, then looked around. Maybe he'd moved it. He checked the kitchen counter, the bookshelf, his desk. Nothing.
He looked under the table. In the boxes. Behind furniture. Nowhere.
He tried to remember. He'd taken it out of the bookshelf Saturday. Held it. Placed it on the table. And then... Sunday evening, he'd cleaned up. Tidied. Thrown away the pile of useless documents that had accumulated on the table.
Unless.
Cold sweat broke out across his back. Unless he'd mistakenly thrown it away with the rest of the pile. Just grabbed everything and dumped it in the trash without checking.
This was somehow even worse than the table incident. That had been a work mistake, serious but ultimately recoverable. This was personal. This was his safety net, his emergency buffer. Money he'd worked like a dog for at that dreadful weekend job at the gas station.
He'd hated every moment of those months. The rude customers, the unsafe neighbourhood, the harassment he'd endured. Standing behind bulletproof glass, getting yelled at by drunk people at two in the morning. All to build this buffer, to never have to borrow from his mother again.
The amount wasn't small. Over two months of his old salary. While he earned so much more now, it was still nothing to scoff at.
But it wasn't just about the money. It was about the sacrifice. About what that envelope represented—his determination to never be helpless again. And he'd thrown it away like garbage. Just like he'd dropped that table. Just like he kept making careless, stupid mistakes that proved he was fundamentally deficient.
Jay spent the entire evening looking. He checked every box twice. He moved furniture. He searched through drawers. But his apartment wasn't that big. If it wasn't there, it was gone.
The trash got collected Mondays. Even if he wanted to go search his trash bags, it was too late.
He sat down on the floor with his head in his hands and cried for a long time, allowing the misery to consume him. The sobs were ugly and harsh, his whole body shaking with them.
Eventually he dragged himself to the shower, still crying. The water mixed with tears. He cried himself to sleep for the second time in a week, and slept poorly, waking repeatedly from formless nightmares.
Wednesday morning, he went to work feeling more defeated than ever. The metro ride was dreary. His reflection in the dark windows looked haggard.
It was obvious to him now that he couldn't go on like this anymore. The apartment was a stupid idea. This work had been a mistake.
He was happy to have met Ian. Just weeks ago he’d stood beside him in a kitchen full of light and cinnamon. Now every word he’d said then sounded ridiculous—like someone pretending to be worthy of that warmth. He still treasured the memories they'd shared, but it all felt so distant, like it had happened in another life. To a different person who'd been braver and more capable. 
He couldn't stay here. Ian couldn't shield him from himself. He shouldn't need to. Someone like Jay would only drag Ian down.
The oppressive gloom of the winter weather made his spirit heavier. During a quieter moment, Jay stepped outside to make a phone call. The agent answered on the second ring.
"I need to cancel the apartment purchase. A sudden money situation emerged. I can't move forward right now."
The agent was quiet for a moment. "I see. That's unfortunate. If the situation improves, please call me. I'll keep the property on hold for you for now."
"Thank you."
Jay hung up and looked at his watch. The gift from Ian, beautiful and expensive. He didn't deserve it. He didn't deserve the apartment or this work or security. His place was at a gas station in a rough neighbourhood. At least there, no one expected anything from him. There was no one to disappoint.
Ian could see that Jay looked even worse today than yesterday. The concern was becoming difficult to ignore. He didn't want to be overbearing, but he also wanted to help. The last time Jay had made a mistake, his bad mood had lifted eventually. But this time seemed different. Worse, somehow.
Thursday wasn't better. Neither was Friday morning. At six on Friday evening, Ian finally decided to intervene. He called Jay to his office. Jay entered and stood near the door, not meeting Ian's eyes.
"Sit down, please," Ian said gently.
Jay sat.
"I wanted to check in with you. I know this period is difficult. The strain gets to everyone, but I've noticed you seem particularly affected. Is there anything I can do to help?"
Jay didn't speak for a long moment. Then he shook his head. Just once, a tiny motion that conveyed nothing.
"Jay, talk to me. What's going on?"
"I'm fine. Just tired."
"You don't look fine."
"I'll manage."
Ian tried a different approach. "Everyone makes mistakes. The table incident was resolved. It's not something you need to keep thinking about."
"I know."
But Jay's didn't believe it. His shoulders were hunched, his hands clasped tightly in his lap. He didn't look like someone who'd made a mistake at work. He looked like someone who'd given up on himself.
Ian felt helpless. "If you need time off—"
"I don't need time off. May I go back to my desk?"
"Of course. But my door is always open if you want to talk."
Jay nodded and left without another word.
Ian watched him go, worry knotting his stomach. Something was badly wrong, and he didn't know how to help. He didn't know how to reach Jay when he'd withdrawn so completely.
Jay sat at his desk and forced himself not to cry. Ian had to coddle him like a child, handle him carefully so he wouldn't fall apart. Some assistant he was. More like dead weight.
The office felt suffocating. Jay pulled up a spreadsheet and stared at it without seeing anything. 
Around him, his teammates worked. Ela was on a phone call. Kim typed rapidly. All of them competent. All of them managing the pressure without falling apart. All of them stronger than Jay would ever be. He didn't belong here. He'd known it from the beginning, really. The joke hire. And somehow he'd convinced himself otherwise, convinced himself he could do this. 
The day dragged on. Jay stayed until nine, same as everyone else. When he finally left, the relief of escaping was undercut by the knowledge that he'd have to come back Monday and do it all again.
He took the metro home, walked up to his apartment, and stood in the doorway looking at his packed boxes.
A life ready to be abandoned. The only question was where he'd go next.
Scene 5
Faith
Jay forced himself to go to the gym Saturday morning. He almost didn't. Leaving his apartment and facing other people was overwhelming. 
Rus took one look at him and frowned. "You look terrible."
"Thanks."
"I'm serious. When's the last time you slept properly?"
Jay couldn't remember. "I sleep fine."
"Right. You want to talk about it?"
"Nothing to talk about."
"Jay—"
"I'm fine. Let's just work out."
Jay's performance was worse than Tuesday. He struggled with weights that should have been easy. Halfway through, Rus stopped him.
"That's enough. You're going to hurt yourself."
"I can finish."
"No. You can't. Whatever's going on at that job, it's destroying you."
"I know."
"Do you? Because from where I'm standing, you're just letting it happen."
Jay wanted to argue but couldn't find the energy. Rus was right. He was letting it happen. Letting everything slip away—his health, his confidence, his safety nets. All of it sliding through his fingers like water.
"I'll figure it out," Jay said finally.
"When? After you collapse? After you end up in hospital?"
"It's not that bad."
"Isn't it?"
Jay left without answering.
The next two weeks were filled with self-pity. On the surface, he functioned. But anyone paying attention could see the difference.
Luc cornered him in the kitchen during a rare lunch break. "Hey. You doing okay?"
"Fine."
"You don't look fine."
"Just tired. We're all tired."
"Yeah, but... You seem different. Like something's really wrong."
"It's just the workload. I'll be fine once strategy season ends."
"Will you? Because it seems like more than that."
Jay smiled, a thin approximation of his normal cheerfulness. "I appreciate the concern, but really. I'm managing."
Luc didn't look convinced but let it drop.
At the gym, Rus was less diplomatic. "You're still wallowing."
"I'm not wallowing."
"You are. And it's painful to watch. Whatever happened, you need to either fix it or move on."
"It's not that simple."
"Staying like this isn't helping anyone, especially not yourself."
Jay knew Rus was right, but knowing didn't change anything. He felt trapped in amber—everything around him moving forward while he remained suspended, unable to break free.
Ian tried to intervene several times. Brief conversations in his office, diplomatically phrased questions about workload and wellbeing. But Jay deflected every attempt.
"I'm fine."
"Are you sure? You seem—"
"Just focused on work. There's a lot to do."
"If you need anything—"
"I know where to find you. Thank you."
Ian sat alone in his office late one evening after Jay had left, the lighter Jay gave him for Christmas resting in his palm. The engraved message mocked him: "You've got this."
Did he? Because it didn't feel like he had anything under control. Jay was slipping away, and Ian couldn't stop it.
They'd been so close already. Moments when Ian had felt truly connected to him. And now it felt like they'd taken five steps back—back to when Jay first started, when he'd learned about being a joke hire and closed himself off completely.
Ian turned the lighter over in his fingers. What could he do to solve this? Jay had seemed to have complete faith in him once. But now that faith seemed insufficient to keep him here.
The nightmare still haunted Ian. Jay bleeding out on marble floors, dying in his arms. And then there was the evening after the gala. The slip of his tongue, calling Jay beautiful. Had that been too much? A blunder that created an obstacle where there have been none? Ian replayed the moment constantly, trying to read Jay's reaction, but memory was unreliable and tainted by his own fear.
The obstacles kept multiplying. Work stress, mistakes, whatever personal crisis Jay was experiencing. And Ian felt powerless against all of it.
As days passed, the workload remained too heavy to really address anything properly. Ian worked fourteen-hour days at the office, then came home and worked more. Dusk till dawn, strategy documents and financial projections consuming every waking moment.
He couldn't abandon his duties to check on Jay, no matter how much he wanted to. He couldn't take an afternoon off to sit on Jay's small couch and drink and talk about what was actually wrong. The work demanded everything.
It was his fault the workload was this heavy. His decisions as CFO that led to this intensity, this pressure that crushed everyone beneath it. Jay was stressed and clearly taking the situation poorly, and Ian couldn't blame him. He could only blame himself.
Late Sunday night, Ian stood at his window looking out over the city. The lights stretched endlessly, thousands of windows with thousands of lives playing out behind them. Somewhere out there was Jay's apartment. Was Jay sleeping? Or was he awake like Ian, trapped in his own spiral?
Ian wanted to call. To text. To do something that bridged the distance between them. But what could he say? He'd already tried talking, offered help that Jay refused. Pushing harder would only drive Jay further away.
So Ian did nothing. Stood at his window and felt helpless, the lighter growing warm in his closed fist.
Ian went to the office on Monday early. Jay arrived exactly on time. They exchanged greetings, discussed the day's priorities and got consumed by work.
But it wasn't the same. Jay moved through the motions, and Ian watched him with growing dread.
Because this felt like the beginning of an ending. Like watching something precious slip through his fingers, unable to hold on no matter how tightly he tried to grasp it.
The office felt cold. The winter light through the windows was harsh and unforgiving. Strategy season would end eventually, but Ian was no longer certain what would remain when it did.
Jay worked at his desk, head down, focused on his screen. Ian could see him through the glass wall, close enough to call out to but impossibly distant.
