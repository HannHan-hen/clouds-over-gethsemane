Chapter 36: Foolish fantasies
Scene 1
Ray Shore
May arrived with gentle warmth and clear skies. The endless rain finally stopped. Trees bloomed in full force, painting the streets in white and pink. Jay walked to the metro each morning through the park near his apartment, listening to birds sing in the branches overhead. The air smelled fresh and green. Everything felt new.
He stopped one morning to watch sunlight filter through the blossoms. A month ago he'd been huddled against the rain, miserable and lost. Now he stood in his new neighbourhood, on his way to a job he'd chosen to keep, with a home that was actually his. The difference was staggering.
On Monday morning, Ian called a team meeting before the work began. Everyone gathered in the conference room looking curious.
"I wanted to give you advance notice. We're bringing on a new senior analyst today. His name is Ray Shore. He's a former classmate of mine and exceptionally skilled at analysis."
Amy looked pleased. "That's excellent news."
"There's something you should know beforehand. Ray is brilliant, but his personality can be difficult. He's blunt. He has no social graces whatsoever. He may come across as rude."
The team exchanged glances.
"How rude are we talking?" Kim asked.
"Not malicious. Just direct to the point of being uncomfortable. He doesn't engage in pleasantries or small talk. He has no interest in office politics or relationship building."
"Sounds delightful," Luc muttered.
"I can vouch for his character. He's not cruel or unkind. He simply doesn't see the point of social conventions. Try not to take it personally."
"We'll manage," Max said. "If you trust him, that's enough for us."
"As long as he pulls his weight, I don't care if he never says hello," Kim added.
"That's the attitude I'm hoping for. Give him space to work his way. He'll demonstrate his value quickly."
Ray Shore arrived at nine thirty. He was tall and solidly built, with shoulder-length black hair that looked hastily combed. His suit fit properly but somehow still managed to appear rumpled. His expression was almost bored. He would have been handsome if he'd shown any animation at all.
Ian met him at the door. "Ray. Good to see you."
"Ian." Ray's tone was flat.
"Let me show you around."
Ian introduced Ray to the team one by one. Ray made no attempt at conversation. He didn't smile. He barely looked at anyone directly. When Ian finished the introductions, Ray immediately claimed the desk furthest from everyone else.
Kim brought over his new equipment. Ray took it without a word of thanks and started setting everything up. Within minutes he was clicking through files, completely absorbed.
At noon, the team headed out for lunch at a nearby seafood restaurant. Ray remained typing at his desk.
"Should we invite him?" Zoe asked.
"I don't think he'll come. But someone should ask," Max said.
Luc walked over. "We're heading to lunch. Want to join us?"
Ray didn't look up from his screen. "No."
"Alright. See you later."
Ray said nothing. Luc returned and they left together.
At the restaurant, Ela ordered a shrimp dish and smiled broadly. "The weather is finally perfect. I've been waiting for this."
"The new hire is certainly interesting," Amy said.
"He's quiet," Luc said. "I'll give him that."
"If Ian brought him personally, he must be exceptional," Max said. "We'll just have to get used to his quirks."
Kim stabbed at his fish. "As long as he's competent, I don't care if he never speaks to us. Honestly, it might be refreshing."
Ela laughed. "You're terrible. But I agree. If he's as good as Ian says, maybe our overtime sessions will finally end."
Everyone perked up at that thought.
"That would be incredible," Zoe said.
"I'll happily tolerate any personality if it means reasonable hours," Luc said.
They ate their meals in better spirits. The sunshine streaming through the windows helped with the mood.
In the afternoon, Ray spent three hours in Ian's office. The door remained unlocked. Jay could hear every word from his desk.
Ray's questions were detailed and relentless. He demanded specifics about every aspect of their methodology, their data sources, their analysis frameworks. He challenged assumptions. He pointed out potential weaknesses. He showed absolutely no deference to Ian's position.
"That model is outdated," Ray said at one point.
"It serves our purposes," Ian replied.
"Barely. You should update it."
"We've considered that."
"Then why haven't you?"
"Resource allocation."
"That's a poor excuse."
Ian answered everything patiently. Jay was both impressed and slightly terrified. He'd never heard anyone speak to Ian so bluntly.
Finally Ray closed his notebook. "That covers the immediate concerns. I'll begin the portfolio analysis tomorrow."
"Thank you. Let me know if you need anything else."
Ray left the office without further comment. He returned to his desk, made some notes, then shut down his computer. At exactly four o'clock he picked up his bag and walked out.
Luc stared after him. "Did he just leave at four on his first day?"
"Apparently," Kim said.
"Bold."
The rest of the team began departing around five. Jay stayed longer. He had correspondence to finish and several reports to format. The office slowly emptied until only he and Ian remained. At six, Jay walked to Ian's office. Ian was reviewing documents, but looked up immediately.
"Yes?"
"I just wanted to ask about Ray."
"What would you like to know?"
"You mentioned you were classmates. Were you close?"
"Not particularly. We were civil, but not friends."
"What was he like back then?"
"Brilliant. Uncompromising. He was there on a full scholarship, top of the class in every subject that mattered. He had no patience for the social aspects of university life."
"Was he always this blunt?"
"Always. Most students from wealthy families found him insufferable. He made no effort to network or build relationships. He treated professors and fellow students with equal indifference."
Jay tried to imagine Ian in that environment. Ian, who must have been one of those wealthy students. "Did that cause problems?"
"Constantly. He made many enemies. People who could have helped his career later. He didn't care."
"Why not?"
"I don't think career advancement interested him. He studied because he enjoyed it, not because he wanted status or wealth. After graduation his employment history was erratic. Brilliant performance followed by sudden departures."
"Because of his personality?"
"Partially. He refused to participate in office politics. When management made decisions he considered stupid, he said so. Directly. That doesn't tend to lead to promotion."
Someone who valued competence over everything else, who couldn't be bothered with games or social niceties. It explained the bare-bones interactions today.
"Do you think he'll fit here?" Jay asked.
"I do. This team is full of people who care more about results than appearances. Amy, Max, Luc, all of them. They'll appreciate his abilities once they see them. And Ray will appreciate working somewhere that doesn't punish him for being himself."
"You really trust him."
"I trust his competence absolutely. And I know he's not malicious. Difficult, yes. Unpleasant, sometimes. But not cruel."
"Thank you for explaining," Jay said.
"Of course. If you have concerns about working with him, let me know."
"I don't have concerns. Just curiosity."
"That's understandable."
Jay returned to his desk and worked for another hour before heading home. On the metro, he thought about what Ian had said. Ray had been there at university with Ian. He'd seen Ian during those years when Ian was still one of the rich kids, before everything fell apart.
What had Ian been like then? More carefree, probably. Before all the wounds that shaped him into the man he was now. Before all the pain that carved him into someone so contained.
Jay wanted to know. He wanted to understand every part of Ian's history, every piece that made him who he was.
He wanted to ask Ray about it, but it was obvious Ray wasn't someone who would answer that kind of question. He barely spoke at all, let alone about personal matters.
Jay got off at his stop and walked through the park toward home. The evening was warm and pleasant. Birds still sang in the trees. The light was golden and soft.
He thought about Ian sitting in a university classroom, surrounded by wealthy peers, while Ray sat somewhere nearby, glaring at everyone with contempt. The image made him smile.
He unlocked his apartment and stepped inside. The space still felt new and wonderful. He made dinner, ate on the balcony, watched the river turn dark as the sun set.
His life was good. Better than it had any right to be. This was his home now. His space. And somehow, Ian was woven through all of it. His neighbour, his boss, his friend. The person Jay couldn't stop thinking about, no matter how hard he tried.
Scene 2
Work-life balance
The next morning Ray arrived at exactly eight o'clock. He said nothing to anyone, claimed his desk, put on headphones, and began working. His fingers moved across the keyboard, pausing occasionally. Otherwise he was motionless.
At noon, Luc approached his desk again. Ray pulled off one side of his headphones.
"Lunch?" Luc asked.
"No."
"You sure? We're trying a new place today."
"I'm sure. Stop asking. I won't join your lunch outings. Or any other outings."
"Fair enough. What about the company retreat later this month?"  
"Under no circumstances would I join a company retreat."  
"Got it. Message received."
Ray put his headphones back on. Luc returned to the group and they headed out together. At the restaurant, Luc recounted the conversation with obvious amusement.
"He told me to stop asking. Just like that."
"At least he's clear about his boundaries," Amy said.
"I couldn't help myself. I asked if he'd at least come to the company retreat this month."
"You didn't," Zoe said.
"I did. He looked offended. Said under no circumstances would he attend a company retreat."
Max laughed. "I can respect that level of commitment to solitude."
"It'll take some getting used to. But I suppose we just won't talk to him at all," Ela said.
"Seems that way. I'm fine with it," Kim said.
They ate their meals in good spirits. Ray's peculiarities were becoming a great source of entertainment.
Back at the office, the afternoon passed quietly. At five, most of the team began packing up. Jay remained at his desk, working through correspondence.
Ian appeared beside him. "No gym today?"
"Not today. The commute is too long now. Going all the way across the city twice in one evening isn't ideal."
"What will you do instead?"
"I'll still go on Saturdays. And I'm thinking about working out at home. I have the space now, and some equipment. Maybe I'll try running too. The area seems good for it."
"There are excellent routes near the river. I run there sometimes."
"Could you recommend some?"
"Of course. The path along the south bank is about five kilometres. There's also a loop through the park that's shorter but has more hills. I'll write them down for you."
"Thank you."
The rest of the week followed the same pattern. Ray arrived at eight and left at four. He ate lunch at his desk, leaving only for coffee and the bathroom. Occasionally he went to Ian's office for clarification, but otherwise worked independently. He seemed to be conducting an audit of their entire methodology, checking historical data and reviewing old models.
On Thursday, Ray sat next to Max for an hour. Jay couldn't help overhearing.
"Walk me through your portfolios," Ray said.
"What specifically do you want to know?"
"Everything. Start with your initial assessment."
Max explained. Ray asked follow-up questions. They were nuanced and detailed. Jay understood maybe half of what they discussed. The technical depth was beyond him.
Friday morning, Ray repeated the process with Amy. He sat beside her desk and worked through her portfolio management decisions from the past year. Amy responded with the same patience Max had shown, explaining her reasoning and providing documentation when requested.
In the afternoon, Ray went to Ian's office with a folder of notes. Jay could hear them through the open door.
"I've completed the initial assessment," Ray said.
"What did you find?"
"The core methodology is sound. There are inconsistencies in documentation and some classification delays, but nothing that compromises the analysis quality. I have recommendations for improvement."
"I'd like to hear them."
"Your sector rotation model needs updating."
"I'm aware."
"When are you planning to address it?"
"Next quarter."
"That's too late. You should prioritize it."
They discussed timelines, methodologies, implementation strategies. Ian gave Ray specific direction on which models to update and how to approach them. Ray took detailed notes.
When Ray returned to his desk, he typed frantically for the rest of the afternoon. At four o'clock exactly, he stood up and left.
Luc called after him cheerfully. "Have a great weekend, Ray!"
Ray didn't acknowledge him. The door closed.
Luc turned to Kim with a grin. "I'm going to keep doing that."
"Why?" Kim asked.
"It's funny."
The office gradually emptied. Jay stayed, as he had every evening that week. The backlog was mostly cleared now, but he was reluctant to leave early. He told himself it was to stay on top of correspondence, but really he just preferred being here while Ian was here.
At six, everyone else had gone. Ian emerged from his office and walked to Jay's desk.
"What are your impressions of Ray?" Ian asked.
Jay looked up. "I'm not sure yet. He's definitely a personality."
"That's diplomatic."
"We'll only know if he's a good match once he actually starts producing work. For now, he seems to believe strongly in work-life balance."
Ian laughed. "That's one way to put it. Ray refuses to work overtime. He expects to receive his contractual pay for his contractual hours, and not a second longer."
"That's unusual in finance."
"Very unusual. If there's too much workload, he considers that a management issue, not his problem."
"I can see how that wouldn't make him popular."
"I don't disagree with his philosophy. My own workaholism is unhealthy. The frequent overtime during busy periods is unreasonable. Perhaps having someone like Ray will help us improve."
"Maybe."
Ian leaned against the edge of Jay's desk. "I wanted to ask you something. Next week we're holding the final round of interviews for junior analyst positions. I'd like you to join me."
Jay stared at him. "Join you for interviews?"
"Yes."
"I don't have any hiring experience."
"I'll send you the CVs on Monday to review. These candidates will be doing many of the tasks you currently handle, so it seems reasonable to involve you in the selection."
"What tasks?"
"Printing, proofreading, basic formatting, document organization. The office-wide administrative work. You're supposed to be my personal assistant, not assist the entire department. Having dedicated junior staff will let you focus on more important responsibilities."
Jay felt his stomach twist. "I don't mind the administrative work."
"I know you don't. But it's not the best use of your abilities. This way the senior analysts can work more efficiently without constantly pulling you away from your primary duties."
"I see."
"We'll discuss it more next week. I just wanted to give you advance notice."
"Thank you."
Ian returned to his office. Jay sat at his desk, staring at his computer screen. Junior analysts to handle administrative work. Work that he did now. Work that made him useful to everyone, not just Ian.
He'd always been the junior before. The new hire. The inexperienced one. Now apparently he was senior enough to help hire people beneath him.
He packed his bag at seven and said goodbye to Ian. The ride home felt strange. At his apartment he ate dinner while his mind was elsewhere. On Saturday he took the metro across the city to his old gym. Rus greeted him at the entrance.
"You actually came back," Rus said.
"I said I would."
Halfway through the workout, Jay brought up the junior analyst situation.
"It's weird. I'm supposed to help interview them."
"Why is that weird?"
"I've never hired anyone. I don't know what I'm doing."
Rus laughed. "You're thirty, Jay. Almost thirty-one. This is natural progression."
"I don't feel ready."
"Nobody ever feels ready. You'll figure it out."
"What if I make a mistake?"
"Then you'll learn from it. Stop overthinking."
Jay completed his set in silence. Rus watched him with amusement.
"Before you know it, you'll be a director," Rus said.
Jay sent him a look. Rus burst out laughing and patted his back.
"Relax. You're doing fine."
At home that evening, Jay thought about what Rus had said. He was thirty years old. He'd been working at Turner & Associates for almost two years. He had his own apartment now, a permanent contract, a senior title. Of course he wasn't a junior anymore.
New life, new responsibilities. That was how it worked.
He went to his bookshelf and pulled out the leadership textbooks he'd bought months ago when he wanted to better understand Ian's work. He'd never read them properly, just skimmed through sections here and there.
Now he sat down and started from the beginning. Recruitment techniques, interview strategies, candidate evaluation. He read through Saturday evening and all day Sunday, absorbing as much as he could.
He wasn't going to make hiring decisions. Ian would do that. But he at least wanted to understand the theoretical framework. He wanted to be useful, not just present. By Sunday evening he'd filled a notebook with observations and questions. He felt slightly more prepared, though still uncertain.
Everything was changing. His responsibilities, his role, his understanding of where he fit in the company. He just had to keep moving forward, even when he didn't feel ready.
Scene 3
Interviews
During their morning briefing, Ian handed him a stack of files. Jay felt deeply uncertain. 
"These are the CVs for this week's candidates. Twenty in total. I wanted to give you some context before we begin. What we're looking for, what to watch for."
"Alright."
"All of these candidates are qualified on paper. They have the degrees, the grades, the technical knowledge. That's not what we need to evaluate."
"Then what do we evaluate?"
"Whether they'll be a good match for this team. This industry attracts sharks. People who are ruthless, calculating, willing to do anything to advance. I'm allergic to that sort of person."
Jay thought about his own hiring, about Leo's scheme, about how Ian had been burned before. "I understand."
"I don't expect saints. But I want people who aren't mercenary about life. People who care about more than just advancement and money."
"How do we tell the difference?"
"That's the difficult part. Everyone will try to make a good impression. We need to look past that impression and try to gauge how they actually operate. Kindness can be indistinguishable from manipulation. Bluntness is easier to trust than calculated charm. But the nastiest people are often the best at hiding behind a pleasant facade."
"That sounds impossible."
"It's challenging. Very few people are like Ray, who show their hand immediately and never hide who they truly are."
Jay opened the first folder. The CV inside was impressive. Prestigious university, excellent grades, internships at major firms. "These credentials are all better than mine."
"Credentials don't determine success here. Character does."
"I don't feel qualified to judge that."
"You will. Trust your instincts. Pay attention to how people present themselves, what they choose to emphasize, how they respond to unexpected questions. The interviews start at four this afternoon."
Jay spent day hour reviewing the CVs. Each one was more impressive than the last. Top universities, honours programs, relevant experience. He made notes on each, but his observations felt inadequate. He couldn't tell who would actually be good at the job.
At four o'clock, Ian collected him from his desk. "Ready?"
"Not really."
"You'll do fine."
They walked to a small conference room near the lobby. Jay recognized it immediately. This was where his own interview had taken place two years ago. He'd been terrified then, awed that he was even allowed inside this building. Now he sat on the opposite side of the table. The reversal felt surreal.
A woman from HR joined them. She was middle-aged, elegantly dressed, holding a tablet and several folders. Jay knew her name was Lea, but they never spoke before.
"Shall we begin?" Lea said.
The first candidate arrived at four. A young man, wearing a perfectly tailored suit. He confidently shook hands with everyone.
Ian gestured to the seat across from them. "Please, make yourself comfortable. Would you like water, coffee, tea?"
"Water would be great, thank you."
Jay poured water from the pitcher on the table and passed it across. The candidate thanked him with a bright smile.
Lea began with the standard questions. Background, education, previous experience. The candidate answered smoothly.
Ian took over with more specific questions. "Tell me about a time when you disagreed with a decision your supervisor made. How did you handle it?"
"At my previous internship, my supervisor wanted to use a particular risk assessment model that I felt was inappropriate for the client's portfolio structure. I prepared an alternative analysis and presented it privately. We discussed the merits of both approaches, and ultimately she decided to use a hybrid method incorporating elements of my suggestion."
"How did that make you feel?"
"I appreciated that she was willing to consider alternative viewpoints."
Jay wrote in his notebook: seems confident, answers well prepared.
The interview continued for twenty minutes. When the candidate left, Lea made notes on her tablet.
"Initial impressions?" Ian asked.
"Very polished. Perhaps too polished," Lea said.
"I agree," Ian said. "Jay?"
"He seemed nervous despite the confident delivery. His hands were shaking slightly when he drank the water."
"Good observation."
They saw three more candidates that afternoon. Each interview was similar. Jay took notes on each one, recording small details. One candidate talked too much. Another made consistent eye contact but never smiled.
By six they were finished. Four candidates, two hours total including discussion time. In Ian's office afterwards, Jay reviewed his notes. He'd written observations next to each name. Seems nervous. Talks excessively. Very composed. Self-assured, maybe too much.
"What are your impressions overall?" Ian asked.
Jay looked up. "Honestly? I have no idea who's best. The talkative one seemed the most competent, but also excessively self-assured. Apart from that, they all seemed very similar."
"I had the same impression. It's the first day, though. We'll see more variety as the week continues."
"Do you already have preferences?"
"I'm especially wary of people who appear too charming. I can't have that on my team."
Ian was completely serious, and Jay understood exactly where that reservation came from. He suspected he'd kept his own job partially because of how uncharming he'd been, but he didn't say that aloud.
Four candidates arrived each afternoon starting at four o'clock for the rest of the week. Jay had developed his own evaluation system. He paid attention to how they spoke about their previous workplaces, how they answered questions about failure, what they emphasized about themselves.
On Wednesday at five-thirty, a young woman entered the conference room. She wore glasses and old-fashioned bangs, dressed in a conservative suit that didn't quite fit properly. Her handshake was gentle.
"Thank you for this opportunity," she said.
Lea began the standard questions. The woman never rushed her answers.
"Why did you choose finance?" Ian asked.
"Family pressure, mostly. My parents both work in banking. They expected me to follow. I've done well enough in the coursework, but I've always struggled to fit in with the culture."
"What aspect of the culture?"
"The competitiveness. The aggression. Everyone seems to be fighting for position constantly. I find it exhausting."
"What are you looking for instead?"
"Somewhere I can do good work without politics. Somewhere that values competence over showmanship."
Jay wrote: modest, honest, struggling to fit in. He felt instant recognition. Not due to family pressure, but the difficulty fitting into a world that felt foreign.
Ian asked several more questions. The woman answered thoughtfully, occasionally mentioning her family or her pets. Jay marked her as his first choice.
On Thursday afternoon, one candidate made a dry joke that Jay found particularly funny. He had an awkward delivery and seemed uncomfortable with formal interview settings. Jay marked him as his second choice, though he recognized humour was probably a poor criterion.
On Friday came a woman in her thirties with short hair and a no-nonsense demeanour. Her CV showed military service followed by a career change.
"Why did you leave the military?" Ian asked.
"Incompatible work philosophies. I disagreed with command decisions that I felt prioritized optics over effectiveness. I was told to follow orders without question. That didn't work for me."
"So you chose finance?"
"More or less at random. I needed a second career. I finished my degree while working security jobs, then found positions at several firms. It turned out I was good at analysis."
She stood out among the younger candidates with more prestigious backgrounds. Jay marked her as his third choice. Her unusual path reminded him of his own indirect journey to this office.
By Friday afternoon they'd completed all twenty interviews. Ian and Jay gathered in Ian's office for the final discussion. 
Ian turned to Jay. "What do you think?"
"Three choices. The woman from Wednesday at five-thirty, the awkward man from Thursday afternoon, and the former military woman from today."
"Interesting selections. Why those three?"
"The first one was honest about struggling with the industry culture. The second had a sense of humour. The third had an unusual background and seemed uninterested in playing games."
"I selected the nervous man from Monday and the quiet woman from Tuesday. But my third choice would also be the former military candidate. The first two seemed harmless. Non-threatening. People who would do their work without causing problems."
Jay thought that was certainly a criterion, though a depressing one.
Ian continued. "But I've been thinking about my approach. I've been selecting based on who seems safest, least likely to cause trouble. That's defensive hiring."
"Is that wrong?"
"It's limiting. You selected based on who showed actual personality. That's probably a better strategy."
"You're the one with experience."
"And you're the one who works with everyone daily. You understand team dynamics better than I do. We'll hire your top two choices."
Jay felt panic spike immediately. "What if I'm wrong?"
"They're junior positions. It's common for new hires to quit within the first month. If they're not a good match, they'll leave and we'll try again."
"But—"
"I trust your judgement. Your observations throughout the week have been sound. Your instincts are good. You saw things I missed. Have more faith in yourself."
Jay stared at his notebook, face burning. "I just don't want to make a mistake."
"You won't. And if something goes wrong, it's my responsibility, not yours. I'm making the final decision. I simply happen to agree with your assessment."
"Alright."
"Lea will contact the selected candidates on Monday. They'll start in two weeks if they accept."
The meeting ended. Jay returned to his desk in a daze. Ian trusted him. Trusted his judgement enough to hire based on his recommendations. That should have felt good. It did feel good. But it also felt insufficient. As if the praise only highlighted something missing. Some gap between what Ian was willing to give and what Jay wanted to receive.
He packed his bag at seven and took the metro home. The whole journey he felt his face burning, Ian's words replaying in his mind. At his apartment, sat on the balcony despite the cool evening air, watching the river and thinking about Ian's confidence in him.
Why did it make him feel both happy and profoundly sad? He wanted this acknowledgement. He'd worked hard for it. But receiving it felt like looking across a distance he didn't know how to cross.
He went to bed early, and sleep brought dreams immediately. 
Jay dreamed about sitting across from Ian, about being valued and understood. He dreamed about things he couldn't let himself want while awake. When he woke Saturday morning, he felt hollowed out. The dreams had been vivid enough to feel real, leaving reality disappointing by comparison.
He made coffee and sat on the balcony wrapped in the burgundy blanket. The river flowed past, indifferent to his confusion. Somewhere twelve minutes away, Ian was probably awake too, following his strict schedule, living his controlled life.
Jay wondered if Ian ever thought about him outside of work. If he ever felt this ache of wanting something more than what they had. Probably not. Ian had been through too much to risk anything. And Jay was just his assistant.
Scene 4
Intrusive thoughts
Jay took the metro across the city to his old gym. Rus was warming up on the rowing machine.
"You're here early," Rus said.
"Couldn't sleep."
Jay moved to the weights, but his mind was elsewhere.
"Something wrong?" Rus asked.
"Ian made me choose the new hires."
"That's good, isn't it?"
"It feels like too much responsibility. What if I picked wrong?"
"You're overthinking this. Your boss trusts you. That's a positive thing."
"I just don't want to mess up."
"You won't. And if something goes wrong, that's not on you anyway. This is a good opportunity. You're finally living up to your potential."
"Maybe."
"Maybe nothing. I was worried about you staying at that job, but it seems like it was the right call after all. You're doing well."
"I suppose."
Near the end of his workout, Jay mentioned the gym search.
"I'm thinking of finding a place closer to home."
Rus sighed theatrically. "I'm surprised you still come here at all. You practically live on the Heights now."
"The Heights are much farther north," Jay grumbled.
"Sure they are. But seriously, I'm happy for you. You look better. You're thriving. The move and promotion seem to have taken your mind off that unrequited love situation at least."
Jay turned sheepish immediately. Love. The word had started to sound like a curse.
"Right," he said quietly.
Rus clapped him on the shoulder. "Keep your head up. Things are looking good."
After the gym, Jay spent the afternoon walking through his neighbourhood looking for alternatives. Every gym he found was aggressively upscale. Sleek equipment, pristine floors, staff in designer athletic wear. Everything looked expensive and fragile. He missed the rough atmosphere of his old gym, where nobody cared if you dropped weights or sweated on the machines.
He left each one feeling more disheartened. He didn't want to worry about breaking equipment or looking out of place.
In the late afternoon, he called his landlord to terminate his lease. The company dealt with rentals near the old town. To Jay's surprise, they wanted to meet next Wednesday to finalize everything.
"You have a three month notice period," the woman explained. "But the area is sought after. We'll find a new tenant quickly. Better to handle it now."
"Wednesday works fine."
Jay hung up feeling dazed. That was much faster than he expected. In the afternoon he called his mother.
"Jay! How are you?"
"Good. I wanted to tell you about the new apartment."
"Tell me everything!"
He described the space, the balcony, the neighbourhood. His mother made delighted sounds throughout.
"We have to visit. The children are already talking about it."
Jay heard his siblings chattering excitedly in the background.
"You're all welcome. Maybe in July? After my busy period at work ends."
"That's your birthday. We absolutely must have a party."
"It's a small apartment. Not really built for parties."
"Nonsense. We'll make it work. We absolutely must celebrate properly."
Tim's voice came through the phone, slightly muffled. "Tell Jay about my birthday!"
His mother laughed. "Your brother is turning eighteen in autumn. You have to come for that party."
"That's right in the middle of our busy season. I can't promise anything."
"You have to try."
"I'll do my best. And I'll send a proper gift regardless."
"You better," Tim said.
"Send photos of your new place!" Ema shouted from somewhere nearby.
"I will."
After the call ended, Jay spent an hour photographing his apartment. He captured the balcony view, the kitchen, the bedroom, the living space. Then he took pictures of the neighbourhood, the river path, the parks. Even his mediocre photography skills couldn't hide how charming everything was.
He sent the photos to his family group chat. Responses came immediately.
"It's beautiful!"
"You live THERE now??"
"The river view is incredible"
"When can we visit???"
Jay smiled at his phone. The enthusiasm was warming, even if it made him feel slightly fraudulent. This life still didn't feel entirely real.
But even the busy day couldn't distract him from thoughts of Ian. As evening approached, Jay filled the bathtub. The hot water relaxed his muscles but did nothing for his thoughts. He imagined what it would be like to be held by Ian. Would it be warm? Comforting?
He thought about the brief embrace they'd shared months ago. Jay hungover and vulnerable, Ian broken and honest, both of them desperate for comfort. He remembered Ian's firm frame, that deep lovely scent.
Jay closed his eyes. He knew he couldn't think these things, but his mind betrayed him anyway.
After the bath he went to bed feeling stupid. Nothing good would come from such foolish fantasies. Ian was his boss, his mentor, his friend. Someone who'd shown him extraordinary kindness and trust. These thoughts were inappropriate and pointless.
Jay wandered restlessly on Sunday. He explored the neighbourhood thoroughly, checking parks he hadn't visited yet, walking past gyms that were farther away and all equally unsuitable. He found a charming pier further north and sat watching the river for an hour, trying not to think about anything at all.
He didn't want to sit alone in his apartment with his thoughts. That felt dangerous.
Monday at work felt oddly normal. Work meant structure, purpose. Ray arrived at eight and disappeared into his headphones. The rest of the team went about their business. Jay focused on his tasks.
At six, after everyone else had gone, Jay walked to Ian's office. Ian looked up from his computer.
"Do you need something?"
"I wanted to ask about gym recommendations in the neighbourhood. The ones I found are all very upscale."
It was a legitimate question. But mostly he wanted a pretext to talk to Ian, to be near him.
"Ah. I'm probably not the best person to ask. I mostly work out at home. My trainer comes on Saturdays to monitor my form."
"You have a home gym?"
"Yes. It seemed practical."
"That makes sense."
"During summer I also swim laps in the pool at my apartment complex. The outdoor one."
The image hit Jay suddenly. The memory of Ian's tanned body from last year's company retreat pool party. Broad shoulders cutting through water. Wet hair. Droplets on skin.
Jay's face burned.
"I need to go," Jay said abruptly.
"Is something wrong?"
"Stomachache. I should head home."
"Do you need—"
"No. I'm fine. Sorry. See you tomorrow."
Jay fled before Ian could say anything else. He grabbed his bag and left the office, not looking back. He heard Ian say something else but didn't catch the words.
On the metro, he buried his face in his hands. What was wrong with him? It was a disproportionate reaction. Completely foolish. Ian would think he was insane.
At home, Jay collapsed on the couch and stared at the ceiling. He couldn't let his weird thoughts make their relationship awkward. He had to control himself better, but his mind kept wandering to inappropriate places, imagining things that would never happen, wanting things he had no right to want.
He went to bed early, determined to sleep away the confusion. Tomorrow he'd be normal. He'd stop reacting like an idiot every time Ian said something perfectly ordinary.
But as he lay in the dark, wrapped in the burgundy blanket, Jay couldn't stop himself from imagining that warmth. He couldn't stop himself from wishing for something more than what he had, even as he knew that wishing was pointless.
He fell asleep eventually, exhausted from fighting his own thoughts. His dreams were full of water and sunlight and someone just out of reach, no matter how far he swam.
Scene 5
Rescue
On Tuesday, Jay tried to compose himself better. When Ian appeared at his desk at nine, concern was evident on his face.
"How are you feeling?"
"Much better. I must have eaten something wrong yesterday."
"Are you certain?"
"Completely certain. It passed quickly."
Ian accepted this explanation, though reluctance showed in his expression. "Good. I'm glad you're alright."
"Was there something you needed?"
"Yes, actually. Both candidates accepted our offer. They'll start in June, along with the second senior analyst."
Jay smiled, though it felt strained. "That's wonderful."
"Are you sure you're feeling better? You look tired."
"I'm fine. Really."
"If you need anything, let me know."
"I will. Thank you."
Ian returned to his office. Jay turned back to his computer, relieved. Two weeks until the new hires arrived. Normally he'd be anxious about the change, about training new people and adjusting dynamics. But right now he was glad for the distraction from his troubling thoughts.
Ray had already grown into his place. He became a silent monolith at the far desk. Occasionally he consulted team members, but his interactions were always brief and strictly work-related. Jay still hadn't spoken to him once. Jay's administrative duties were completely outside Ray's scope of interest.
By Wednesday, the topic around the office was the upcoming retreat. They'd depart Thursday afternoon for three days at the resort.
Ian tried to convince Ray to attend.
"It would be good for team cohesion," Ian said.
"No," Ray replied without looking up from his screen.
"The location is quite nice."
"No."
"You wouldn't have to participate in activities."
"No."
Ian accepted the refusal with good humor. "Understood. We'll see you Monday then."
Ray returned to his work without further comment.
Jay watched the exchange with amusement. Ian and Ray's interactions were unlike anything he'd seen before. Ray's brusqueness would have seemed rude with anyone else, but Ian  never took offense or pushed too hard.
That evening Jay returned home and pulled out his largest suitcase, the one Ian had given him during their international trip. He opened it on his bed and began packing.
His clothes from last year's retreat were still perfectly appropriate. He selected two of his three-piece suits for any formal occasions. Resort wear for the evenings, newly bought casual clothes, gym clothes for hiking. Everything fit easily with room to spare.
This time he felt no anxiety about packing. Last year he'd worried constantly about having the right things, about fitting in, about making mistakes. Now he knew that with Ian there, he had nothing to worry about.
Apart from his own unreasonable thoughts.
But surely those were just a passing anomaly. He knew himself. He'd never been one to entertain idle fantasies, not in his whole almost thirty-one years of life. This wouldn't be an exception.
He closed the suitcase and set it by the door, ready for Thursday.
Ian sat in his apartment Wednesday evening, reviewing retreat arrangements on his tablet. Everything was confirmed. Transportation, accommodations, activity schedules. All the logistics were handled.
But his mind kept returning to Monday. Jay's sudden departure, the unconvincing excuse about a stomachache. The way he'd looked flushed and uncomfortable before fleeing.
Ian hoped he hadn't pushed too hard with the recruitment responsibilities. He'd really believed Jay's instincts were sound, that involving him was the right choice, but maybe it had been too much pressure.
He wanted the new hires to work out specifically because of Jay. He wanted them to take over Jay's more tedious duties so Jay would have more time. More time to spend with him.
Ian had been bitter about the missed opportunities over the past year. All those evenings they should have been spending together in the lounge, but instead were drowning in unreasonable workload. All those moments stolen by busy seasons and overtime and constant demands.
He used to like his busy evenings. He'd arranged his entire life to ensure his evenings were full of work. He'd needed the distraction, needed something to fill the empty hours.
But now work was hindering him. And he'd worked hard to remedy that.
Recruiting Ray had been a calculated move. Ray had been working remotely for some obscure company on the New Continent after his last position ended spectacularly badly. Ian had sent Leo to track him down, intercept him, convince him to accept the job.
Leo had found him in a cramped apartment, working for minimal pay, and probably miserable despite his perpetual indifference.
"Never," Ray had said immediately when Leo explained the situation.
"Just hear me out," Leo had said.
"I don't do office politics."
"Ian knows that. He's offering you peace. Nobody will bother you. Regular hours, engaging work, good pay. You'll be left alone to do what you do best."
Ray had been skeptical. But Leo was persuasive, and eventually Ian had gotten on a call himself to make guarantees.
"You'll work your contracted hours and leave," Ian had said. "No expectations beyond competence. No social obligations. No games."
"Why would you want someone like me?"
"Because you're brilliant and reliable. That's more valuable than someone charming who causes problems."
It had taken three conversations before Ray agreed. But Ian had been certain it would be worth it. Ray's intellect was razor-sharp, better than Ian's own in many ways. He'd easily handle the heaviest workload from the senior analysts, freeing up everyone's time.
The second senior analyst had been hired through the standard process. She had excellent credentials, extensive experience, and impeccable references. Ian had been reluctant to authorize her hire anyway, his instincts warning against anyone too polished. But his integrity had won. She was objectively the best candidate among those he'd deemed acceptable.
At least she was happily married with three children. Ian didn't expect drama from that quarter.
The junior hires were wild cards. But juniors were easier to replace if something went wrong. They didn't need to be perfect, just acceptable enough to reduce workload and free up the evenings.
His evenings with Jay.
The retreat was just two days away now. Three whole days in close proximity to Jay. Breakfast and dinner, evening conversations, shared activities. Ian would make sure Jay was happy and comfortable, that he enjoyed every moment.
He wished they could share a room again as they had on the last retreat. But they'd have the second-best thing. Meals together, long talks, the boat trip where they'd be on the same small boat.
Ian had reviewed the activity details extensively. Six people per boat, which meant he and Jay would share with four others. Not ideal, but better than being separated. They'd have at least those few hours together on the water.
He'd make sure the retreat was special. That Jay had a good time, felt included and valued. That was what mattered.
Ian walked to his window. Twelve minutes south, Jay was probably packing, preparing for the same trip. Maybe sitting on his balcony, watching the same river that flowed past Ian's building.
So close. Yet the distance between them felt impossible to cross.
Ian had grown expert at suppressing his feelings, at maintaining perfect control. But lately that control felt fragile. Every smile from Jay threatened to crack it. Every shared evening made it harder to maintain the necessary distance.
Three days at the retreat. Ian would have to be careful. Attentive but not obvious. Helpful but not overbearing. He'd perfected this balance over the past year, but it never got easier.
