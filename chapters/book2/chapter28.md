Chapter 28: Unusually warm autumn
Scene 1
Practical considerations
Both Jay and Ian arrived at the office shortly before eight, having slept in slightly to recover from their eventful weekend. They threw themselves into the demands of the day, only briefly acknowledging their shared time together, though there was a closeness to their interactions now, as if they’d known each other for years.
"You still look groggy," Ian observed during their morning briefing.
"I had trouble getting up. The weekend took more out of me than expected. How's your back? That couch can't have been comfortable."
"I've slept in worse places. Though I admit I was glad to be back in my own bed."
During his morning coffee break in the kitchen, Jay found Luc already there, wearing a contrite expression.
"You're lucky my jacket was saved. Otherwise I would have been very cross with you," Jay said with mock solemnity.
"I'm still mortified about how that went. Gav feels absolutely awful about Yan's behaviour and wants to make it up to you somehow. If we'd known he was going to be such a complete ass, we never would have brought him."
"He seemed a bit arrogant, but I didn't expect him to be so unpleasant."
"He can be at times, but it's never quite that bad. Gav is furious because he actually had high hopes about the evening, and Yan effectively ruined his chances with all three women. He's still moping about it."
"What happened after I left?"
"Gav was relieved you weren't interested in dating, made his own chances better, you know? But Yan monopolized all the women's attention and was insufferable on top of it. Unforgivable, really."
"No real harm done. Though I'm never agreeing to another blind date arrangement. I don't want to kill the vibe with my funeral director smile."
Luc laughed. "Don't listen to Yan. Though in retrospect, you did look a bit... intimidating. No wonder the women were too shy to approach you."
Jay was surprised. This was news to him—he'd been called many things in his life, but never that. "Intimidating?"
"Maybe Ian's rubbing off on you," Luc added with a grin.
"What about Ana? How did things work out with her?"
"We'll see how it goes. I'm not sure I want anything serious right now. Happy just dating around, keeping things casual."
"That's probably wise."
"But seriously, Gav is determined to organize some kind of apology event. He feels responsible for the fiasco."
"That's completely unnecessary. I just want to forget the whole thing happened."
Luc adopted a tragic expression. "Gav will never live this down if you don't let him make amends. He's actually considering moving out of the apartment from shame."
"Now you're just emotionally blackmailing me."
"Is it working?"
"Absolutely not."
"What if we made it fun? Invited your gym friends, found something everyone would enjoy?"
Jay narrowed his eyes suspiciously. "Are you trying to poach my trainer?"
"You saw right through my elaborate plot."
Jay fled the kitchen before Luc could extract any commitments, leaving his colleague laughing behind him.
After lunch, Jay called the real estate agent Ian had recommended. He was immediately accommodating, listening to Jay's requirements and budget constraints.
"I think I can show you several excellent options that might not have appeared in your previous searches. Different neighbourhoods, some properties that are just coming on the market. When would be convenient for viewings?"
They arranged to meet Friday afternoon, giving him time to compile a selection of suitable apartments.
That evening, Jay stayed late at the office, joining Ian for their renewed tradition of afternoon coffee in the kitchen. After a week of apartment hunting that had kept him away from the office each evening, it felt comforting to return to the overtime work.
"I'm afraid I'm starting to be more like you. Finding solace in working late."
Ian laughed. "That's an awful development."
"At least the place is pleasant. After a whole week of visiting properties, it feels nice to take it easy here."
"How did the call with the real estate agent go?"
"He seemed very helpful. We're meeting Friday afternoon to look at several places. And Luc filled me in on the weekend aftermath—apparently Gav is still angry about Yan's behavior."
Ian was content hearing that Jay's tormentor had faced some consequences, however minor, and that the weekend's drama had resolved without lasting damage. "I'm glad things worked out reasonably well in the end." 
"Luc said I looked intimidating at the restaurant. Do I really come across that way?"
"Not at all. But you definitely appear far more confident than you did a year ago."
"Is that good or bad?"
"Entirely good. You've grown into yourself. It's obvious to everyone around you."
They chatted about various work matters for a while before going back to their respective desks.
Jay returned home around nine that evening, spending the remainder of his time browsing online for relaxing weekend activities. Nothing particularly caught his attention—most suggestions seemed either too elaborate or too mundane for what he had in mind.
He still had several days to plan something appropriate for Ian's forced day of rest. The challenge was finding activities that would engage someone who seemed to find fulfilment primarily through productive work. He wanted to choose something Ian would enjoy, not just endure out of politeness. The pressure to make it perfect was probably excessive, but Jay was unable to approach the task casually.
As he scrolled through various entertainment options, Jay pondered on Ian's observation about his increased confidence. Looking back at his early days at the company, he could see the point. The anxious, uncertain person who had started working for Ian bore little resemblance to the man who now felt comfortable enough to insert himself into his boss's weekend plans. 
Perhaps that change really did make all the difference in how others perceived him. Whether it was sustainable or advisable remained to be seen, but Jay was no longer particularly concerned about such practical considerations.
Scene 2
Great social transgression
The next day Jay left work at five to head to the gym. Throughout the day, Luc had been casting him pointed glances, but thankfully hadn't pressed the issue of his promised apology for the unfortunate evening.
This time, Ian wasn't even melancholy about Jay's early departure. "Have a good session," he said cheerfully. He was sustained by the vision of their weekend together, and the anticipation made the early departure tolerable, if barely.
At the gym, Rus immediately pounced on him for details.
"So how did the date go? You look like you survived it at least."
Jay made a point of complaining about it for the entire session. "The man insulted me repeatedly, calling me a funeral director. The women completely ignored me. The drinks were awful, the pub was impossibly loud, and my best suit got ruined when someone spilled wine all over it."
"That sounds terrible."
"It was. Then I got stupidly drunk trying to salvage what was left of the evening and had such a terrible hangover I almost missed work the next day. I told you I didn't want to go."
He didn't mention a word about Ian, knowing Rus disapproved, but dramatized every detail to emphasize that he had been right not to want to go.
Rus got the message clearly. "I'm sorry I pushed you into it. How about we do something fun next weekend to make up for it?"
Jay laughed. "Luc already made the same suggestion, but no thanks. I've already made plans, and these plans definitely don't involve getting humiliated."
"Plans? What kind of plans?"
"The kind that don't involve blind dates," Jay replied, deflecting with a smile.
Rus pressed for more details, but Jay remained mysteriously silent about his weekend arrangements.
When he returned home, Jay realized he had not only made weekend plans with his boss, but he was being secretive about it. He felt it was important that absolutely no one could know, as if he was committing some great social transgression. He suspected that a subordinate fraternizing with his boss to this extent could be seen as problematic.
The secrecy should have been alarming, but instead it felt thrilling. The sensation was so unlike anything he had ever experienced that it gave him a momentary pause, but he quickly dismissed his concerns. There was no point in overthinking any of it. For once in his life, it was a moment to act, not analyse.
After three hours of browsing websites and reading reviews, he threw up his hands in frustration and decided to abandon his quest for the perfect itinerary. Instead, he would simply take Ian to do things Jay himself enjoyed. 
A scenic ferry ride along the river, where they could watch the city drift by from the water. A visit to a restaurant that served seasonal dishes for a lunch made from fresh pumpkins. Then the botanical garden he loved, where the autumn trees had turned deep red and gold, creating a spectacular display just before the leaves fell completely.
The plan felt right, personal. He just hoped the weather would cooperate, because otherwise their outdoor activities could quickly turn cold and gloomy.
He went to sleep pleased with his decision, even ecstatic. As he drifted off, he thought it was going to be perfect. A lovely autumn date with Ian. Wait. Not a date. Just an outing.
But the thought of it being a date made his heart race unexpectedly, and he fell asleep smiling at his own foolishness for entertaining such ideas.
The next day at work, Luc approached Jay conspiratorially.
"There's this amazing bar with a fantastic entertainment show this weekend. Perfect atmosphere, great drinks, very peaceful. What do you say?"
"I already have plans that absolutely cannot be changed," Jay replied.
Luc looked sceptical. "You never have plans. Do these plans involve the gym and industry reading?"
"I made arrangements with friends already, and I'm not going to change them. Tell Gav he doesn't need to blame himself or fret about Saturday night. It's forgotten."
"Friends? What friends?"
"Friends who make plans that don't require apologizing afterwards."
From his office, Ian had been listening to this exchange with glee. Jay was defending their weekend plans against social pressure, prioritizing their time together over other opportunities. The joy that made him feel was probably disproportionate to the circumstances, but he was unable to care.
Wednesday and Thursday, Jay worked late with Ian, sharing their daily coffee conversations in the kitchen and leaving together around eight. Both were in rather good moods, laughing at each other's jokes and seeming to find everything more amusing than usual.
On Friday, Jay had his meeting with the agent and left at five. Ian was so excited about the weekend that he left home early as well, because staying at work felt unbearable.
Jay met the agent in the city centre next to a property. He was a short, cheerful fellow in an elegant suit with an exaggerated smile. He drove Jay around in his expensive sedan, showing about ten different apartments and handing Jay a folder containing specifications with photos and floor plans of each place, clearly meticulously prepared.
The apartments were a bit over Jay's budget and, while nice, not quite nice enough to justify the price. But Jay still studied all the listings and added his own notes. He told the agent which ones he liked and why.
In the last place they visited, they had a conversation about Jay's ideal apartment.
"I'd love a good view and a balcony, but well designed floor plan and good transit access are most important. I'd like plenty of storage space and a bathroom that can fit a washing machine. I value functionality, but I'd like the space to feel welcoming."
The agent was extremely enthusiastic about this information, even suspiciously so. They arranged to meet the following week for another set of places that would take into account everything Jay had said.
Jay selected three he liked the most and added them to his list. The neighbourhoods were a bit too posh for his tastes, but the apartments themselves were acceptable.
As he rode the metro home, his thoughts quickly moved away from housing logistics. Tomorrow he would go to Ian's apartment. The prospect overwhelmed every other consideration.
Scene 3
Weekend work
Jay dealt with all the most pressing chores on Friday evening, doing laundry and cleaning his apartment. On Saturday morning, he finished the remaining tasks before heading to the gym. He was unusually energetic, which didn't escape Rus's notice.
"You're practically bouncing off the walls. Do your mysterious plans involve an actual date?"
Jay couldn't suppress a giggle. "No, definitely no date whatsoever."
This response only cemented Rus's suspicion, but he dropped the subject. Jay left the gym in high spirits and showered very thoroughly before dressing in one of his standard office suits and taking a taxi to the address Ian had given him.
Really, a day working with his boss in his free time should not be something he looked forward to this much, and yet here he was.
When he arrived, Jay evaluated the neighbourhood. It was definitely upscale, but not as upscale as he had imagined. He had thought Ian would live in one of the most prestigious districts of the city, but the area was closer to the financial district than to the exclusive Heights where old money resided. Perhaps practical considerations took precedence. The district was by the river and had plenty of green spaces though, so Jay approved.
At precisely noon, as arranged, Jay rang Ian's bell. Ian's voice came through the intercom immediately, as if he had been waiting nearby.
"Come up. Twentieth floor."
Ian met him at the apartment door, immaculately dressed as always. Jay had wondered if Ian might wear something more casual at home, but of course not. He probably didn't even own casual clothes.
Ian's penthouse was on one of the top floors of the building, with a large living room overlooking the city and a separate kitchen. 
"Coffee?" Ian asked after they exchanged their customary greetings.
Jay nodded, setting up a workspace at the dining table and unpacking his laptop. He noticed the painting on the wall—the same one he had admired at the company art exhibition they had attended together. It brought back pleasant memories.
"I remember that painting. From the art show," Jay said when Ian returned with coffee.
"I thought it would liven up the space."
Ian already had his computer set up at the opposite end of the table, and soon they went to work. Ian showed Jay what he was working on—mostly technical tasks involving spreadsheet templates and data organization. They divided the work and started tackling it, chatting occasionally about casual topics.
It was the first time they had worked so closely together. While Jay normally sat outside Ian's office in fairly close proximity, they had always been divided by a glass wall. Now they could see each other easily whenever either looked up, and could talk without having to raise their voices.
For Jay, sitting in Ian's personal space like this made his skin tingle. He stole glances around the apartment and at Ian when he moved from one section to another, breathing in the scent of something fresh—maybe apple and spice. Probably an air freshener, but subtle enough that it was barely noticeable.
After an hour, Ian announced, "I'll make lunch."
Jay wanted to protest but just nodded. "Do you need any help?"
"I'll be done in a few minutes."
Jay got up and stretched, savouring the opportunity to move freely through Ian's living space. Eating Ian's homemade food felt almost decadent. Their shared breakfast had been divine, and Jay's anticipation was considerable.
Ian returned within ten minutes with two plates of pasta with mushrooms and herbs. "I prepared everything beforehand and just had to cook it quickly. Various pastas with seasonal ingredients are my go-to meals when I cook for myself."
Jay ate with delight, and of course it was delicious. He offered to clean up, but Ian waved him off.
"My housekeeper comes daily and takes care of whatever needs attention."
"Even on Sundays?"
"Yes. May is an older lady who's been with me for years. She finishes the work in at most two hours on most days, and since she's my full-time employee without other work, she insists on ensuring the house is spotless at all times."
Jay thought it was nice that Ian had someone taking care of him, and he wasn't surprised that people who worked for Ian were so fiercely loyal.
They returned to work afterwards, and Jay focused properly to accomplish as much as possible. He was no stranger to tedious and repetitive tasks, and had plenty of experience working weekends since starting at Turner & Associates. He was making excellent progress.
"You don't need to go quite so hard at it. It's not urgent," Ian commented.
Jay insisted, "I need to ensure you have nothing on your mind tomorrow, so as much of this needs to be finished today as possible. Preferably all of it."
Ian smiled to himself. "Alright then, let's do our best."
After another hour, Jay asked if they should have more coffee, and Ian agreed. Jay followed him to the kitchen, which was bigger than expected and quite well-stocked for someone who didn't cook regularly.
"May rotates the selection and brings whatever gets uneaten home, so nothing goes to waste. The produce often reflects her tastes. I'm sometimes in the mood for something different from my standard meal plan, and I cook occasionally to maintain the skill."
"I doubt cooking is like violin playing. It doesn't atrophy that much."
"I'm not entirely sure about that. Plus it's relaxing to do something different occasionally. The uneaten meal containers get delivered to the community kitchen by May the next day, so I don't worry about waste."
Jay approved of the sustainability. "That's thoughtful."
"My experience of finding myself one day with absolutely nothing was eye-opening about the value of charity and avoiding waste."
Ian prepared coffee using a high-end but relatively standard machine. Jay evaluated the setup with an appraiser's eye. "I should think about getting a coffee machine for my new apartment."
"Absolutely. Having space for conveniences should be one of your priorities. There's no reason for you to suffer discomfort—you've had enough of that already."
They returned to work, and Ian brought out a fresh fruit platter with sliced varieties that were quite diverse, courtesy of May.
"She was quite happy I'm having visitors. It doesn't happen very often."
"She'd be less happy if she knew it's just a coworker doing literal weekend overtime."
"May claims it's important to eat lots of fruits, and a big variety. I don't disagree. Cut fruits appear in my diet frequently."
As time passed, they took more frequent breaks, talking about food and housing. Soon eight o'clock arrived, and Ian announced the end of the workday.
"We accomplished quite a bit," Jay agreed.
"Let me take you to dinner. It's the least I can do," Ian proposed.
Ian drove them to a nearby restaurant he frequented. He recommended the steak, which Jay ordered, while Ian chose grilled salmon.
"Steak is an occasional indulgence. I save it for business dinners. I need all the help I can get to survive them."
"You don't seem like someone who has problems with the social demands of your job."
"There's a good reason Leo handles most client relations. I can manage them when necessary, and do it well, but it's not exactly my favourite activity. I much prefer the comfort of being alone with numbers."
Jay pondered this for a moment. "Did my company today distract you from your numbers?"
"Not at all. I never realized what help a skilled assistant could be until I met you. After the Sam Connelly situation, I was certain assistants of any sort were only a liability."
Jay was hesitant, but curiousity won and he asked, "Was Sam a good assistant?"
Ian laughed, though without much humour. "Not remotely. Back then I thought he was, but that was due to my inexperience. He spent most of his time distracting me from work that needed to be done. At the time, that felt... exciting. But I was simply foolish."
Jay didn't want the evening to turn sombre by revisiting old wounds, but he was secretly pleased that Ian opened up to him like this. Ian seemed to recognize the sensitive territory and quickly changed the subject.
"Since we're mostly finished with the main course, shall we look at desserts?"
Jay winced. "You seemed so health-conscious twenty minutes ago while ordering, and now you want desserts?"
Ian laughed. "I like desserts, but let's go for their roasted fruits with honey. They're excellent and not too unhealthy."
They did, and Jay agreed they were delicious.
"I prefer the fruity and nutty options," Ian said.
Jay made a mental note—this seemed like important information.
Ian then drove Jay home, and as Jay left the car, he said, "See you tomorrow. I'll pick you up at eleven. We're taking public transport, so brace yourself."
"Sounds fine. I'll be ready."
They parted ways, both pleased with how the day had gone.
Scene 4
Sunday date
Jay dressed that morning in one of his best suits—and the boldest of his selection, the tailored burgundy three-piece that made him look like old world royalty. He selected a black tie with subtle but striking patterns, combed his hair to perfection, and regretted that he had never researched cologne. His dress watch was the only jewellery he wore, and he looked at it with warmth—the gift from Ian, matching his outfit perfectly. Tie pins or cufflinks would have completed the look, but he was too inexperienced with men's fashion to add such touches.
Still, he was reasonably satisfied with the effect. He looked good.
He took a taxi to Ian's building and arrived five minutes early to find Ian already waiting near the entrance. Jay stepped out to collect him, and they rode together to the ferry port.
The weather was perfect. November chill was in the air, but it was sunny enough that no coats were needed, and Jay felt relieved.
"I'm eternally grateful we have nice autumns. I'd hate it if the weather ruined my plans," Jay remarked as they rode.
"What exactly are these mysterious plans?"
"Nothing too exciting, so don't get your hopes up. Mostly boat rides and walks in public gardens."
"At least my forced time off is leisurely. I was half-worried you'd drag me to a fencing session."
Jay laughed. "You're completely safe. No strenuous physical activity planned. It's a rest from your gym regimen as well."
They reached the river port quickly thanks to light weekend traffic. Jay led the way to a large ferry with a small cafe on the upper deck. They made themselves comfortable, and Jay explained it was a two-hour ride upstream through the more industrial part of the city. They ordered coffees and soon the boat departed.
"Have you ever taken the scenic ferry ride?" Jay asked.
"No, I haven't. I was born in this city and have lived here most of my life, but it never occurred to me. It wasn't an activity people did in my circles, and I never deviated from expectations."
"I'm sorry if it's too plebeian, but I love it. I took it my first year after moving to the city and several times afterwards. The gentle rocking is relaxing and the views are quite nice. The city looks different from this perspective, and the parts by the river are the best-maintained areas. It probably makes me a country bumpkin for still being impressed after so many years, but I can't help it."
"It's quite charming," Ian said, watching the autumn scenery drift past. "The fall colors really are lovely."
They chatted about their pastimes. Jay told Ian about his first several boat rides, though most had been solitary and unremarkable. Ian shared stories from his youth.
"Besides violin and fencing, I enjoyed tennis. I also rode horses, though it wasn't my favorite. Nothing wrong with it, I just wasn't a horse person. We went skiing as a family, but I haven't done that in years. I still play tennis regularly, and I'm quite fond of swimming. My apartment complex has an outdoor pool that I use frequently in summer."
Time passed quickly with conversation and sightseeing, and they soon reached their destination. The restaurant Jay had chosen was not far, and they walked through charming streets.
It was a bistro with a large outdoor patio decorated for the season, with apples and pumpkins arranged in rustic baskets. They ordered seasonal classics: thick pumpkin soup with freshly baked garlic bread, pickled pumpkins, baked potatoes, and pumpkin pie for dessert. The meal was hearty but fresh, and a bonfire in the backyard brought nostalgic scents to Jay.
"We used to have bonfires like this regularly when I was growing up. Very popular in my part of the country. There's something magical about the smell of burning leaves and wood."
The atmosphere was pastoral, and Jay thought they stood out from the local crowd in their elegant suits, but he didn't mind at all.
After lunch, Jay led them to the metro and they traveled several stops to a botanical garden. Jay guided Ian through the paths, showing him his favorite spots. There was a refreshment stand in the center where Jay bought them caramelized apples on sticks, then led Ian to a secluded bench by a small pond.
"You'll need to eat carefully to avoid staining your suit," Jay warned, then retrieved a bag of seeds from his jacket. He handed half to Ian with instructions on duck feeding.
"You want me to feed ducks?" Ian asked, looking bemused.
"Naturally. It's a perfectly respectable Sunday afternoon activity," Jay replied with a deadpan expression,  demonstrating the proper seed-scattering technique.
Ian imitated him, and they watched ducks flock to the food, quacking enthusiastically.
"I do this regularly. Low cost, pleasant hobby. I always make a point of feeding the ducks at least once during vacation time. Since I don't really travel, I've made it my mission to find local activities that can be done on a budget. Duck feeding ranks quite high on that list. What did you do for fun during your studio years?"
"Nothing," Ian replied simply.
"You couldn't have done absolutely nothing."
"I never allowed myself time off. Only work, gym, occasionally tennis if I felt generous. I played violin too, but only after several years when I finally bought an instrument. By then my skill had degraded massively."
Jay felt heartbroken hearing this, and the urge to embrace Ian again overwhelmed him. But without his previous hangover-induced bravado, he lacked the courage.
Jay looked at the early setting sun, golden light making the red leaves even deeper in color. "Well, those days are over. For as long as I'm your assistant, I'll make it my mission to ensure you take proper breaks and enjoy life. Even if I have to force, trick, or manipulate you into it."
Ian laughed at Jay's solemn expression. "You're free to try, but I should warn you—I'm pretty stubborn."
They sat feeding ducks until darkness and chill set in, then Jay proposed dinner. They took the subway toward Jay's neighborhood—a rather long ride, but Sunday trains were fairly empty so they sat comfortably.
"Are you uncomfortable with so much subway time?" Jay asked.
"Not at all. I'm quite acquainted with the transit system. It feels a bit nostalgic. I don't miss living in that studio, but the experience wasn't entirely negative. Character-building, eye-opening, humbling in constructive ways. I grew up very sheltered with narrow perspectives. The circumstances that expanded my worldview were harrowing, but the growth itself was valuable."
Jay was struck by Ian's mature perspective. Truly the mark of a great man—to lose everything and still see the silver lining.
Jay chose a restaurant he knew well, more rustic and folk-oriented than Ian's usual establishments, but Jay found it charming. He recommended cabbage rolls.
"My grandmother used to make them just like these," he said.
Ian had never eaten anything similar. It wasn't bad—definitely an interesting experience.
When evening fell for good, Ian thanked Jay for the day. "This was definitely novel. I'll take a taxi home from here."
"I hope it wasn't too disappointing."
"Not at all."
Jay felt slightly sheepish, suspecting this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity unlikely to repeat. But even so, he was glad he had convinced Ian to stop working, if only for one day, even if it was just to feed ducks.
He walked home through the cold evening air, thinking he would treasure this moment—the day he convinced his distinguished boss to ride ferries and walk through parks with him.
Yet when he returned home, Jay felt profoundly sad. At Ian's isolation, at getting only this small glimpse of him as a person before they returned to their respective roles. He lay in bed, overwhelmed by melancholy, as if something precious had been taken from him.
Scene 5
Gloom
The next Monday was unusually heavy for Jay. Nothing was really wrong, and he worked beside Ian all day, seeing him from dawn until dusk. But it felt different. There was a glass wall between them now, both literal and metaphorical. They were not friends, certainly not anything more than that. They were coworkers, brought together by circumstances and held in place by the thin context of their working arrangements.
It felt suffocating somehow.
For one brief Sunday afternoon, they had sat as equals sharing mundane experiences that had felt extraordinary. Jay knew it was an illusion, but it had been so beautiful he couldn't bring himself to let it go.
During their afternoon coffee, Ian asked, "Is anything wrong? You seem quiet today."
"It's nothing. Just realizing that autumn is ending, making me feel nostalgic."
Jay didn't know how to voice what was bothering him without sounding greedy and ungrateful. He also didn't want to burden this wonderful man with his foolish feelings.
They worked long hours that day, until nine, then until ten, neither moving from their desks despite barely accomplishing anything meaningful. Both felt untethered, reluctant to part ways but unwilling to say it aloud. Finally it became unfeasible to prolong the evening further, and they left, barely looking at each other, as if afraid of what they might see in each other's eyes.
Jay completely abandoned dinner that day. They hadn't ordered anything, he had nothing prepared at home, it was late, and frankly he wasn't that hungry. He just showered and went straight to bed.
The next day was Tuesday, so Jay left at five to go to the gym, leaving Ian alone in his office. Ian took it unusually hard. His one weekend alone with Jay was over, and it had been amazing, but now it was in the past and Ian had nothing more to sustain him. Nothing to hope for, nothing to wait for. Just the reality of watching Jay leave for other arrangements involving other people, friends and companions who occupied the spaces in Jay's life that Ian could never claim.
And Ian had nothing. Just the dull ache in his chest and the knowledge that this was as much as he would ever get. The scraps of attention from his assistant who was too kind for his own good, who had taken pity on his pathetic boss and arranged entertainment because it was too sad to watch him work constantly.
Ian accomplished nothing that evening. He simply sat in his office, brooding.
At the gym, Jay was distracted and sighing frequently.
"Was the date a failure?" Rus asked.
"It wasn't a date, and no, it was wonderful," Jay replied, then sighed deeply. "Rus, have you ever met someone so perfect you knew you'd never be able to measure up to them?"
Rus laughed. "Ah, so you got rejected. Look, you're a great guy, and whoever turned you down is blind and doesn't understand what they had."
Jay shook his head and decided against trying to untangle this misunderstanding. "You don't understand."
"Don't worry. You'll meet someone even better."
"I seriously doubt it."
"How about we plan something fun for this weekend? Cheer you up, get you back out there."
"Yeah, I don't want to sit at home alone and overthink."
"I'll let you know what we're doing. Reserve Saturday afternoon."
Jay just nodded and sighed again, this time even more deeply.
He returned home feeling foolish. Rus had gotten a completely wrong idea, and his melancholy was for an entirely different reason. It was just that Ian was exceptional, and Jay was blessed to be able to stay close to him. But at the same time, he knew he couldn't be farther away from him, and it felt painful.
He should have made dinner, but once again he didn't feel like it. He just sat on his couch and sighed, then took a really long shower and went to bed early.
On Wednesday morning he felt groggy and sluggish. Skipping dinner two consecutive nights was reckless and foolish. He had promised himself to take better care of himself, to not disappoint Ian, to stand by his side no matter what. He couldn't allow his confusion to impact his well-being.
He ate double breakfast and that same day booked his seasonal vaccination that he had been planning to get. During lunch, he ordered an unusually large portion.
"Someone's hungry today," Amy observed as Jay attacked his meal.
"I was too lazy to cook and skipped dinner, so I need to make up for it," Jay explained to general team amusement.
"You're looking gloomy these days," Luc observed. "Are you still upset about that evening? Because if so, Gav is still hoping to organize an apology event, maybe this weekend."
"I have plans."
"You're lying. There's no way you're having plans two weekends in a row."
"It's with Rus this time."
Luc looked offended. "You'll make plans with your gym trainer but not with your favourite coworker?"
Jay managed a weak smile. "Maybe some other time."
Jay stayed late that day again, tackling non-urgent issues. The next day he had another apartment viewing, so he was going to leave at a normal hour and wanted to avoid any backlog.
There was a slight undercurrent of tension between him and Ian that went unacknowledged but was deeply felt. Last week had been joyous, but now very little of that joy remained, and they were both subdued. They both blamed it on the weather—as November slowly ended, nice days were few and far between, with temperatures reaching ten degrees, gloomy skies, and darkness falling early.
Both were aware it was deeper than weather for them, even though neither realized the other was taking it equally poorly. They exchanged strained smiles as they returned to their desks to finish the workday.
This time they left at eight, and Jay finally cooked dinner and ate, but it tasted like nothing at all. He hoped he wasn't catching some illness.
The weight in his chest remained, a constant ache he couldn't understand. He only knew that something precious felt just out of reach, and the distance between what was and what could never be seemed to grow larger with each passing day.
