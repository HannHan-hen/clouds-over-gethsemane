Chapter 39: Facing the truth
Scene 1
Workflow disruptions
July began and quarterly reports descended on them like a storm. People arrived early and left late. Coffee consumption tripled. The printer ran constantly.
It was a chaotic period. Not only were reports being compiled, but the new senior analysts needed training. Liv and Ray shadowed the team, observing procedures, asking questions, learning the systems.
But both learned fast and didn't obstruct the workflow. Liv took meticulous notes and knew when to step back. Ray watched silently, absorbing everything, never interrupting. It went better than planned.
Luc took Rin under his wing and showed him the ropes. "You're basically a glorified printer for the next week. Print things, organize documents, fetch coffee. Don't ask complicated questions during crunch time."
"Got it. Be useful, be invisible."
"Exactly."
Rin understood the assignment perfectly. He made himself small, printing reports, sorting files, running errands. When he had questions, he saved them for quieter moments.
Zoe wanted to take Gal under her wing the same way, but Gal kept fleeing to Jay instead.
"Jay, how do I format this section?"
"Follow the template."
"But I'm not sure if—"
"Gal, I'm in the middle of something. Ask Zoe."
"I already did. I wanted your opinion."
Everyone exchanged looks. Kim shook his head slightly.
Ray, true to form, didn't stay a second longer than his normal hours. He arrived at eight, working tirelessly during those eight hours, but the moment four o'clock came, he was gone.
Liv stayed a bit longer but also left around six. "I have to pick up my boys. But I'll be back early tomorrow."
The new senior analysts didn't actually do any work yet. They observed, made notes, asked questions. They weren't needed beyond learning, so they left at normal hours. Rin felt the atmosphere correctly and adapted. He left at five or six, understanding that his inexperience would only slow things down.
But Gal was ambitious. She insisted on staying late, hovering near Jay's desk with questions while everyone scrambled on a tight schedule.
"Jay, should I include the quarterly variance analysis or just the annual?"
"Gal, I told you—follow the template."
"But I want to make sure I'm learning correctly."
"You're learning by watching. Not by interrupting."
She looked hurt. But ten minutes later, she was back.
"Jay, about the client retention metrics—"
Amy's voice was sharp. "Gal. He's busy. We're all busy. Save your questions for later."
"Oh. Sorry."
She retreated to her desk but didn't leave. She sat there, ostensibly working on practice documents, but really just watching Jay.
An hour later, Ian's door opened. He stepped out, scanned the office, and his attention fixed on Gal's desk.
"Gal. My office, please."
Jay watched through the glass wall. Ian's expression was calm. Gal sat across from him, nodding. The conversation lasted five minutes.
When Gal emerged, she was pouting. She packed her things and left without saying goodbye.
Jay felt a wave of relief. At least one burden less. He was eternally thankful for Ian's intervention.
That evening, after everyone else had left, Jay went to Ian's office.
"Thank you for talking to her," Jay said.
"She was disrupting the workflow."
"I know. But I didn't know how to say it without being harsh."
"That's my job. You focus on the reports. Let me handle personnel issues."
"What did you tell her?"
"That her enthusiasm is appreciated but her timing is poor. That the best way to learn during reporting season is to observe and ask questions afterwards. That staying late when she's not contributing is not helpful."
"How did she take it?"
"She understood. She may not like it, but she understood."
Jay sat down in the chair across from Ian's desk. They were alone in the office now. The city was dark outside the windows.
"How are you holding up?" Ian asked.
"Tired. But fine."
"You're managing everything well."
"I have practice now."
"You're doing excellent work."
Jay felt warmth in his chest. "Thank you."
Jay didn't want to leave. It was late and he was exhausted, but sitting here with Ian felt like the only peaceful moment in days.
"We should go home," Ian said gently.
Ian drove Jay home every night. It became expected. Neither of them questioned it.
On Thursday night, they sat in the car outside Jay's building. Too tired to move immediately.
"The worst will be next week. Final reviews and client presentations."
"I know."
They sat in silence for a moment. The building windows glowed with warm light.
"I should go," Jay said. "Get some sleep."
"Yes. Goodnight."
"Goodnight, Ian."
Jay got out of the car. Ian watched him enter the building before driving away.
They worked on Saturday as well. The old guard worked twelve-hour days, six days a week. They arrived at eight and left at eight, sometimes later.
The second week was more intense. Final reviews, corrections, submissions. Everyone worked frantically to meet the deadline.
Liv and Ray helped with the final review, double-checking the correctness of calculations and formatting.
"This variance calculation is wrong," Ray said, pointing at Amy's screen.
"Where?"
"Here. You divided by the wrong quarter."
Amy groaned. "You're right. Thank you."
Liv caught a formatting inconsistency in Max's report. "The headers don't match the template."
"I thought we updated the template."
"We did. But this file is using the old version."
"I'll fix it."
By Tuesday evening, everything was nearly complete. One more day of review and they'd be finished.
Gal sat at her desk, working on training exercises Zoe had given her. She'd stopped approaching Jay. She left at five every day without comment. Her enthusiasm had been replaced by resignation.
Jay felt guilty but also relieved. He didn't have time to manage her feelings right now.
Ian drove Jay home one last time. They'd return to normal hours tomorrow. Jay was disappointed. He'd gotten used to these evening drives.
"Thank you for driving me all week. It was very kind."
"It was practical. We're neighbors."
"Still. I appreciated it."
Ian pulled up in front of the building. "Have a good evening, Jay."
"You too."
Jay got out of the car. He stood on the sidewalk and watched Ian drive away.
He took the elevator to his apartment. He made tea and sat on the couch, thinking about the past week. The chaos, the pressure, the exhaustion. The camaraderie of the team working toward a shared goal.
And Ian. Always Ian. Calm and steady through the storm. Protecting Jay from Gal's intrusions. Offering praise and encouragement.
Jay's feelings hadn't lessened. If anything, they'd intensified. Every shared glance, every moment of understanding had only made it worse.
Not that it changed anything. Ian was still his boss. Still impossibly out of reach. Still someone who would never see him that way.
Scene 2
After the flood
On Wednesday at four in the afternoon, after the final day of checking and corrections, all of the reports were submitted. Everyone breathed with relief. The worst was behind them.
The team left at a normal hour. Everyone felt lighter. The weight of the past two weeks lifted.
Jay returned home before six. He changed into his athletic clothes and went out for another run along the river path.
It was just as miserable as the previous one. He'd missed the gym on Saturday, and with how irregularly he'd been exercising recently, he could feel his form slipping.
But the weather was nice—warm and clear, with a pleasant breeze off the water. Being away from the office rejuvenated him. The last week had strained him, but all in all, it had been better than he'd feared.
He returned home sweaty and discouraged.
On Thursday morning, Jay went to Ian's office.
"Do you have a moment?"
"Of course."
Jay sat down across from him. "I'd like to request Friday off. Next week, I mean. The nineteenth."
"Any particular reason?"
"My family is arriving Thursday evening. They're staying over for the weekend."
"Of course. Take the day," Ian said. He made a note on his calendar.
"Thank you."
"Are they coming for your birthday?"
"That was one of the considerations."
"Your birthday is this Sunday, isn't it?"
"Yes. But I was too busy recently to prepare properly. We delayed the visit to next week."
"What are your plans for Sunday?"
"I don't have any."
"May I come over with a gift?"
"You don't need to—"
"I'd like to. If you're comfortable with that."
"I... yes. That would be nice."
"What time would be convenient?"
"Afternoon? Around two?"
"Perfect. I'll see you then."
Jay returned to his desk, feeling off-balance. Ian was coming to his apartment on Sunday. For his birthday. His hands were trembling slightly.
Ian knew he was treading on thin ice. But his fear that he'd lose Jay soon forced him to act. To create some memories, at least. To have something to hold onto when Jay inevitably moved on.
Throughout the day, both Liv and Ray had follow-up questions for practically everyone. Clarifications about processes, details about client preferences, technical specifications.
"What's the typical revision timeline?" Liv asked Max.
"Depends on the client. Some want changes within twenty-four hours. Others take weeks to respond."
"And if they request major structural changes?"
"We renegotiate the timeline. Ian handles those conversations."
Gal was quiet and pouting dramatically. She'd stopped bringing coffee to Jay. She'd stopped hovering by his desk. Instead, she sat at her own desk with exaggerated sighs, making her suffering extremely theatrical.
Jay did not engage. He was frankly exhausted by her. She'd seemed so level-headed when they'd hired her, but now she was nothing but dramatic.
But he also recognized himself from the past in her. When he'd been rebuffed by Ian and taken it poorly. When he'd sulked and withdrawn, convinced he'd failed completely. He remembered how wretched he'd felt back then. And despite everything, he felt sympathy.
On Thursday afternoon, he met Gal in the kitchen. She was making coffee and sighing dramatically.
"Oh," she said when she saw him. "I'll get out of your way."
"You don't have to."
Another heavy sigh. She poured her coffee slowly, like each movement required enormous effort.
Jay made his own coffee. He should leave. He should just take his cup and go back to his desk, but the memory of his own misery held him there.
"Gal," he said.
She looked at him. Her eyes were slightly red.
"Don't take it personally. The first few months are always the hardest. Everyone struggles. I certainly did."
"You seem perfect at everything."
"I'm not. I made mistakes constantly when I started. I still make them."
"But everyone likes you."
"That took time. And effort. And a lot of embarrassment."
"I just wanted to do well."
"I know. But there's a time and place for questions. During reporting season isn't it. People are stressed. They don't have the capacity to teach while they're scrambling to meet deadlines."
"Ian said the same thing."
"Because it's true."
"I thought if I stayed late and showed dedication, everyone would see how serious I am."
"They saw it. But dedication without awareness isn't helpful. You have to read the room. Understand when to push forward and when to step back."
Gal looked at him intently. So intently it scared him a bit. Her expression was too focused, too hopeful.
"You're very kind," she said.
"I'm just trying to help."
"No one else bothered to explain. They just exchanged looks and whispered about me."
"That's not—"
"You're different. You understand."
Jay felt a bad feeling creep over him. This wasn't gratitude. This was something else. He'd wanted to be kind, to give the encouragement he'd wished someone had given him. But the way she'd looked at him made his stomach turn.
"I should get back to work," he said. He left the kitchen quickly. Later that afternoon, he stopped by Ian's office.
"Do you have a moment?"
"Always."
Jay closed the door. "I talked to Gal earlier. I was trying to be helpful, but I think I might have made things worse."
"How?"
"She looked at me like I'd given her something to hold on to. I just wanted to tell her not to take it personally."
"You were being kind. That's not a mistake."
"But I have a bad feeling about it."
"I'll keep an eye on the situation."
"Maybe I shouldn't have said anything."
"You were trying to help. That's not wrong."
Jay wasn't convinced, but he returned to his desk and tried to focus on work.
On Friday, everyone including Ian left the office by five. It was the day of the quarterly party. Everyone wanted time to prepare. Jay had a hairdresser appointment at five thirty. He'd booked it weeks ago, knowing he'd need a trim. Jay left the salon at six fifteen with his hair freshly cut and styled.
He went straight home to get changed. No need to eat dinner. Getting stuffed at the party was the highlight of the evening.
Scene 3
Impossible love
The quarterly party was held at a restaurant in the financial district. The entire company attended, filling the private event space with conversation and laughter.
Jay arrived at the venue at seven thirty. He'd chosen his best gray three-piece suit with the sapphire cufflinks Ian had given him last Christmas. He'd tried to go for a serious, stately look, but somehow he'd ended up looking absolutely gorgeous.
The venue was already crowded. People from different departments mingled near the bar. Music played in the background.
Luc spotted him first. "There he is. Looking sharp, Jay."
"Thank you."
"Rin is over there looking terrified. Go save him."
Jay found Rin standing awkwardly near a table. "How are you holding up?"
"Everyone here is so confident. I feel like I'm wearing a sign that says new hire."
"You'll be fine. Just relax and talk to people."
They chatted for a while. Jay introduced Rin to a few analysts from other departments.
The evening progressed pleasantly. Jay talked to Amy about her upcoming vacation. He listened to Max's stories about his daughter's graduation. He laughed at Kim's observations about the catering.
Ian arrived at eight. He wore perfectly tailored dark suit. He looked composed as always. His eyes scanned the room and found Jay immediately. Jay felt his heart skip.
Gal arrived shortly after. She wore a black dress and heels. She'd clearly put effort into her appearance. She made her way to the bar and ordered a drink. Then another. Then another. By nine, she was visibly drunk.
Jay was talking with Kim when Gal appeared beside him. She touched his arm.
"Jay. You look amazing tonight."
"Thank you."
"Can I get you a drink?" she asked.
"I'm fine, thank you."
"Are you sure? I'm going to the bar anyway."
"I'm sure."
"Come sit with me." She tugged at his sleeve. Her fingers pressed against his wrist.
"Gal, maybe you should have some water."
"I don't want water. I want to talk to you."
"How are you enjoying the party?" he asked politely.
"It's nice. But I'd rather talk to you."
"You should mingle. Get to know everyone."
"I'd rather get to know you better."
The way she said it made Jay's stomach drop. There was no mistaking her intention now.
"Gal—"
"Do you want to step outside? It's quieter on the terrace."
"I'm fine here."
"Just for a few minutes. We never get to talk at work."
"That's because we're working."
"Exactly. So now we can actually have a conversation."
Jay looked around for help. Luc had moved to another group. Amy was deep in conversation with Liv. Max was nowhere to be seen.
"Gal—"
"I think about you all the time. At work. At home. You're so—"
"Gal, you've had too much to drink."
"I know what I'm saying." She leaned against him. "I really like you."
Then he saw Ian across the room. Ian was watching him. Their eyes met. Ian set down his drink and walked over.
"Excuse me. I need to speak with Jay."
"Oh. Can it wait? We were just—"
"No. It's urgent."
Ian placed a hand on Jay's shoulder and guided him away. Gal stood there, looking hurt and confused.
They walked through the crowd and out onto the terrace. The night air was warm and still. City lights glittered in the distance. The sounds of the party were muted here.
Jay took a deep breath. "Thank you."
"Are you alright?"
"Yes. She's just... persistent."
"She's inappropriate."
"She's young. She doesn't understand boundaries."
"She understands perfectly well. She's choosing to ignore them."
They stood at the railing, looking out at the city. Jay was acutely aware of Ian beside him. Close enough to touch.
"I feel bad for her," Jay said.
"Don't."
"She's probably embarrassed. Struggling to fit in."
"Jay. What she's doing isn't acceptable. Following you around. Bringing you coffee uninvited. Asking personal questions. Trying to get you alone. That's not struggling to fit in. That's harassment."
"It's not that serious—"
"It is exactly that serious. Just because she's young and short doesn't make it not harassment. If she was a two-meter-tall man doing the same things, how would you feel?"
Ian was right. If it was a large, imposing man hounding him like this, Jay would be terrified.
"You're right. I didn't think of it that way."
"No one should be pursued like this. Male, female, doesn't matter. It's not appropriate. And I won't tolerate it on my team."
"What are you going to do?"
"I'll speak with her Monday. Make it clear this behaviour needs to stop."
"She'll hate me."
"She'll be embarrassed. But that's not your responsibility. You've done nothing wrong."
Jay looked at Ian. The city lights illuminated his face—sharp features, composed expression. But there was concern in his eyes. Protectiveness.
"Thank you for helping."
They stood there in silence. Jay could smell Ian's cologne—deep and sensual. It was intoxicating. He wanted to move closer, to close the distance between them.
Ian was rescuing him again, like a knight in shining armour. Like someone who cared deeply about his well-being. Jay's heart ached with the realization he could no longer deny.
He was in love with this man. Deeply, completely, hopelessly in love.
Not just admiration. Not respect or gratitude. Love. The kind that made it hard to breathe when Ian stood this close.
"We should go back inside," Ian said.
"In a moment."
They stayed on the terrace a little longer. The party continued without them. Jay memorized this moment—the night air, the city lights, Ian beside him in the darkness. Neither of them wanted to go back inside. Neither of them wanted this moment to end.
When they finally returned, Gal was gone.
"She left," Luc said when Jay asked. "She looked upset. Nearly crying."
Jay felt guilty, but Ian was right. What she'd been doing wasn't acceptable. She needed to learn that.
The party continued. Jay talked with more colleagues, drank another glass of wine, but his thoughts were elsewhere. On the terrace. On Ian's cologne. On the way Ian had placed a hand on his shoulder and guided him away.
Jay left around eleven, when people began drifting out, calling goodbyes, making plans for the weekend. He walked to the metro station with Luc and Rin.
"That was fun," Rin said. "Though I ate too many appetizers."
"I'm going to sleep for twelve hours," Luc said.
They parted ways at the station. Jay took the train home alone. He entered his apartment, turned on a single lamp, changed out of his suit, and sat on the couch.
The burgundy blanket was folded on the armchair—the one Ian had used when he'd stayed over. Jay picked it up and held it to his face.
It still held traces of Ian's scent. Faint now, but unmistakable.
Jay lay down on the couch and pulled the blanket over himself. He buried his face in the fabric and tried to breathe normally.
But he couldn't. His chest felt tight, his heart too large for his ribcage.
Ian was so perfect. So tender and lovely. The way he'd noticed Jay's discomfort. The way he protected Jay from things Jay didn't even realize he needed protection from.
How could Jay go on with his life when his heart was swallowed whole by these feelings?
How could he sit across from Ian every day, see him through the glass wall, work beside him during late evenings, and pretend he didn't feel this way? How could he survive loving someone who would never love him back?
Jay curled tighter around the blanket. Ian was everything Jay had ever wanted and everything he could never have. The impossibility of it crushed him. He lay there in the darkness, breathing in the fading scent of Ian's cologne, and let himself fall apart.
He cried quietly. Not dramatic, heaving sobs. Just silent tears sliding down his face, soaking into the burgundy fabric.
He loved Ian. He loved him so completely it hurt.
And there was nothing he could do about it. Nothing except continue as he had been. Working beside him. Accepting whatever small moments of closeness Ian offered. Pretending his heart wasn't breaking every single day.
Eventually, exhaustion pulled him under. He fell asleep on the couch, still clutching the blanket, still breathing in the ghost of Ian's scent.
In his dreams, they were on the terrace again. But this time Ian didn't step back. This time Ian moved closer, cupped Jay's face in his hands, and—
Jay woke with a start. Dawn light filtered through the windows. The blanket had slipped to the floor.
He sat up slowly, disoriented and hollow. His eyes felt swollen. The dream faded, leaving only the cold reality of morning. Jay got up and folded the blanket. He returned it to the armchair where it belonged.
Then he went to the bathroom and washed his face. In the mirror, he looked tired and sad. He made coffee and sat on the balcony. The city was waking up around him. The river sparkled in the morning light.
He thought about Ian twelve minutes away. Probably still asleep. Probably never thinking about Jay the way Jay thought about him.
It hurt. It would always hurt, but Jay would endure it. Because being near Ian, even with this impossible love, was better than not being near him at all.
Scene 4
I notice what you need
Saturday's gym visit brought Jay some relief. The exercise cleared his mind, burning away the fog of emotions.
Rus found him at the weight rack. "Birthday coming up, right?"
"Tomorrow."
"Any plans?"
"Not particularly. My family is coming next week to stay over the weekend."
"We should make a party then. Get everyone together. Celebrate properly."
Jay was sceptical. "I don't need a party."
"Everyone needs a party once in a while."
"I'm not really a party person."
"I know. But think about it. Just drinks at a bar. Nothing elaborate."
"My siblings are still children. I don't think—"
"Perfect. We'll make it fun for everyone." Rus was smiling a devious smile.
"Rus—"
"Trust me. It'll be great."
Jay didn't commit, but Rus looked pleased anyway, like he'd already decided it was happening.
After the gym, Jay went shopping for clothes. He needed to look nice for Ian's visit. But not obvious that he was trying so hard. Not desperate. He visited four different boutiques. The first three didn't have what he was looking for. Everything was either too casual or too formal. Too bright or too dull.
At the fourth shop, he found cream trousers and a dark green shirt. The trousers fit perfectly. The shirt was well-cut, flattering without being ostentatious. He bought them and went home.
Sunday was his birthday. He woke early and cleaned the apartment to perfection. He wiped down surfaces, organized the kitchen, arranged books on the shelf. Everything had to be just right.
At noon, he showered and got dressed. He checked his reflection multiple times. Too much? Not enough? It seemed acceptable.
Ian arrived at two in the afternoon. Jay heard the knock and opened the door.
Ian stood in the hallway holding a large package. He was dressed casually—dark trousers, a light blue shirt, no tie.
"Happy birthday," Ian said.
"Thank you. Come in."
Ian entered and set the package on the kitchen counter. "I hope you like it."
"You didn't have to go to so much trouble."
"It was no trouble."
They stood in the kitchen. Jay gestured to the package.
"Should I open it?"
"Please."
Jay removed the wrapping. Inside was a coffee maker—sleek, compact, elegant. White with chrome accents. The brand name meant nothing to him.
"I like and trust the brand. I've had mine for years. It's reliable and makes excellent coffee."
There were also several bags of different coffee blends. Dark roast, medium roast, something labeled "morning blend," another called "evening decaf."
"I didn't know which you'd prefer, so I brought a selection."
Jay stared at it. "This is too much."
"You mentioned wanting a coffee maker but not knowing which to choose. I thought I could help."
"Thank you."
"Shall we set it up?"
They unpacked the machine together. Ian explained the functions, showed him how to fill the water reservoir, how to adjust the strength settings. Within fifteen minutes, they had it running.
"Let's try it," Ian said.
They made coffee and took their cups to the balcony. The weather was beautiful, warm and clear. The river sparkled in the afternoon sun. Jay sipped his coffee. It was excellent.
"How do you feel? After yesterday," Ian asked.
"I'm fine."
"Gal's behaviour was unacceptable. I'll speak with her Monday."
"You don't need to—"
"Yes, I do. This can't happen again."
Jay felt a complicated mix of emotions. Guilt for Gal. Gratitude toward Ian. And underneath it all, the aching awareness that Ian was protecting him again.
"Thank you for intervening."
"It was necessary."
They drank their coffee. Jay was shaken for an entirely different reason than Ian thought. Not because of Gal's harassment. But because of this—sitting on his balcony with Ian, drinking coffee from a machine Ian had chosen for him, feeling the weight of impossible love pressing against his ribs.
"This coffee is really good," Jay said, desperate to change the subject.
"I'm glad you like it."
The afternoon stretched on. Ian stayed, and they kept talking. About work, about the upcoming week, about nothing in particular. The conversation was comfortable, like the retreat, like those long winter evenings in the office.
"I've been trying to run," Jay confessed at one point. "Along the river. But I'm terrible at it."
"How so?"
"My form is awful. I get winded immediately. I feel ridiculous."
"Running takes practice. It's not something you just know how to do."
"You run, don't you?"
"I used to run regularly. I don't do it often these days."
"You make it seem effortless."
Ian smiled slightly. "It's not. But I've been doing it for years. I could give you tips if you'd like. We could run together one of these days."
Jay's heart skipped. "You'd do that?"
"Of course. I'd welcome a change of pace from the gym."
"That would be helpful. Thank you."
They finished their coffee and Jay made more. It was late afternoon when Ian finally got up to leave.
"I should go. Let you enjoy the rest of your birthday."
"Thank you for coming. And for the gift. It's wonderful."
"I'm glad."
They walked to the door. Ian paused in the hallway.
"Happy birthday, Jay. I hope this year brings you everything you want."
"Thank you."
They looked at each other. Jay wanted to say so much. That having Ian here had made his birthday wonderful. That he wished Ian could stay. But he said nothing. 
Ian smiled and left.
Jay closed the door and leaned against it. The apartment felt empty.
He looked at the coffee maker sitting on his counter. A gift that said "I pay attention. I notice what you need."
Ian had stayed for hours, and he had no idea how much it meant. No idea that every moment with him was both a gift and an agony.
Jay's eyes burned. He went to the couch and picked up the burgundy blanket. He pulled it around his shoulders and sat there as evening fell, wishing things could be different.
Meanwhile, Ian drove home wistfully. He kept thinking about how Jay had looked today. How comfortable Jay seemed in his new home. How domestic it had felt, sitting on the balcony drinking coffee together.
Jay had found peace here. A beautiful apartment, a stable career, confidence in himself. Ian would do anything to protect that peace Jay had found. Anything to keep him safe and happy. Even if it meant never telling Jay how he felt. Even if it meant watching from a distance as Jay eventually found someone else.
Because Jay deserved happiness. Ian would protect that possibility, whatever the cost.
He parked in his building's garage and took the elevator up to his apartment. The space felt cold after the warmth of Jay's home.
Ian poured himself a drink and stood by the window. Twelve minutes away, Jay was probably making dinner. Maybe trying out the coffee maker again. Maybe thinking about the week ahead.
Ian hoped he was happy. Hoped the birthday had been good. Hoped Jay knew how much he was valued, even if Ian could never say it the way he wanted to.
Scene 5
Complications
On Monday, Ian had a talk with Gal behind closed doors first thing in the morning. It lasted fifteen minutes. When she emerged, her face was blotchy and red. She went straight to the bathroom. She clearly cried there.
When she returned to her desk, she started acting erratically. Dropping files with a thud. Getting up suddenly and leaving the office without a word. She didn't go out for lunch with the rest of the team. She sat at her desk, eating something from a plastic container, not talking to anyone.
Jay felt guilty. If he'd had better social skills, this situation wouldn't have needed to come to this. If he'd been clearer from the start, discouraged her more effectively—
Ian appeared at his desk during the afternoon.
"Do you have a moment?"
"Of course."
They went to Ian's office. Ian closed the door.
"I wanted to let you know I spoke with Gal this morning. Made it very clear that her behaviour needs to change immediately."
"She seemed upset."
"She was. But that's not your concern."
"I feel responsible—"
"You're not. This is my responsibility. You did nothing wrong. I'll deal with whatever problems arise."
Jay looked at him. Ian's expression was gentle, like he'd shoulder any burden to keep Jay safe. Jay felt something melt in his chest. 
"Thank you," Jay said.
Jay tended to stay late on Mondays. There was always additional work that piled up during the weekend, even during slower periods. But that day he left with the rest of the team after five.
Everyone was relieved the difficult reporting period was behind them and they could finally live like normal people. Luc stretched dramatically. Kim mentioned plans to catch up on sleep. Jay nodded along. But privately, he didn't stay because the situation weighed on him. His feelings, the trouble at work, all of it compounding to make him feel troubled.
He went for a long walk through his new neighbourhood to clear his head. The evening was warm, the streets busy with people finishing their workdays. He walked along the river, then through residential streets.
He'd never been one to rely on other people for protection. He'd always tried to carry his burdens himself. It was safer that way. Less disappointing when people inevitably let you down.
But with Ian, it felt natural. Ian was someone who solved problems, who shielded others, who stood at the helm and weathered whatever storms came his way. Reliable, unbreakable.
More than that, Jay wanted to be protected by him. It didn't hurt his pride or make him feel less. It made him feel cared for. And it was an intoxicating feeling.
He walked until the light began to fade, then returned home. He made dinner and sat on the balcony, thinking about his life.
On Tuesday, the atmosphere was even tenser. Gal had ceased sighing and moping. Instead, she'd turned passive-aggressive.
She responded to questions with technically correct answers that somehow managed to sound hostile. When Zoe asked her to review a file, she said "Fine" in a curt tone. When Rin accidentally bumped her desk, she glared at him.
The old workers just rolled their eyes and ignored her moods. Max remained jovial and unbothered, Kim made a comment under his breath that made Ela snort.
But Rin was clearly bothered by it. He laughed nervously and tried to get out of Gal's way, moving around the office like he was on a minefield.
Meanwhile, at lunch, Luc was being weird.
"So Jay. What kind of food do you like?"
"What?"
"For eating. What's your preference?"
"I don't have one particular favourite."
"But if you had to choose. What would you want?"
"Why are you asking?"
"Just curious. And what about venues? Do you like loud places or quieter ones?"
Jay narrowed his eyes. "What are you planning?"
"Nothing. Just making conversation. Tell me about your family. How many siblings do you have?"
"Three."
"Ages?"
"Luc, what is this?"
"Just getting to know you better."
Jay didn't believe him for a second.
Later that afternoon, Luc was not-so-secretly convening with Zoe and Ian in Ian's office behind closed doors. Through the glass wall, Jay watched them. Luc was gesticulating wildly, pointing at Jay repeatedly. Zoe was nodding. Ian looked patient but slightly resigned.
Jay was unhappy the doors provided decent soundproofing because he was certain they were scheming.
At three, Ian sent him a text.
"Meet me in Conference Room B in ten minutes."
Jay went at the appointed time. Ian was already there, seated at the table with a look that made it clear he was about to deliver bad news.
"What's happening?" Jay asked.
"Apparently Rus contacted Luc about your birthday party."
Jay's heart sank. "Oh no."
"Luc is being very spirited about it. He and Zoe are organizing it for Saturday. It's not exactly a secret, but they fully intend to organize everything and present you with a fait accompli."
"Of course they do."
"I'm against the surprise aspect. If you don't want this, I will very much effectively dissuade them from the idea."
Jay sighed dramatically and shook his head in resignation. As if he didn't already have enough on his plate. His overeager friends had decided to make things with his family awkward.
"Let them do what they want. I can drag my mom and siblings to a pub for an hour. What's the worst that can happen? At least Rus and Luc won't be nagging me for the rest of my life for being antisocial."
"Are you sure?"
"Yes. They clearly want to do this. I'm not going to fight them on it."
"Alright."
"You're free to come as well. Since they roped you into it. If you feel like it, naturally."
"I'll be there."
Jay nodded and got up to leave. Ian watched him with worry.
"Are you alright?" Ian asked.
"Fine. Just tired."
Ian could see that Jay was in a peculiar mood. He blamed the Gal situation for it. The tension in the office, the guilt Jay clearly felt despite having done nothing wrong.
Ian resolved to deal with the situation quickly. He'd just let Gal go. She was on a probation contract anyway, like any new hire. It wasn't a problem legally or procedurally. But he decided to wait until the end of the month. He didn't want to make ripples and make Jay feel even more guilty before his family arrived. At least this way, Jay would hopefully have a good time that weekend.
Jay spent the rest of the week leaving at five with the rest of the team. He went shopping for groceries, cleaned his apartment again, prepared for his family's visit. On Wednesday, he bought fresh linens for the guest bed. 
Thursday evening, he returned straight home to cook. His mother had called to say they'd departed at two in the afternoon, so they should arrive around six or seven. He intended to welcome them with a homemade meal.
