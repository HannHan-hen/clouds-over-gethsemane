Chapter 32: Alternatives
Scene 1
Job search
February was ending but brought no respite. At least a couple more weeks of insane workload continued ahead, with only a brief break before another season of quarterly reporting began. The cycle was relentless.
The weather continued to be wet, cold, and oppressive. Winter was dreadful this year. The city felt like it was drowning.
Among this drudgery, Jay decided to start looking for another job.
It was always awful for him, stressful and unpleasant. He'd spent years avoiding even the thought of job hunting. But he felt miserable and needed to at least think he was doing something to change it. Staying felt impossible. Continuing like this felt unsustainable.
He polished his CV on Sunday afternoon, sitting at his small table surrounded by packed boxes. Adding his current employment to his credentials looked surreal. Turner & Associates, Assistant to the CFO. The words sat there on the page, impressive and damning in equal measure. One year of experience in high-stakes investment management.
He was worried it would only bring the wrong kind of attention. People would wonder why he was leaving such a prestigious position. They'd suspect he'd been fired or had done something wrong. Or they'd assume he was reaching above his actual capabilities.
He sent the CVs all afternoon, working through a list of over fifty companies that looked like places he could manage. Accounting firms. Administrative positions. Jobs where mistakes weren't catastrophic.
Over the following week, he received zero responses. Not a single one.
He checked his email obsessively, refreshing during every break, hoping for something. But his inbox remained empty except for automated rejection messages from companies with well organised HR departments.
He guessed it was on par for someone like him, and it only made him more insecure. Of course no one would want him. His fragile, bruised ego got another blow.
Work continued its brutal pace. The team pushed through strategy revisions, endless meetings, document reviews that stretched into the night. Jay tried to act normal. Ian tried to engage him in conversation a few times, but Jay kept his responses brief. He didn't want Ian to see how much he was falling apart.
Saturday came and he went to the gym out of habit more than desire. Rus noticed immediately that something was off.
"You're distracted today."
"Just tired."
"You're always tired these days. What's going on?"
Jay hesitated, then decided there was no point in hiding it. "I resigned from buying the apartment. I'm looking for a new job. Something less stressful."
Rus's expression was complicated. "Oh. That's... are you sure?"
"I'm sure I can't keep doing this."
"I mean, I get it. Your work sounds unreasonable. And not buying the apartment makes sense if you're changing jobs, it would be hard to manage a place that posh on a regular salary. But you don't look happy about it. Or relieved."
"I'm not."
"Then why—"
"Because I'm not good enough. My coworkers manage the demands much better. It's just me who keeps making mistakes. Who keeps failing. Who keeps being toppled by the stress."
"That's not—"
"It is true. I dropped an entire database table. A basic, stupid mistake that anyone with proper training wouldn't make. I'm barely holding on while everyone else seems fine."
"They probably aren't as fine as they seem."
"Maybe. But they're managing better than I am."
"Come get drinks tonight. You need to talk this through properly."
"I can't. I need the rest when I can get it. I'm barely sleeping as it is."
"Alright. But if you change your mind, text me."
Jay continued sending his CV over the following days, browsing company listings with resignation. Most places didn't feel right. Some were too similar to his first job—small firms where he'd be vulnerable. Others were looking for someone more qualified than he was.
Finally, as March started, someone contacted him. A consulting firm looking for an administrative coordinator. The pay was roughly half of what he currently made. The responsibilities seemed manageable. They wanted to schedule an interview.
Jay stared at the email for a long time before responding to confirm his availability.
He knew an interview probably meant nothing. He'd done plenty of interviews that landed him nowhere in the past. Getting called in didn't mean getting hired. Still, it was a step somewhere. Progress, maybe, or at least motion.
He looked through the glass wall at Ian, who was hard at work reviewing documents. His posture was perfect, his focus absolute. Jay felt something twist painfully in his chest.
He'd have to leave this place. Never see Ian again.
The thought made him miserable instead of bringing relief. His eyes burned with unshed tears that he blinked back furiously.
Ian was the best thing that ever happened to him. The kindest person he'd ever known. The only person who'd ever made him feel valued. He would never meet someone like him again.
Leaving his side felt unbearably crushing.
Jay turned back to his computer, trying to focus on the spreadsheet in front of him. He took a deep breath, then another, willing himself to hold it together.
Just a few more weeks of strategy season. The interview. Then maybe an offer, if he was lucky. Then a resignation letter. Then packing up his desk and walking away from this office, from this team, from Ian.
And that would be it. The best year of his life, reduced to a line on his CV that no one would believe anyway.
He worked until late that evening, staying long after most of the team had gone home. Ian was still in his office when Jay finally packed up at ten-thirty. Their eyes met briefly through the glass, and Ian raised a hand in farewell.
Jay waved back, then gathered his things and left.
He had an interview on Thursday. He needed to prepare, to figure out what to say when they asked why he was leaving such a prestigious position. He couldn't tell them the truth—that he wasn't good enough, that he kept making mistakes, that the stress was eating him alive. That he'd rather earn half the salary and live in his cramped studio forever than continue feeling like he was inadequate.
He'd have to come up with something. Career development. Seeking new challenges. Better alignment with his long-term goals. All lies, but acceptable ones.
Jay arrived at his apartment and looked at the boxes still stacked against the walls. He'd have to unpack them eventually. This studio would be his home for the foreseeable future. No river view, no clever storage, no balcony for morning coffee.
Just this small room with its narrow bed and tiny kitchen and the constant feeling that his life had gotten too big for the space and then shrunk back down to fit.
The apartment contract still sat on the table. He should probably throw it away. Or send an email to the agent officially declining. But he couldn't bring himself to do it yet. That would make it final.
Scene 2
Requesting a day off
The next day at work, HR sent an email reminding everyone about the upcoming retreat. Jay stared at the subject line. Apparently this was already the third email sent about this.
He remembered seeing the previous ones and filing them away without even looking at them. There had been no time to spare, and planning months ahead felt impossible when each day was a struggle to survive.
Now he actually read it.
The email was enthusiastic, full of exclamation points and glowing reviews of the venue. This year's retreat would be at a lakeside resort six hours south by bus, in a mountain region, scheduled for the end of May. The photos showed an upscale and opulent facility that still managed to look rustic, matching its natural setting. Crystal clear lakes, amazing hiking trails, brilliant vistas. The HR department promised varied and exciting entertainment and activities.
Jay smiled bitterly. It was unlikely he'd even still be there. Maybe he'd be gone altogether, or would have already handed in his resignation. There was no reason to think about it, to imagine himself at some resort months from now when he couldn't envision making it through the next week.
Yet he still read the entire email. He scrolled through all the photos and examined the list of planned activities.
The area looked beautiful. Peaceful. A place that existed in a different world from the gray, rain-soaked city pressing down on him.
He bet Zoe would be overjoyed. Luc would probably grumble about the long bus ride.
The workload that day was manageable enough that his colleagues actually discussed the retreat. Jay listened to their conversations with detachement, like observing people through glass.
"I'm disappointed about the room arrangements. No sharing this year. Everyone gets singles," Kim said to Ela.
Ela's response was too quiet to hear, but both of them smiled conspiratorially, which made Jay certain that last year's retreat was when they'd started hooking up. Or maybe they'd already been involved before. Either way, the shared room had clearly been a highlight.
"Finally, entertainment I'll actually enjoy. A fashion show! Thank god. Last year's activities were too artsy," Amy declared, reviewing the email on her screen. 
"I'm excited about it too. We should start thinking about outfits now," Ela said. 
"Absolutely. I'm thinking something elegant but comfortable. Resort chic."
They were already deep in discussion about color palettes and accessories.
Zoe was predictably excited about the hiking trails. "Look at this elevation map. Some of these routes go up to twelve hundred meters. The views will be incredible."
Kim was pumped about the oldies-themed disco. "I'm going to dance to songs from before I was born. It's going to be amazing."
Luc was surprisingly enthusiastic about horse archery. "This is brilliant. I've always wanted to try this. It's like something from a historical movie."
Jay honestly laughed at that. It was probably the most unorthodox of the activities offered. Of course Luc would love it.
Luc turned to him. "You should join me. How often do you get to shoot arrows from horseback?"
"Never, and I'm keeping it that way. I'm not riding horses."
"Come on. It'll be fun."
"No. Categorically no."
Max was excited about the boats. "There's kayaking and canoeing. I haven't been on the water in years. This will be wonderful."
It seemed everyone found something they were looking forward to. Even in the middle of strategy season's misery, the prospect of the retreat gave them something bright on the horizon.
Luc approached Jay. "You seem weird about this."
"I'm fine."
"We'll talk about it properly in two weeks, after things calm down. But you're coming, right? It's absolutely mandatory."
Jay just smiled and didn't answer.
He remembered the previous resort. The single most pleasant, exciting, and memorable trip he'd ever been on. The party with the amazing view where he'd actually relaxed and enjoyed himself for once. Slow mornings with Ian in their shared room, drinking coffee on the balcony. The diving lessons, the bonfires, the art show. All of it had been new, enchanting, magical.
He'd felt like he belonged there, like he was part of something special. Like he deserved to be in that beautiful place with these talented people.
He was sure this year's retreat would be similarly successful. His colleagues would have a blast. The resort looked incredible. They'd create new memories, strengthen their bonds, return refreshed and energized.
But he wouldn't be there.
Jay had other things to handle, to worry about. Practical matters that couldn't wait for some mythical future when everything would be better.
He went to Ian's office mid-afternoon and knocked on the glass.
Ian looked up immediately. "Come in."
"I need to request a day off. Thursday."
"Of course. Do you need anything? Company car rental, perhaps? If you're traveling somewhere—"
"No. Thank you. I'll manage."
"Are you sure?"
"Yes."
Ian clearly wanted to ask more, to understand what was happening. Jay felt the weight of that attention, the care behind it. Finally, Ian nodded.
"You have the day. If there's anything you need, anything at all, I'll do my best to provide it."
"I appreciate that."
Jay returned to his desk feeling sad. Ian was such an amazing man, such a great boss. In every aspect. Thoughtful, supportive, generous. He cared about his team, about their wellbeing. When Jay was clearly struggling, Ian was trying to help.
He was wasted on someone as pathetic as Jay.
Leaving was for the best. Ian deserved to only work with the most distinguished professionals. People who could match his excellence, who wouldn't make stupid mistakes or lose emergency funds or drop database tables.
There was a time when Jay had thought he was good enough to stay by Ian's side, to support him. Now the mere idea seemed ridiculous. 
He wasn't even good enough to safeguard his own savings. How could he possibly be of aid to Ian? How could he help him in any way?
He was only a burden. And the kindest thing he could do was remove that burden before he caused any more damage.
Jay pulled up his work queue and focused on the tasks in front of him. Practical things. Manageable things. One item at a time until the day ended and he could go home.
For now, he had Thursday. Whatever happened then would determine what came next.
Scene 3
The interview
Jay had the whole day off on Thursday and the interview was at two in the afternoon. He wasn't nervous, more resigned than anything. This was an act of desperation more than anything else. Whether he got the job or not felt irrelevant. 
He spent the morning reading about the company. It couldn't hurt to be prepared. It was a mid-sized firm specializing in financial services for small to medium businesses. A place that had existed for twenty years and would probably exist for twenty more without ever making headlines.
He wore one of his regular office suits, a navy two-piece that fit him perfectly. It was by any standards a presentable outfit, well-tailored and appropriate. He took his watch off and placed it on the table. The watch was too expensive, too distinctive. He didn't want to invite scrutiny. His wrist without it felt too light, like something important was missing.
He didn't take his leather bag, either. It seemed somehow wrong to carry equipment provided by his current employer to a job interview. 
He arrived comfortably before the appointed time and walked around the area. At least it wasn't raining, even if it was cold and gloomy. The building complex was in the business district, filled with offices of dozens of middle-class companies. Nothing special, nothing terrible. It felt comfortable in its ordinariness.
He entered the company with fifteen minutes to spare and got seated in a corridor with a couple of other candidates. The reception was plain—white walls, standard furniture, a few potted plants.
Jay immediately realized he looked overdressed. His suit fit too well, while the other men wore department store clothes. Nothing wrong with them, really. But Jay stood out. He felt slightly awkward, but hardly intimidated. That surprised him. A year ago, this situation would have sent his anxiety through the roof.
Another candidate left the office, looking flustered. He said his farewells clumsily and departed hurriedly, clutching his bag.
Jay waited for his turn. He'd read about the company extensively beforehand, learned about the market, the specifications, their recent projects. It was as good a place as any, if unremarkable.
When his turn came, he was led into a conference room where three people sat behind a table. The hiring panel. Two men and a woman, all dressed in business casual. They smiled as he entered.
"Mr. Hall, thank you for coming. Please, have a seat."
Jay sat and tried to judge the company culture from their appearance and behaviour. They looked normal. Friendly but not overly warm.
"Would you like some water?"
"Yes, thank you."
At least that seemed acceptable. Basic courtesy was being observed.
They asked him general questions about his work style, his strengths, his approach to problem-solving. He answered truthfully but without elaboration. When they moved to his employment history, he outlined his previous positions clearly, without mentioning the reasons why he'd quit any of them.
"And your current position at Turner & Associates? That's quite prestigious. What makes you interested in a change?"
"The work is ambitious and definitely a challenge I've enjoyed. But ultimately I'd like to advance my career in a different direction."
It was a blatant lie, but he delivered it confidently. What else was there to do?
"And why did you choose our company?"
Jay recited a dozen reasons about why he was interested in this particular market niche, their growth trajectory, their reputation in the field. All lies, naturally. He'd chosen this company because it was hiring for a position vaguely aligned with his skills. That was the extent of his interest.
He was surprised by how easily he lied. How relaxed he felt about all of this. Perhaps because he didn't care about the outcome.
The woman asked about his technical skills. He listed them systematically—database management, financial reporting, scheduling systems, correspondence protocols. All things he could do in his sleep now.
One of the men asked, "Here's a hypothetical. How would you sell an elephant?"
Jay responded with a dry joke. "I'd find an expedient butcher and market the meat by weight." 
The panel laughed. He felt slight distaste. At Turner & Associates, no one would ask trick questions. On his interview with Leo back then, he'd been offered proper refreshments. The panel had been polite and friendly despite him being a nobody and Leo being practically the company owner. The questions had been exclusively substantive—about his skills, his work style, his career goals.
The difference in standards was noticeable.
They asked about his salary expectations. He named a figure that was half what he currently made but still reasonable for the position. They seemed pleased.
He knew he was making a good impression without really trying. Months of experience at the highest level had seasoned him. The nervousness that had plagued him at his first interview was completely absent.
The interview concluded after fifteen minutes. They shook his hand, said they'd be in touch within a week, and thanked him for his time.
When he finally left, he didn't feel any particular way about the people or the position. They were well-mannered enough, no obvious red flags. The work would be manageable, the environment seemed stable. It was more at his level. Mediocre employees of a mediocre institution. People like him.
He took the metro home and let himself into his apartment. The boxes still lined the walls. The contract for the apartment he'd never buy still sat on the table.
Jay laid down on the bed and thought about what his new life might look like. Fifteen-minute commute to the business district. Sad sandwiches in a brown bag for lunch. Spending his time off in local parks instead of on tropical diving destinations. Just as he used to.
He didn't feel sad about any of it. He didn't need the luxury, the excitement. Those things had never really been for him anyway.
But then he thought about never seeing Ian again.
Never having their evening conversations over coffee and pastries. Never watching him work through the glass wall. Never hearing his practical observations. Never seeing him smile when something amused him.
Jay rolled onto his side in a fetal position and began crying.
He could survive without the money and the status and the beautiful things. He'd survived without them for most of his life. He could live without the diving trips and the company retreats. He could live without feeling like he belonged somewhere important.
But having to live and never see Ian again felt devastating. Like someone was slowly carving his heart from his chest with a dull knife.
He cried until his throat hurt and his eyes burned. The apartment grew dark around him as evening came, but he didn't get up to turn on the lights. He just lay there, curled around the ache in his chest, mourning something he'd never really had in the first place.
Eventually the tears stopped, leaving him exhausted. He stared at the wall in the darkness and tried to imagine his future. That mediocre office, those polite but unremarkable colleagues, that stable and soul-crushing life. He tried to convince himself he could do this. He wasn't sure he believed it.
Scene 4
Foolish feelings
Jay went to work Friday looking visibly depressed. His eyes were red and puffy, evidence of crying that no amount of cold water could completely disguise. The whole team was staying late that evening, pushing through the final stretch before next week's deadline. But at five o'clock, Jay packed up his things.
Luc looked up, surprised. "Leaving already?"
"Yes."
"You okay?"
"Fine. Just tired."
He left without further explanation, feeling everyone's eyes on him as he walked to the elevator.
The next week would be the final push before they needed to finalize the new strategy. Everyone would work all weekend except Jay and Kim, since neither of them actually did the strategy work itself. Their support tasks could wait until Monday.
Jay should have felt relieved about the weekend off. Instead, he felt crushed. Because the interview had actually gone well. There was a good chance he'd get the job. And that would mean leaving Ian.
He was starting to think that whatever pain and anxiety he felt due to his job, none of it was even close to the pain of having to leave Ian. When had he become so attached? When had Ian become so central to his life, like oxygen?
He was confused. Mostly he was miserable. He didn't know anymore what he should do.
He knew he liked Ian. Respected him, admired him even. But it seemed that it was way more than that. Way deeper.
Jay returned to his apartment that afternoon but couldn't stand to sit there surrounded by his packed boxes. He needed to be around people.
He went to Café Lemon and was glad to find Fay there. It was quite busy since it was Friday afternoon, but he sat at a table and ordered coffee. Then another coffee. Then a third.
The afternoon turned into evening. The café gradually emptied as people went home for their weekends. Fay came over to refill his cup yet again.
"You've been sitting here for hours. Something on your mind?"
"Can I ask your advice about something?"
"Of course." She sat on the seat across from him. "What's going on?"
Jay tried to formulate his thoughts. "The work is great but very stressful. I decided to look for a new position and give up the apartment because I couldn't cope with the demands. But leaving means I'll never get to see a particular coworker anymore, and that seems extremely sad."
"A particular coworker?"
"Yes."
"What's special about this coworker?"
Jay smiled despite his misery. "They're the best person I've ever met. Incredibly talented and dedicated. They've been through so much but never let it break them. Strong but not cruel. Principled. They've been so kind to me, so supportive. They defend me when others won't. They make me want to be better just by being around them."
"Oh, honey. You're head over heels in love."
Jay blushed madly. "That's ridiculous. They're... unavailable. Taken."
"Ah." Fay's expression turned sympathetic. "Unrequited love is the worst. Maybe leaving really is best, then. It'll hurt like hell for a while, maybe even for months, but staying would just prolong the pain, and you'll eventually move on."
"I don't want to move on."
"That's the problem with love. We rarely want what's good for us.""
"Right. That makes sense."
"Does it help?"
"Not really."
Fay squeezed his hand. "I'm sorry. That's a terrible position to be in."
Jay returned home feeling worse than when he'd left. It was silly. He wasn't in love with Ian. He admired Ian, but Ian was someone he couldn't harbour such feelings about.
Ian was someone who was absolutely out of his reach for more than one reason. Ian had been betrayed before by someone in exactly Jay's position, had his heart broken and his reputation damaged. Ian would never risk that again.
Plus, Jay would never have romantic feelings for a supervisor. That was foolish. Inappropriate.
Except the feelings were there regardless of what was wise or appropriate.
Jay sat on his bed and tried to reason with himself. This was just attachment born of proximity and stress. Ian had been kind to him during difficult times. That naturally created strong positive feelings. It didn't mean anything deeper.
But he couldn't convince himself. The thought of never seeing Ian again felt like losing a limb. Something essential, something he'd built his life around without realizing it.
He didn't know what to do with that realization.
Meanwhile, Ian sat in his office long after everyone else had left, pretending to work on strategy documents while his mind circled the same problem repeatedly.
He strongly suspected Jay had gone to a job interview. It made sense. According to his estimates, it was ten percent chance Jay needed a rest day, ten percent it was a medical visit or family emergency, eighty percent he'd had a job interview.
All the signs pointed to that. When a stressed employee requested a day off with short notice, it meant one thing. Plus the long hours, the unreasonable pressure that resulted in mistakes, the constant draining social demands. The way Ian had probably made him uncomfortable with that comment after the gala. Jay's recent withdrawal.
His instincts were correct and Jay was pulling back. The work environment had turned hostile, and Jay was building an exit strategy.
So the fact that he'd come back from his day off looking defeated was actually a good sign. Naturally it pained Ian to see him suffer, but at the same time, if the interview had gone poorly, it bought time to remedy at least some of the problems.
One more week. One more week of the intense strategy work, and they'd have some breathing room. Then he'd be able to take corrective action.
They hadn't done yearly reviews because there simply hadn't been time. But Ian would make sure Jay felt valued. A raise, more favourable conditions, something that would make him feel more secure. A company car, whatever Jay needed. Maybe a promotion if he wanted it, or a transfer to another department if working directly under Ian was too difficult or if he wanted to advance his career in a different direction.
Jay didn't need to change companies. Everything could be provided here. Turner & Associates was large enough to accommodate different career paths, different working arrangements.
It didn't matter what solution they found, as long as Jay stayed in his orbit.
Ian would make sure to be as respectful and unthreatening as possible, to remedy whatever discomfort Jay was feeling. No overbearing gestures. Everything within the limits of their respective positions.
He’d been too forward. That was the problem. The Christmas celebration, the trips, the comment about Jay looking beautiful, the way he'd monopolized Jay's time during those late evening conversations. He'd overstepped, and Jay had rightly pulled back.
Ian would fix it. He could maintain distance if that's what Jay needed.
Ian should have focused on finalizing the strategy. The documents in front of him required his attention. Decisions needed to be made, projections verified, presentations prepared.
But his mind kept drifting to all the methods he would need to use to make Jay stay.
More autonomy, less direct pressure. Flexible hours. Additional vacation days. Compensation packages. Career advancement opportunities. Whatever it took.
The thought of Jay leaving was intolerable. Ian had lost too much already. He couldn't lose this too.
Ian opened a document on his computer and started drafting notes. Strategies for retention. Approaches to take during Jay's review. Benefits to offer, both tangible and intangible. This was what he was good at—strategy, planning, finding solutions to impossible problems.
He would make this work. He'd saved himself from ruin once. He could save this too.
Scene 5
Definitely not love
Saturday at the gym, Jay was barely through his warm-up when he stopped mid-rep and blurted, “Rus, what does it feel like to be in love?”
The question made Rus laugh so loudly that two people on the treadmills turned to stare. When he finally caught his breath he said, "Where did that come from?"
"Just answer the question."
Rus wiped his eyes, still grinning. "You can't stop thinking about the person. You can't imagine your life without them. Everything reminds you of them. Why?"
Jay went quiet.
"Wait. Is this about that secret person you used to go on dates with? The one who was out of your reach?"
Jay nodded slowly. "They weren't dates. And they're taken. But yeah. It's that person. I can't imagine my life without them. Does this necessarily have to mean I'm in love? Can't I just be deeply impressed by them?"
Rus couldn't stop laughing. He actually had to sit down on a nearby bench, shoulders shaking. "Oh my god. Have you been moping all this time because you're in love?"
"No. This can't be true. I knew from day one that person was unavailable. I wouldn't fall in love with them."
"Love is a cruel mistress. She doesn't listen to our wishes."
"That's not helpful."
Rus caught his breath and looked at Jay seriously. "Alright. Here's what we're going to do. Tonight, men's night out. I'll invite Mic and Van. We'll go to a pub. Nice and cosy, no survival games in the cold. Just drinks and love advice. What do you say?"
Jay agreed. He felt like he needed some perspective. He didn't want to sit in his barren apartment anyway.
They met that evening at eight at a designated pub, warm and dimly lit, with wooden booths and the smell of fried food. Mic and Van were already there, waving them over. They ordered beers. Jay made absolutely sure never to admit it was Ian. Rus would disapprove immediately since Ian was his boss. Instead, he kept it vague.
"So there's this coworker. An amazing person. A great mentor who gave me so much and made even the hardest moments bearable. I'm afraid of disappointing them and I feel unworthy to stand by their side. Also they're taken."
"Go for it. To hell if they're taken or not. Love is worth some transgressions," Mic said.
"That's terrible advice," Van countered immediately. "You should focus on fitness and work the love out of your system by sweating regularly. Ignore the person, continue the work, and focus all your free time on gains."
"Also terrible advice. You should find a new job and get some distance," Rus said.
"But do you think I'm actually in love?" Jay asked.
All three men answered simultaneously: "Yes."
"No one mopes for weeks and whines in bars over beers unless they're in love," Mic added.
Jay slumped in his seat. That didn't help at all.
They drank for a couple more hours, each man sharing their love stories. Some were quite comical. Mic was clearly a player, recounting elaborate schemes to impress various women, most of which had backfired spectacularly.
Van's stories mostly involved getting dumped for not spending enough time with his girlfriends. "She wanted flowers, outings. Who has time for it? I spend six days a week at the gym."
"I spend six days a week at work," Jay said.
Rus scoffed. "That's no way to live."
"Why not?" Van countered. "I understand the grind. As long as it's fulfilling, who cares?"
"I was actually married once," Rus admitted. "Divorced still in my twenties. We were military spouses. That often ends poorly. Dated a couple times afterwards, but it always fizzled out."
"So we're all four hopeless bachelors with obviously poor luck in love," Mic said, raising his glass. "Cheers to that."
They clinked glasses.
"My college girlfriend dumped me for not being adventurous enough," Jay said.
Van nodded solemnly. "Women are unreasonable."
"Or maybe we're just terrible at relationships," Rus added.
"Equally possible," Mic agreed.
Jay laughed, feeling slightly lighter.
"What do you guys do when you fail badly at something?" Jay asked after another round. "I cope poorly."
The men were all quite drunk by this point. Van said immediately, "I never fail."
Rus rolled his eyes. "When I got divorced, I moped for months. But finally life goes on, you know? You just keep putting one foot in front of the other."
Mic shrugged. "I fail about three times a week. It used to bother me, but now I'm used to it. You just need more practice at failing."
"That's actually profound," Jay said.
"Don't let it go to my head."
They kept drinking and complaining about various ailments—sore muscles, jobs, the price of rent, the quality of beer these days. Eventually Jay called it a night around midnight. All three insisted on walking him home. When they reached his building, Jay somehow ended up inviting them in.
They saw the sorry state of his apartment—boxes everywhere, bare shelves, the atmosphere of abandonment—and were suddenly more understanding.
"This is depressing," Mic said.
"No wonder you've been moping," Van added.
"It's no way to live," Rus concluded.
Jay produced the bottle of whiskey still left from his Christmas company basket. They were very impressed.
"This is good stuff," Mic said reverently.
So they stayed to drink more. Someone started singing. Then they were all singing, terrible drunken renditions of old songs, laughing and stumbling over lyrics.
At one in the morning, there was a polite knock on the door.
Jay opened it to find a weary police officer. "We've received a noise complaint. Will you keep it down?"
"Yes. Absolutely. I'm so sorry."
"Have a good night."
The door closed, and everyone scattered shortly after. Jay stood in his apartment, now utterly silent except for the ringing in his ears. He'd never been more humiliated in his life. He stumbled to bed without cleaning up, fell asleep immediately, and woke the next morning with a pounding headache.
He groaned heavily. These days, whenever he woke up hungover, there was Ian around with water and painkillers. This time he was alone and had to find water on his own. He was glad he'd left part of the medicine cabinet unpacked in the bathroom together with basic toiletries. He swallowed the pill and drank three glasses of water.
It was much more bearable when Ian had been around to comfort him. Ian always knew exactly what to do—the perfect balance of care and support.
Jay sighed and thought about the conversations from the night before. His friends were wrong. They didn't know the circumstances and he'd told the story poorly, so they misunderstood and misjudged.
He wasn't in love with Ian.
But that didn't change the fact that he didn't want to live without him.
The longer he thought about it, the more convinced he became that he couldn't leave. Staying would be hard and there would be moments when he'd suffer. He'd just take Mic's advice and get used to failures. It would surely get easier with time.
If that was the price for staying with Ian, he'd pay it.
He wasn't worthy to stay at Ian's side, but he still wanted to stay. He'd struggle and get hurt, but he'd still do his best to endure for as long as he was able. He'd find a way to cope, to manage, to become strong enough to deserve his place.
He didn't have to be perfect right away. He just had to stop being so obviously fragile that everyone noticed. He could do that. He would do that.
