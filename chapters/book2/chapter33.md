Chapter 33: What's worth fighting for
Scene 1
Resolve
Monday morning Jay went to work and his resolve was immediately tested.
He'd decided to stay. But standing outside the office building, watching the early light reflect off the glass, he still had doubts.
He arrived at eight to find half the team already there. Some looked like they hadn't left since Sunday. The air smelled stale—old coffee, takeout containers, and unwashed bodies. Luc was inside a sleeping bag in the corner, growling something unintelligible.
The scene was disheartening.
"Morning," Jay said weakly.
Luc made a sound that might have been a greeting or possibly a threat. He extracted himself from the sleeping bag with the grace of a dying animal and stumbled toward the coffee machine.
This was what Jay was signing up for by staying. Unreasonable working hours and incredible stress. People literally living at their desks, sacrificing everything for deadlines that never seemed to ease.
He battled with himself the whole day, stealing glances at Ian's office. Even Ian looked poorly. He was wearing a shirt with a missing button, his tie and jacket gone, hair ruffled. He'd clearly stayed in the office all weekend.
When their eyes met, Ian's expression was complicated. He sent a smile that was supposed to be reassuring but looked more like a grimace of misery.
Jay felt awkward being the only well-rested person in the office. But he quickly started working and the day moved forward. He stayed until ten that evening, shuffling materials, refilling everyone's coffees, delivering snacks. More moral support than anything else.
Tuesday wasn't much better. Jay had seen long days and weekend work before, but never had people literally lived in the office for days on end. The situation felt unsustainable, like watching a building collapse in slow motion.
Around noon, his phone rang. Jay stepped into a free conference room and answered.
"Mr. Hall? This is Meg from Accord Financial Services. We'd like to invite you for a second interview with our senior management."
Jay was reluctant. But he looked through the conference room glass at the disaster unfolding in the main office and heard himself say, "When would work for you?"
"Thursday afternoon? Say, four-thirty?"
"I'll be there."
He went to Ian as soon as he found an opportunity. "I need to leave at four on Thursday."
Ian's brows furrowed. He nodded without asking why, then returned to the document in front of him.
The phone call. The early leave. It all pointed to another interview. Or perhaps Jay had scored a second interview from whatever first interview he'd attended last week.
Why wouldn't he? Jay was competent, presentable. A candidate any reasonable company would want.
Ian gritted his teeth, feeling the ground leave beneath his feet. He'd hoped he had more time. But what if Jay got the job? What if Ian wouldn't even have the chance to set things right, would just watch as everything crumbled?
When Jay left for the gym at five that day, Ian looked up. Their eyes met through the glass wall. Jay could swear Ian was on the verge of tears—an expression of such raw pain that it stopped Jay in his tracks.
He'd known this was a bad time. He hadn't expected things were quite so serious.
Jay went to the gym with a heavy heart.
Rus was cheerful. "What are you still moping about?"
"I'm not moping. Just thinking things through thoroughly."
"And?"
"I think I'll stay. But I'm scared. Things are not good at work right now. Luc has been in a sleeping bag on the floor for five days without leaving the office at all."
"That's worse than my worst memories from the military. Maybe I misjudged how miserable my time there was. Perhaps the real struggle happens in finance."
"It was never so bad before. But we acquired a new very prestigious and demanding client recently. The workload increased while the team stayed the same size. Hence the constant drama at crucial moments."
"That's just bad management."
Jay immediately got defensive. "It's not. It's just that the work is difficult."
"If people are sleeping on the floor for days, that's bad management."
"You don't understand the industry."
Rus raised his hands. "Alright, alright. I won't criticize your beloved workplace."
Jay returned home and thought some more. He pulled out the apartment contract again, checking the bank conditions for the mortgage. If he decided to stay, he'd take the apartment. He'd move. Staying in his studio filled with boxes was only adding to his depression.
One way or another, he'd have to make a decision soon.
For now, he'd go for the interview on Thursday. He'd go straight from work and see how it went, how it felt. He wasn't sure what he'd do if he got the offer. But he'd have to actually get the offer before he could make any plans.
Maybe the decision would be taken out of his hands. If he didn't get the job, he'd consider it the will of the universe and stay. If he did get the job—then he'd have to decide on his own what to do.
Wednesday Jay stayed late again, almost until midnight. Half the team now lived in the office permanently. Only Kim, Max, and Amy left at reasonable hours. Kim because he didn't really need to stay. Max and Amy because they wanted to at least see their children every now and then.
Luc, Zoe, and Ela had essentially moved in. And so had Ian.
Someone had brought Ian fresh clothes, but he still didn't look well. Jay discreetly refilled his beverages and made sure he actually ate, trying to be unobtrusive about it.
Ian looked at him with an expression so pained, it was as if he was being tortured.
Jay approached during a quiet moment and whispered, "You've got this."
But somehow this seemed to have the opposite effect. Ian's face crumpled for just a moment before he composed himself.
"Excuse me," Ian said, standing abruptly and heading toward the bathroom.
Jay stood there holding the coffee, hoping he hadn't made some blunder. Seeing Ian like this was hard. This job was hard and he was weak and scared.
But he still wanted to stay by Ian's side.
He left the coffee on Ian's desk and returned to his own work. Through the glass wall, he could see the bathroom door remained closed for a long time.
When Ian finally emerged, his face was composed again, but his eyes were red.
Jay returned to his desk and tried to focus on work. Around him, the office was in chaos. Zoe typed furiously, eyes red from staring at her screen too long. Luc was in his sleeping bag, eating something from a takeout container while reviewing documents.
This was the reality of staying. Not the glamorous parts—the international trips, the Christmas celebrations, the evenings with Ian. But this: the grinding, exhausting work that demanded everything.
Jay wasn't sure he was strong enough for it.
But the alternative—leaving, never seeing Ian again—felt worse than any amount of stress or fear or exhaustion. He'd find a way to be strong enough. He had to.
Jay stayed until midnight, then took the metro home. He fell into bed fully clothed, too tired to shower.
Scene 2
Business district
Jay came to work Thursday morning as if nothing changed.
The deadline for strategy submission was tomorrow. Only finishing touches were being applied now, last checks made. Everyone was working on fumes, already feeling the finish line.
Luc had finally showered. Ela had put on fresh makeup. Zoe looked almost human again.
Ian was still in his office, bent over his laptop, but the tension in his shoulders had eased slightly. The worst was almost over.
The atmosphere was strained but different from previous weeks. There was light at the end of the tunnel. Exhaustion was mixed with relief.
At four, Jay packed his bag and left.
He took a taxi to the business district. It wasn't a long drive. He arrived with ten minutes to spare for his four-thirty interview.
He was wearing his regular office suit, his watch, his leather bag. He hadn't bothered to try and present an image anymore. If they had a problem with his appearance, that would tell him something important about whether he wanted to work there.
He surveyed the building and the area critically. It wouldn't be a bad place to work. Better than his previous workplace, at least. That building had been dingy, filled with a persistent smell of old coffee. This building was modern, clean. Not impressive, but solid.
The interview started punctually.
There was no one else in the lobby this time. Jay was led directly to a conference room where three people waited.
"Mr. Hall, thank you for coming. I'm Dan Miller, senior partner. This is Liu Serrano, operations director, and Mos Parker, head of client services."
"Pleased to meet you," Jay said.
They shook hands and sat down.
"We were very impressed with your first interview. Meg spoke highly of you."
"Thank you."
"So, tell us a bit about your current position. What does a typical day look like for you?"
Jay described his work. The reports he prepared. The meetings he attended. The clients he occasionally interfaced with.
They listened attentively, asking follow-up questions here and there.
Liu laughed at one point. "Sounds like you're doing the work of three people."
"It can feel that way sometimes," Jay admitted.
"That's finance for you. Always demanding the impossible and then acting surprised when people burn out," Dan said.
"We try to maintain better customs here. Work-life balance, all that. Not always successful, but we do try," Mos added.
"That sounds nice," Jay said.
"Have you been in the industry long?" Sandra asked.
"A little over a year at my current position. Before that, I worked at smaller firms."
"And what made you consider leaving your current role?"
"I wanted to explore other opportunities. Turner & Associates focuses primarily on high-level investment strategy. I'd like to work more directly with operational finance."
It wasn't a lie. It just wasn't the whole truth.
They moved on to salary negotiations. The number they offered was reasonable. Not as high as what he made now, but livable. Comfortable, even.
"When could you start, assuming we move forward?" Dan asked.
"I'd need two weeks. That's what my contract states."
"Perfectly reasonable."
The conversation drifted into chitchat after that. They talked about the realities and challenges of finance. They joked about the impossible clients, the regulatory changes, the eternal struggle to balance accuracy with deadlines.
Jay was relaxed. He'd attended so many meetings and negotiations already that this didn't faze him. He didn't try to make a good impression, but he also didn't try to sabotage himself. He acted as natural as he could, given the circumstances.
The entire meeting lasted half an hour, and most of it was spent on small talk. Jay suspected they were mostly trying to get a feel of him as a person, and not check his qualifications.
"Well, Mr. Hall, thank you for your time. We'll be in touch soon."
"Thank you for the opportunity."
They shook hands again, and Jay left.
He departed in a complicated mood.
He couldn't say how the interview went. It had felt easy, almost casual. Maybe too casual. Maybe that was good. He didn't know.
But with each passing day, he was more and more convinced that he wanted to stay.
The sting of his failures had begun to fade. He looked back at himself falling apart with shame. But at the same time, he understood that just because he was feeling better now meant nothing. He was sure to fail again, to feel that overwhelming misery again. That was what he was so poorly equipped to endure. He'd crash again, maybe harder next time, until something broke irreparably.
He walked around the neighborhood for a bit.
He rarely visited the business district. His previous jobs had been located elsewhere. It was modern, with functional buildings that were neither inspiring nor offensive. There were no impressive skyscrapers like the ones he was used to, but the area was well taken care of. Good public transport access. A decent place.
He found a restaurant for dinner. It was filled with local employees, tired people in department store suits who talked animatedly, mostly complaining about their work.
Such a stark image compared to the financial district's lively crowds discussing deals and international clients.
Jay ordered a meal and ate, watching the people around him. They looked content. No one was on the verge of collapse. No one looked like they'd been living in the office for five days.
He paid and left. On his way to the metro, Jay sighed deeply.
He wouldn't mind replacing the skyscrapers and distinguished colleagues for a down-to-earth working crowd. It was Ian he was unwilling to give up.
He had to at least try, didn't he? To fight for the best thing that ever happened to him. He'd never forgive himself if he gave it up due to his own weakness.
The metro ride home was quiet. Jay stared out the window at the passing lights, thinking about tomorrow. The deadline. The relief that would come after. Ian's face when the worst was finally over. He wanted to be there for that moment. He wanted to be there for all the moments after.
Scene 3
Battleground
Finally, it was Friday. The day strategy got submitted.
Everyone was doing one last sweep through documents, presentations, graphs, and spreadsheets. Searching for typos, checking calculations, verifying that every number matched across all materials. The entire office was filled with barely functioning zombies in mismatched clothes.
Only Kim and Jay looked presentable. It seemed Kim had taken on clothes duty, traveling to everyone's houses to collect essentials. But it was painfully clear which team members hadn't left the building in days. Luc wore the same shirt since Wednesday. Ela had given up on coordinating anything. Zoe's sweater was inside out.
Ian was deathly pale. Jay hadn't seen him eat anything that day, only endless cups of coffee. The smell of cigarettes clung to him so strongly Jay could swear Ian was smoking in his executive bathroom, but he didn't comment and didn't try to push him to eat.
There would be time to take care of that later. For now, Ian was hanging on by a thread, and Jay didn't want to yank at it. One more task. Just one more, and then this nightmare period would be over.
As two o'clock approached, Ian reviewed the final documents with red-rimmed eyes. Jay watched through the glass wall, concerned.
At exactly two-fifteen, Ian submitted the files. The strategy documents were officially delivered.
The collective breath of relief was audible throughout the office. People sagged in their chairs. Someone laughed, the sound slightly hysterical.
"We did it. We actually did it," Amy said weakly.
"I'm never doing this again. Next year I'm calling in sick for all of February," Ela declared.
Celebrations started, as subdued as they were from an exhausted crowd. A few people hugged. 
Jay's phone rang.
He glanced at the screen. Unknown number. He got up and moved to the closest conference room—currently unoccupied, with glass walls that looked out over the main office.
Ian watched him go. Watched him answer the call. Watched him smile and nod to whoever he was talking to.
The sinking feeling in Ian's stomach almost toppled him.
That was it, then. A job offer. It had to be. The timing, the smile, the way Jay's posture straightened slightly. Someone was offering him something, and Jay was accepting it.
Ian was out of time.
He stood abruptly, his chair scraping loudly. His voice came out strained when he addressed the team. "Everyone go home. Get rest."
Then he fled to the bathroom before anyone could respond.
In the conference room, Jay finished his conversation. "Thank you so much for the offer. I'm very flattered. Unfortunately, I've received another opportunity that I've decided to accept. I apologize for any inconvenience... Yes, I understand. Thank you for your time and consideration."
He hung up and stood for a moment, staring at his phone. He'd turned down the job. He was staying. Now he just had to prove he deserved to.
When Jay left the conference room, everyone was sluggishly packing and departing. Kim was escorting Ela out, one arm around her shoulders to keep her upright. Zoe was already packed and moving toward the exit. Luc struggled with rolling up his sleeping bag, cursing under his breath.
"Where's Ian?" Jay asked.
"Probably already went home to collapse," Luc said without looking up. "Everyone else is on their way too."
He barely spoke besides that, looking very worn out. Jay didn't push for more conversation.
Jay slowly packed his things but stayed after everyone else departed. The office looked like a battleground. Papers scattered across desks, empty coffee cups forming small graveyards in corners, someone's shoes abandoned under a table. The cleaning crews had been instructed to avoid the space until given clearance, lest they move important documents. They'd only come now to deal with the aftermath.
He looked toward Ian's office, where everything was left as it was. Documents still spread across the desk, the chair pushed back at an angle, Ian's coat still hanging on the rack.
Jay hoped Ian was alright. He certainly hadn't looked alright.
Jay sighed and took one more look around. He'd received a job offer, and judging by how quickly the call came, they'd been quite happy with him. He'd made an apologetic speech about receiving a better offer in the meantime, which was a thin excuse since he'd interviewed just yesterday, but he'd tried to sound convincing.
He surveyed the place where he'd chosen to stay. It decidedly didn't look inviting at the moment—more like a disaster zone than a prestigious workplace. But he still smiled.
It wasn't really the office or the work he was staying for. Frankly, the work was terrifying. The pressure, the stakes, the constant possibility of failure. But one last look toward Ian's desk as he headed for the exit convinced him he'd made the right choice.
Things that are worth it in life are rarely easy.
Ian, meanwhile, was stuck in the bathroom. He leaned against the sink, gripping the porcelain edge hard enough that his knuckles went white. He was exhausted to the point of breaking, and the sight of Jay cheerfully taking what he'd interpreted as a job offer felt like a nail in a coffin.
He'd failed. He run out of time. He spent weeks watching Jay slip away while being too consumed by work to do anything about it, and now it was too late.
Except it couldn't be too late. Ian refused to accept that.
It took him an unreasonably long time to collect himself enough to even think about returning home. He splashed cold water on his face, avoiding his reflection in the mirror. He looked terrible and he knew it.
He had the weekend to rest, recuperate, and be in the best form possible for Monday. He couldn't delay it a day longer.
On Monday, he had to convince Jay to stay. He had to find the right words, the right approach to communicate what Jay meant to him without crossing any lines.
Ian didn't know how he'd do it, but he knew he had to.
He finally left the bathroom and made his way to the elevator. The office was empty now, everyone gone. Just him and the silence and the weight of his failures.
Scene 4
Promotion
The weekend passed very differently for both men.
Jay went to the gym Saturday, his body enjoying the activity after weeks of neglect. He relaxed, did chores, caught up on sleep. On Sunday he traveled to the new apartment district and spent the entire day walking around the neighborhood.
The weather had calmed recently. The river looked much less menacing, even if the water level was still high. The area was beautiful, even in gloomy winter weather. The Sunday crowds were stylish—couples strolling hand in hand, families with expensive strollers, elegant ladies walking designer dogs.
Jay didn't feel any connection with these people, but he didn't have any bad feelings about them either. His previous dread was gone. For now, at least, he felt ready.
Ian, meanwhile, slept all Saturday. The exhaustion had accumulated to dangerous levels, and his body demanded rest. He only took breaks for proper meals, forcing himself to eat slowly and mindfully.
On Sunday he worked out intensively. The last couple of weeks had wrecked his form and it would take time to recover, but the movement cleared his head. He exercised, ate well, and planned his Monday meeting with Jay.
He rehearsed his lines in front of a mirror like he was preparing for a major negotiation. And it felt like the most major one in his life. Every word had to be perfect. Every approach analysed from all angles.
He went to bed early. He needed to be in top shape.
When Jay arrived at work Monday at seven-thirty, Ian was already there. In Jay's mailbox sat two emails. The first congratulated the team for successfully delivering the strategy, promising a dedicated meeting later that week about the aftermath. The second invited him for his delayed performance review.
Jay hadn't expected it. He hadn't prepared himself for it. He thought to himself that it would be funny if he actually got fired on the next workday after rejecting a job offer, and wondered if maybe they'd still hire him.
But he wasn't really nervous. He knew Ian. Ian wasn't someone who would surprise an employee with termination without prior notice.
The review was scheduled for nine. Jay entered Ian's office, closed the door behind him, and sat in the chair across from the desk. Ian still looked pale, still seemed worn out, but his clothes and hair were immaculate and he'd regained his former composure. Back straight, hands folded, expression controlled.
Ian started speaking in a very diplomatic way, praising Jay's contributions and work ethic, his ability to manage multiple priorities.
Then he apologized for the recent stressful period. He wasn't obsequious about it, but it was a very heartfelt apology. He took the blame for the pressure and everything that resulted from that pressure, assuring Jay that things would change for the better.
"While busy periods are normal in this industry, what happened these past couple of months was a failure of leadership on my part. I will remedy that."
Jay was surprised by that display. "It's quite alright. Everyone understands—"
"It's clearly not alright. Everyone can see it. This isn't even a matter of compensation for overtime, though that will naturally be addressed as well. It's a matter of putting undue strain on people."
Jay didn't know what to say. It was as Rus had said—bad management. But he absolutely refused to admit Ian was a bad manager.
Ian's tone lightened slightly. "While it was my failure and I admit it openly, I'll also ensure this gets fixed. I won't let my mistakes define me."
Jay smiled at that, recognizing Ian was likely addressing his own past errors, showing that there was no point dwelling and casting blame, but he needed to look forward. "That's a very wise approach."
Ian paused for a moment, gathering himself. "Do you have anything to add from yourself?"
This was the moment. If Jay wanted to hand in his resignation, this was probably it. Ian braced himself.
But Jay just smiled and shook his head. "No. I think you've covered everything."
Ian didn't address it directly, but his mind was already running recalculations. Maybe Jay had rejected the offer after all. Perhaps it wasn't very enticing. That gave him some leeway, but he still needed to be decisive.
He pushed a folder across the desk. "Your new contract."
Jay opened it and started reading. His previous contract had been standard—three years with a two-week termination period. This was permanent, with a three-month termination period. You didn't get a permanent contract until you'd worked somewhere for three years. Not unprecedented, but unusual to get it so early.
Then he saw the salary. A forty-five percent pay rise. Twenty thousand monthly. That was... obscene.
He kept reading. Additional vacation days. A company car if he chose to get it. An extended benefits package normally reserved for executives, apparently courtesy of the CFO position. More freedom in task assignments. A title change from assistant to coordinator.
That was excessive.
He read the contract twice, in silence, shuffling through the pages listing benefits. He looked at Ian, then back at the pages. Then he laid the contract down.
"This seems a bit over the top."
"It seemed appropriate. You do much more than assistant duties. Your position and compensation should at least reflect that."
"I can't possibly accept this."
Ian clenched his jaw hard. He spoke softly and quietly, putting attention into every word. "I can offer you another position if these conditions are not satisfactory. You could be moved to the regular team. Or switch departments, if you feel you need a change."
"I like being your assistant. I want to stay in the role."
Ian looked doubtful. "Are you certain?"
"Yes."
"Then you'll stay in your current role. Just your title will change to better reflect the duties you already cover. Assistants don't support regular team members in their standard assignments, after all."
Jay was still unconvinced. "The pay is unreasonable."
Ian smiled bitterly. "You'd still earn the least out of the whole team. While your duties are equally strenuous."
Jay sat for a moment and looked down at the contract again. Then at Ian, sitting there with his perfectly controlled expression. Hands still. Breathing even. Back ramrod straight.
Something unsettled Jay about it.
"I thought I was going to get fired," Jay said, half-joking.
"I would never fire you," Ian said very solemnly. "I apologize once again if the impression I made was one of displeasure. The period was stressful for everyone and I coped poorly."
"Yeah, you and me both," Jay said, which got a real smile from Ian for once.
Jay sighed and took his pen out. He signed both copies and gave one to Ian. Only then did Ian visibly relax, his shoulders dropping slightly, his breathing deepening.
"It seems I'm going to move after all. I really don't have any more reasons to delay it, and my boxes are all packed anyway."
Ian immediately recommended a moving service. "I can have the arrangements made today if you'd like."
"That's not going to be necessary. I don't have nearly that many belongings. I'll just get my buddies to help me. They owe me anyway."
"Oh?"
"They came over and were so loud the police were called, then left me alone to deal with it. Some friends."
Ian actually laughed, and the atmosphere finally relaxed. With that, Jay left.
He looked at his new contract blankly as he sat at his desk. It seemed he really did get a much better offer, just as he'd told the interviewer on Friday. But it felt suspicious. Ian's stress levels were obviously off the charts. He needed to at least try to remedy it.
Jay went to the kitchen and prepared a warming herbal tea with root spices. He brought it to Ian's office and set it down on the desk.
Ian looked at him strangely. "You don't need to serve me refreshments."
"My new contract included more freedom in tasks," Jay said innocently.
Ian sighed. "Thank you."
Jay returned to his desk grinning.
It seemed like at least something had been resolved favorably.
Scene 5
Mental fortitude
The following workdays were still busy. Occasional client inquiries about the strategy had to be addressed, and normal work that had been severely neglected needed catching up. But the long hours ceased for most of the team.
Max and Amy stayed late most days. The people who'd camped in the office left like clockwork at five, traumatized by the idea of overtime. Ela practically ran for the exit. Luc set an alarm on his phone and departed the instant it rang.
Jay stayed late as well, accompanying Ian. He watched attentively to make sure Ian returned to normal eating habits and stopped secretly smoking.
"You're hovering," Ian said Monday evening, looking up from his documents.
"I'm observing."
"You're monitoring my every move like I'm a flight risk."
"Are you eating properly?"
Ian sighed. "Yes."
"You look less pale than last week, I'll give you that."
Ian rolled his eyes overtly, but secretly he was overjoyed. The crisis seemed averted. But he couldn't get complacent. It was his fault the crisis had appeared in the first place. He needed to be more mindful, more proactive.
On Tuesday, Jay left for the gym. 
"So? What happened with the job stuff?" Rus asked.
"I'm keeping my current position. And proceeding with the apartment purchase."
Rus stopped mid-stretch. "You're kidding."
"I'm not."
"That's a mistake."
"You've mentioned that."
"Because it's true! That place is going to kill you."
They moved to the weights. Rus continued nagging throughout the entire session. Jay let him, knowing Rus needed to voice his concerns even if Jay had no intention of taking the advice.
"I just need to get more used to failure," Jay said between sets.
"That's literally the worst life philosophy I've ever heard. Did Mic tell you that? Because he's the worst person to take advice from."
But Jay was already certain of his decision. The fear hadn't disappeared entirely, but it had become manageable. Something he could live with.
That evening, Jay called the agent. "Is the flat still available?"
"Very much so!" The agent sounded relieved. "Has your money situation been resolved?"
Jay cringed, remembering his lost envelope. "It hasn't. But I thought more about it and decided I like the flat enough to make some sacrifices."
"Excellent! I'll come collect the contract right away and we can proceed with the purchase."
"That's not necessary. I can come to your office—"
"I insist. I'll be there within the hour."
Jay tried to protest, but the agent was unrelenting. True to his word, he arrived exactly fifty-three minutes later.
He was delighted when he saw Jay was already packed into boxes. "Perfect! This will make everything much easier. I'll proceed as promptly as possible."
Jay was once again suspicious about the man's enthusiasm, but maybe being a real estate agent required that level of energy.
On Wednesday, Ian announced a team meeting. Everyone gathered in the conference room.
"First, thank you all again for your extraordinary work during the strategy period. I want to apologize for the strain it placed on everyone. To address this, I'm offering additional vacation days, an additional bonus at the end of the month, and spa vouchers for everyone to get proper relaxing massages."
There were murmurs of appreciation. Ela smiled.
"Additionally, we'll be hiring new team members. Leo is already proceeding with preliminary CV collection and setting up first interviews with HR. I'll start interviewing candidates in April, after quarterly reports are complete. Hopefully we can hire people by May so they can join the company retreat and better integrate into the team. I'm thinking two to four people, possibly five if we find the right candidates."
The room went quiet. Everyone exchanged glances.
After the meeting, Jay approached Luc. "Why does everyone seem shocked about hiring?"
"Because Ian hates hiring. He's notoriously picky. Impossibly high standards plus very specific particularities. It's a nightmare process."
"He can't be that picky if he chose to keep me," Jay joked.
Amy, overhearing, rolled her eyes. "You're a rare and precious gem. The result of years of Leo's unsuccessful headhunting attempts."
Jay blushed and returned to his desk feeling sheepish. He'd heard stories about Ian being very demanding, which he'd concluded were grossly overblown. Ian was nothing but kind, fair, and generous.
The work itself was difficult and required endurance, he had to admit. It wasn't long ago when he'd been on the verge of breaking, and his position was hardly crucial. He could imagine it required great mental fortitude to be a regular team member.
It seemed the office would get more lively in coming months. There were six free desks in the main office and another one next to Jay. They could comfortably fit seven more people.
Apparently it had taken a long time for Ian to gather his current team, and many people had been fired along the way for failing to meet his exacting standards. Jay was curious to see exactly what qualities Ian looked for in subordinates.
This period brought another curious development. Every now and then, Jay would receive a call from some HR department offering an interview. His inbox would occasionally produce similar emails.
He politely answered all of them, informing each that he'd already secured another position. The awkwardness increased with each one as he had to scuttle to a free conference room or occasionally to the bathroom to take the calls.
"I appreciate the offer, but I've already accepted another position," he said into his phone Thursday afternoon, hiding in a conference room. "Yes, I understand. Thank you for considering me. I apologize for any inconvenience."
Ian watched from his office, first with concern, then with growing amusement as he overheard Jay's fervent apologies to the unfortunate HR people. Exactly how many applications had Jay sent?
Ian wanted to comment but reminded himself not to be too forward. He had to tread carefully. He didn't want to make Jay uncomfortable.
Jay was surprised they were reaching out with such delay. He'd initially thought no one was interested, but it seemed it took companies quite some time to process applications and reach out to candidates. And he wasn't as unpopular as he'd initially thought.
