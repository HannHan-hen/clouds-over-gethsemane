Chapter 23: Fragility
Scene 1
Wounded pride
When September started, the weather turned so perfect it made the city feel like a different place entirely. The oppressive heat of summer had lifted, leaving behind warm sunshine and a fresh breeze that smelled of autumn. Jay walked to work and tried to sort through the tangle of thoughts that had been consuming him since August ended.
He'd spent an entire year molding himself into an acceptable version of Jay Hall—upgrading his wardrobe, learning the language of corporate hierarchy, studying investment terminology in his spare time. All to ensure that the people surrounding him wouldn't find him too displeasing, too obviously out of place.
The tailor appointment had stripped away that veneer, reminding him exactly what he was in their eyes. Not a colleague or even a customer, but a project. The staff's condescension had stung not because it was unexpected, but because it forced him to confront how much of himself he'd been willing to sacrifice for acceptance.
He was a man of humble origins. There was nothing shameful in that. He worked hard, paid his bills, treated people with kindness. What right did anyone have to make him feel lesser for the circumstances of his birth?
He was still the same shy, somewhat insecure man he'd always been. The experiences of the past year had built his confidence in many ways, but they'd also shown him how far he still had to go to truly belong in Ian's world. Maybe that was okay. Maybe he didn't need to belong everywhere as long as he could find places where he fit naturally.
At least in his own neighborhood, people saw him as an equal, not as some charity case who needed to be managed and manipulated. The baristas at Café Lemon didn't look down on him. His neighbors nodded hello without calculating his net worth first.
He arrived at Turner & Associates feeling simultaneously grateful for the opportunity and resentful of the games that seemed to come with it. While Ian remained as considerate and brilliant as ever, Jay approached each day with a new wariness he couldn't quite shake.
At his desk, Jay worked diligently. Every report was flawless, every client interaction smooth. But when five o'clock arrived, he packed his things and left, saying only a polite "Good evening" to Ian as he passed.
"Have a pleasant evening," Ian replied. 
"You too. Don't work too late."
The late summer air beckoned him toward the small park near his apartment. Jay found a bench beneath an oak tree and simply sat, watching office workers hurry past on their way to evening plans. A year ago, he might have felt envious of their obvious belonging in the world. Now he wondered why he'd been so eager to abandon his own place.
On Tuesday, he went to the gym, where Rus welcomed him cheerfully.
"Look who remembers he has muscles. Thought you'd disappeared into some corporate black hole."
They talked between sets, a straightforward interaction Jay enjoyed the most. No hidden agendas, no calculation of words and meanings. Just two people talking about ordinary things.
On Wednesday, he followed the same script—competent work and departure at the stroke of five.
"Leaving at a reasonable hour again?" Amy observed as she gathered her own belongings.
"Trying to enjoy the nice weather while it lasts. I spent so much of the summer buried in work, I forgot what parks looked like in daylight."
Jay spent his evening at Café Lemon, drinking his usual coffee. The pumpkin spice latte had been nice, but today he wanted the comfort of what he liked best. Fay greeted him warmly, asking about his week without any ulterior motive beyond friendly curiosity.
By Thursday, Ian couldn't ignore the pattern any longer. He'd watched Jay's withdrawal with growing unease—the way his assistant's smiles had become more polite than warm, the subtle reserve he maintained during their interactions. Nothing dramatic, but unmistakably different.
"Jay." Ian approached his desk in the afternoon. "How are you finding the return to normal hours?"
"Very pleasant, thank you. It's good to have some time for personal activities again."
"Of course. The weather's been lovely for outdoor pursuits."
"It has." Jay continued organizing his desk, not meeting Ian's eyes. "I've been taking walks in the parks. I haven't had much chance to do that lately."
The explanation was reasonable, but Ian caught something guarded in Jay's tone. "Is everything alright? You seem a bit... quiet lately."
"Nothing's wrong." Jay's smile appeared and disappeared quickly. "Just enjoying the nice weather while it lasts."
Ian nodded, recognizing the deflection for what it was. Jay wasn't lying, but he wasn't telling the complete truth either. Something had changed, something that went deeper than seasonal shifts or workload adjustments.
Ian watched him leave that day and felt his stomach twist. He wanted to be the person Jay felt comfortable confiding in, wanted to help with whatever was troubling him. The defenses he'd so carefully maintained now felt like prison walls, keeping him from reaching the person he cared about more than was wise.
On Thursday evening, Jay was at the swimming pool again, moving through laps. The repetitive motion cleared his mind. Here, surrounded by the democratic equalizer of chlorinated water, everyone was just another body seeking exercise.
An elderly man in the next lane gave a friendly nod as they reached the wall simultaneously. "Nice technique. You've been swimming long?"
"Not really. Just getting back into it." Jay pulled himself up to sit on the pool edge. "I forgot how good it feels."
"Best medicine there is. Washes away all the day's nonsense."
Jay smiled. No one here cared about his background or his suitability for their social circles.
Friday brought Jay's third diving lesson, and Ina's praise for his improving buoyancy control felt more meaningful than any corporate commendation. When she scheduled his final sessions for the following weeks, Jay felt excitement about the October trip.
Ian watched these changes from his office, the way Jay seemed to be retreating into himself despite maintaining outward politeness.
He wanted to ask what had happened, what had caused this sudden chill to appear between them. But what right did he have to pry into Jay's personal emotional landscape? If Jay chose to reclaim his evenings, if he preferred parks and cafes to his company, that was not only his right, that was the best course of action.
Yet Ian felt the loss acutely. The empty office hours stretched longer. He'd grown dependent on those stolen moments of companionship, and now they were gone as suddenly as they'd appeared.
Late Friday evening, long after Jay had left for his diving lesson, Ian sat alone in his office in growing darkness. He missed Jay desperately. The distance Jay maintained now felt like a rebuke, though Ian couldn't identify what he'd done to deserve it.
Meanwhile, Jay walked home through the gathering dusk. The streets were welcoming, filled with people who belonged to his world. 
He thought about Ina's encouragement, about the elderly swimmer, about Fay. These people saw him as he was and found him acceptable. He didn't need to change himself for their approval or worry about measuring up to impossible standards.
Scene 2
Confusion
Luc's absence caused an unexpected disruption. His desk remained empty as the team filtered in on Monday, and it wasn't until Ian called the morning meeting that they learned he'd requested sudden sick leave for the entire week.
"Is he alright? He looked pretty rough last week," Amy asked.
"The request was brief. We should respect his privacy while ensuring his responsibilities are covered," Ian replied.
Jay felt a twist of worry in his stomach. Luc had been subdued since his return from holiday, deflecting personal questions. The curt dismissals, the hollow smiles—Jay recognized the signs that he was struggling beneath the surface.
During his lunch break, Jay sent a text: "Hope you're feeling better soon. Let me know if there's anything I can do to help."
The reply came back within minutes: "Fine. Just need rest. Thanks."
The brevity felt like a door slamming shut, but Jay couldn't shake his concern.
"I can stay late to handle Luc's backlog," Jay offered during the afternoon team meeting. "Most of his projects overlap with things I've worked on before."
"That's not necessary. You've already covered more than your share during the summer months. I can manage the overflow," Ian said, but his expression was complicated.
"I really don't mind. The workload isn't that heavy, and I know his client files."
"If you're certain you don't mind the extra hours."
"I'm certain."
That evening, Jay was back at working late alongside Ian. But something felt different—a tension in the air that hadn't existed during their summer overtime sessions. Ian seemed more closed off, the comfort of their shared work replaced by polite formality.
Jay tried to dismiss it as his own changed perspective. Perhaps he'd been reading too much into their previous interactions, imagining intimacy where only courtesy existed. But when he glanced down at the watch on his wrist, the weight of it felt real and meaningful. Too expensive, too personal to be a mere gesture.
On Tuesday, Luc gave another curt reply when Jay checked in again: "Still resting. Don't need anything."
The dismissal stung a bit. Jay went to the gym that evening, pushing himself through an aggressive workout that left him exhausted but no less worried about his colleague.
"You're distracted tonight," Rus observed as Jay nearly dropped a weight. "Work problems?"
"Colleague problems. Someone's going through a rough patch and won't accept help."
"Some people have to hit bottom before they'll reach out. All you can do is be there when they're ready."
The rest of the week continued in the same strained pattern. Jay stayed late Wednesday and Thursday, working through Luc's client files. The atmosphere was tense, and Jay worried—about Luc, about the tension between him and Ian.
By Friday, Jay had rescheduled his diving lesson to stay late again, though they were largely caught up with the backlog. As the office emptied around them, he made a decision that felt both necessary and terrifying.
"Ian?" Jay appeared in the doorway of Ian's office, his heart beating faster than the situation warranted. "Could I speak with you for a moment?"
Ian looked up from his laptop. "Of course."
Jay closed the door behind him and took the chair across from Ian's desk. "Is something wrong? This week has felt... different."
"I could ask you the same question."
Jay managed a half-smile that felt more like a grimace. "Nothing's wrong."
"It's not true, is it. I don't want to pry, truly I don't, but recently you've been..." He trailed off, then forced himself to continue. "Did I do something to displease you?"
Heat rushed to Jay's face so quickly he felt dizzy. "Of course not. You never—you've never done anything of the sort."
"Then what is it? You've been different since the beginning of the month. I know it's not my place to ask, but—"
"I had a rough weekend." Jay's words came out in a rush, cutting off Ian's probing. "Some unpleasant experiences that left me feeling unsettled. The feeling's been lingering, but it's nothing serious. Nothing to do with you or work."
He tried to inject some lightness into the heavy atmosphere, but Ian's expression didn't change. The concern in his eyes remained, along with something that looked almost like hurt.
"I see. I'm sorry you've been dealing with something difficult."
"It's really nothing dramatic. Just... reminded me of some things about my place in the world, I suppose. Made me more cautious."
The words were loaded with meanings Jay wasn't ready to explain and Ian wasn't in a position to probe. Jay touched his watch unconsciously, drawing comfort from its weight.
"If there's anything I can do to help—"
"There isn't. But thank you for asking. And for caring enough to notice."
Ian studied Jay's face for a long moment, and Jay had the uncomfortable feeling that his boss could see right through his explanations to the wounded pride and confusion beneath.
"You know I want you to feel comfortable here. Safe."
"I do feel safe." The words were true, even if they weren't complete. "You've created the best work environment I've ever experienced. Whatever I'm dealing with has nothing to do with that."
Ian nodded slowly, but the heaviness around him didn't lift. If anything, he looked more troubled than before, as if Jay's reassurances had only confirmed his worst fears.
They returned to work in silence, but the tension remained. The camaraderie of their previous overtime sessions felt like a memory from another life, replaced by performed civility that felt somehow worse than outright coldness.
As they prepared to leave, Jay felt the weight of everything unsaid pressing down on him, but he couldn't explain the full truth without revealing Leo's manipulations and his own growing confusion.
"I hope Luc will be feeling better by Monday."
"Me too."
The lift arrived, and they descended in silence. But as they parted ways in the lobby, Jay caught Ian watching him with that same worried expression, as if he were afraid Jay might disappear if he looked away.
Scene 3
Unspoken things
Jay was at the gym on Saturday, pushing through his routine while his mind churned over the previous week's tensions. Rus immediately spotted the distracted way Jay approached each exercise.
"You're lifting like your head's somewhere else entirely. Work troubles again?"
"Yeah. Can I ask you something? About work situations?"
"Shoot."
"Things got awkward with my boss recently, and I can't figure out how to fix it. We used to work well together, but now everything feels strained."
"Best advice? Stay as far away from your boss as possible. Nothing good comes from getting too close to the person who signs your paychecks."
"Right. That makes sense."
Under normal circumstances, Jay would have agreed completely. It was sound advice, wisdom that kept careers intact. But with Ian, everything felt different. The relationship they'd built—how could he explain that to someone who'd never experienced it?
Rus's casual dismissal only added another weight to Jay's growing collection of worries. If everyone else saw fraternising with a boss as inherently problematic, what did that say about the bond he and Ian had shared during those long evening hours?
Even by his own standards, getting close to a supervisor was foolish. How had it happened that he felt so connected to Ian? When had respect turned into something so much deeper?
The weekend passed on preparations and anxious thoughts. The final tailor appointment was scheduled for the afternoon, but this time Jay's mind was elsewhere. The staff remained condescending, but their words barely registered. His thoughts were consumed by the heavy atmosphere between him and Ian, the frigid politeness that felt worse than outright conflict.
How had Ian even noticed something was wrong? Jay had done his best to maintain composure, to ensure his personal crisis didn't affect their working relationship. Was Ian truly that perceptive, or was Jay more transparent than he realized?
Sunday brought his second-to-last diving lesson. Ina praised his progress, noting how much more confident he'd become underwater, but even her encouragement couldn't lift Jay's mood completely.
"One more session and you'll be ready for open water," she said as Jay surfaced from a successful emergency ascent drill. "You've come so far since that first nervous lesson."
"Thanks to your patience," Jay replied, but the praise felt distant. Everything felt distant lately, as if he were experiencing life through a fog of confusion and worry.
Only one lesson remained, and then he'd be ready for his October adventure. The trip that had once terrified him now felt like a welcome escape from the tension that seemed to follow him everywhere.
Luc returned on Monday, but the relief was short-lived. Their colleague looked terrible—pale, drawn, with dark circles under his eyes that spoke of sleepless nights and ongoing struggles. He sat at his desk, deflecting concerned inquiries with curt nods and forced smiles.
Jay waited until mid-morning before intercepting Luc in the kitchen, timing his approach when they were alone.
"Good to have you back. How are you feeling?"
"Better. Thanks." Luc's response was strained.
"Listen, I know you probably don't want to talk, but if you need a shoulder to cry on, I'm available. I know a place that serves the best hot chocolate in the city."
For a moment, Luc smiled. Jay remembered how Luc had taken him to that same café after his mistake with the deadline, offering comfort without judgment when Jay had needed it most.
"Thanks, Jay. I appreciate it. Maybe soon."
Later that morning, Zoe stopped by Jay's desk.
"How's the apartment hunting going? Last time we talked, you had several viewings lined up for this month."
Jay realized he hadn't thought about moving in weeks. The list of potential flats, the excitement about finding a better place—all of it had been pushed aside by recent events.
"I'm postponing it until November. Things are a bit chaotic right now with the upcoming trip and everything. Better to wait until things calm down."
"Fair enough. The market isn't going anywhere."
The idea of uprooting himself, of changing another fundamental aspect of his life when everything already felt uncertain, seemed overwhelming. His current studio might not be perfect, but it was home, safe when little else felt stable.
The week crawled by under a cloud of strained politeness. Jay and Ian were particular about their interactions, each exchange feeling simultaneously normal and completely wrong. They were both trying so hard to act naturally that every conversation became stilted.
Jay couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss, but he couldn't identify what or how to fix it. Ian seemed equally aware of the tension, his tone more formal than usual, his expressions guarded as if they were in Jay's first weeks at the company.
The weather remained beautiful—warm September days that should have lifted everyone's spirits—but the morale didn't improve. Luc's obvious distress cast a pall over the team, creating an atmosphere that Jay couldn't remember experiencing before at Turner & Associates.
Wednesday evening, Jay stayed late again to help catch up on work. They worked in silence, maintaining polite distance.
"How are the trip preparations coming along?" Ian asked during a brief break.
"Well, I think. The diving lessons are almost complete, and I have all the documentation sorted. The business trip should help with the whole international travel anxiety."
"I'm glad it will be useful." Ian's response was measured, appropriate, and completely lacking the warmth that had characterized their previous conversations.
Jay wanted to ask what had changed, wanted to bridge the gap that seemed to be widening between them despite their best efforts to pretend everything was normal. But how could he address a problem neither of them could properly define?
Ian, meanwhile, fought a losing battle against his own spiraling thoughts. He was terrified that his worst fears were coming true. Somehow, Jay had realized the depth of Ian's feelings and was trying to extricate himself from an uncomfortable situation.
He was ultra-proper, ultra-mindful, scared that one wrong move would send Jay fleeing entirely. If Jay felt unsafe, Ian would never forgive himself.
Friday arrived with no improvement in the strange tension. As Jay prepared to leave at the end of the day, he caught Ian watching him with an expression that looked almost like grief.
"Have a good weekend," Ian said.
"You too. Try not to work too late."
It was the same exchange they'd had dozens of times before, but it felt like a goodbye to something precious that was slipping away. Jay left the office feeling as if he'd lost something important without understanding what or how.
All because a tailor had been rude, because Leo had planted seeds of doubt, because Jay's wounded pride had made him retreat just enough to trigger Ian's deepest fears about wanting too much.
Scene 4
Sleepover
Jay was finishing his dinner when his phone buzzed with an unexpected message: "Can you come over? Could use the company. Sorry for short notice."
He stared at the text from Luc for only a moment before typing back: "Of course. Send me your address."
Jay had changed into his last pair of jeans and a t-shirt, stopped at the liquor store for the most expensive whiskey they had, and within an hour was standing outside an impressive building in the financial district. Luc had mentioned before where he lived, but seeing it in person was different—all glass and steel and elegance that screamed wealth.
Luc answered the door with red-rimmed eyes and a pitiful expression.
"You brought the good stuff. Come in. Fair warning—the place is ridiculous."
The apartment was indeed ridiculous. Huge windows with a spectacular view of the city, and the living room alone was larger than Jay's entire studio. Everything was sleek and modern, from the leather furniture to the abstract art on the walls.
"Four of us split this place," Luc explained, noticing Jay's wide-eyed expression. "The rent is absolutely obscene, but we all love playing successful yuppies. My roommates cleared out for the weekend—couldn't handle my brooding anymore."
They sat on the massive sectional sofa, Luc immediately pouring generous measures of whiskey into two glasses. Jay accepted his reluctantly, still not over how much he hated the burning sensation of alcohol.
"So," Luc said after draining half his glass in one go. "Cam dumped me."
Jay had seen the signs all week—the forced smiles, the way Luc had deflected every concerned inquiry.
"I'm sorry. That's awful."
"Is it though?" Luc laughed bitterly, already reaching for the bottle again. "I saw it coming. We'd been arguing for months about everything—my career, where we wanted to live. Eight years together, Jay. My entire adult life since university. The only real relationship I've ever had that lasted more than three months."
Jay sipped his whiskey and tried not to wince at the taste. "Eight years is a long time. Of course it hurts, even if you knew it was coming."
"She wanted marriage, kids. And I kept making excuses, putting her off, because I knew I wasn't ready. Maybe I'll never be ready for that kind of commitment. But she was tired of waiting for me to grow up."
"You weren't wrong to wait if you weren't ready. Forcing it would have made both of you miserable."
"Would it? Or am I just selfish and immature like she said?" Tears were gathering in Luc's eyes now. "Maybe I am just a shallow playboy who's afraid of real responsibility."
"That's not true. You're one of the most dedicated people I know. You work hard, you're loyal to your friends, you're kind and thoughtful. Being uncertain about marriage doesn't make you selfish."
Luc broke down then, shoulders shaking as he sobbed into his hands. Jay moved closer, offering the support he'd wished for during his own dark moments. They sat together while Luc grieved, the whiskey disappearing from the bottle.
"You probably never got dumped," Luc said eventually, his words slightly slurred. "You're so proper and serious, probably had girls queuing up for the privilege of dating someone so together."
Jay nearly choked on his whiskey. "Not at all. I was very much dumped, called boring and disappointing too."
Luc's eyes widened with horror. "That's awful! What kind of person would say that? They had no idea what they had."
The memory still stung after all these years—a girl from college, older and supposedly more experienced, who'd approached him with such confidence and charm. She'd made him feel special, chosen, until the night she'd told him that he was uninspiring in bed and that she needed someone with more passion.
"It was in college. A girl who thought she could teach me things. Turns out I was a poor student." Jay took another sip of whiskey, the alcohol making the confession easier.
"Jay." Luc's voice was full of sympathy. "That's terrible."
"I never tried again after that. Seemed safer to focus on other things."
They spent the evening trading stories of disasters and anxieties, the whiskey making everything feel both more profound and more manageable. When Jay finally looked at his watch, it was past midnight.
"I should probably head home," he said, starting to stand.
"Don't go." Luc caught his arm, desperation bleeding through the alcohol. "Please. I don't want to be alone with my thoughts tonight."
"Alright. I'll take the couch."
The sectional was more comfortable than Jay's own bed. It was, he realized with some amusement, his first ever sleepover—a milestone at thirty that seemed both pathetic and charming.
Morning arrived with harsh sunlight and the sound of Luc moving around the kitchen. Jay found him attempting to make scrambled eggs, his movements clumsy and his face pale with hangover.
"I think I'm dying," Luc announced dramatically. "But I'm making breakfast as penance for keeping you here all night."
The eggs were terrible, overcooked and underseasoned, with a rubbery texture that defied explanation.
"Now I finally understand why you got dumped," Jay said with a straight face.
For a moment, Luc looked stricken, and Jay wondered if he'd pushed too far too soon. Then Luc burst into laughter, the first trace of humor Jay had seen from him in weeks.
"That was cruel. Accurate, but cruel."
They sat at the ridiculous marble breakfast bar, picking at the inedible eggs and drinking coffee that was thankfully much better than the food.
"You know, this doesn't mean there's something wrong with you. Sometimes people just aren't compatible, no matter how much they care about each other. You'll find someone who wants the same things you do."
"Maybe. Right now I just want to not feel like my entire life just exploded." Luc managed a weak smile. "Thanks for staying, Jay. I know it's not exactly how you wanted to spend your Friday night."
"There's nowhere I'd rather have been," Jay said simply, and meant it.
He left before noon, declining Luc's offer of actual breakfast from a nearby café, and headed to the gym for a late session. Rus took one look at him and grinned.
"Someone had a fun night."
"I was out drinking with a friend who needed support."
"Good. I'm glad you actually have friends after all. Was starting to worry you were a complete hermit."
Jay felt lighter as he worked through his routine, glad he'd been able to help Luc through the worst of his crisis. At least one problem in his life had a clear solution, since someone like Luc, charming, successful, good-hearted, would definitely find happiness again.
It was one less thing to worry about in a month that had been full of complications. The awkward tension with Ian remained unresolved, but at least Luc would be alright.
Scene 5
Getting ready
Luc's condition showed visible improvement when Jay saw him at work on Monday. The red-rimmed eyes were gone, replaced by a determined expression. Jay found him at the coffee machine during the morning break, looking more like his old self.
"How are you holding up?" 
"Better. Marginally. Still feels like someone rearranged my internal organs, but better. Thanks again for Friday night. I needed that. Sorry about the eggs."
"They were memorably terrible. Look at it this way—at least now you can stay overtime as much as you want with no one nagging you about work-life balance. Silver linings."
"You're absolutely heartless."
"I'm learning. Give me another breakup or two and I'll be a proper shoulder to cry on."
Despite the joke falling flat, Luc smiled. "I need to get myself together. My roommates are already making pointed comments about my brooding affecting the apartment's vibe. If I don't snap out of it soon, they'll throw me out."
"Saving ten thousand on rent? However would you survive such a tragedy?"
"Now you sound just like Cam," Luc laughed.
The rest of the team seemed to sense that Jay's upcoming international trip was a milestone. Throughout the week, they offered advice with varying degrees of usefulness.
Kim was the most vocal about technical concerns. "Make sure your phone plan includes international data. The roaming charges will bankrupt you otherwise. And get a universal adapter—their plugs are completely different."
Max's advice was ridiculous. "Pack an extra suit in your carry-on in case they lose your luggage. Also, always tip the hotel concierge immediately. They remember faces, and you want to be memorable for the right reasons."
Amy was more pragmatic. "Don't drink the tap water anywhere. Even in developed countries. Trust me on this. And remember their business culture is more casual than ours."
Ela was all about sightseeing opportunities. "Make sure you get some time to enjoy the city. All work and no play makes for boring travel stories."
Even Zoe chimed in, though her wilderness-focused travel experience was less relevant. "I've never been to the New Continent cities, but I've heard their public transport is absolutely terrible. Just use taxis for everything—it's worth the expense not to get stranded somewhere."
Only Luc remained mostly quiet at his desk, still working through his emotional recovery, but Jay appreciated the team's collective concern.
Jay retrieved his suits from the tailoring house on Wednesday, a moment he had been dreading. He arrived at the appointed time, steeling himself for another round of condescending treatment.
The receptionist directed him to a private fitting room where his completed garments hung in perfect alignment, each covered with protective cloth bags bearing the shop's discreet logo. The senior tailor appeared with an assistant. 
"Mr. Hall. Your completed wardrobe."
They were three-piece suits—something Jay had never owned before. The charcoal gray was conservative and elegant, perfect for serious business meetings. The dark blue struck a balance between authority and approachability. But it was the burgundy that surprised him most—bolder than anything he'd ever owned, yet somehow still tasteful. The added waistcoats lent each ensemble a formality that felt unusual to him, heavier, more deliberate, as if the garments belonged to a different class of man.
Each suit fit perfectly. The staff remained as condescending as ever, but Jay barely noticed their attitude. He was too busy marvelling at how the expensive fabric felt.
"Everything meets with your approval?" the senior tailor asked, though his tone made it clear he couldn't care less about Jay's opinion.
"They're beautiful. Thank you."
Along with the suits came matching shirts, silk ties, leather shoes, protective garment bags, and a massive and very elegant suitcase. Everything charged to the company account, naturally.
Jay left with his arms full of expensive clothing and his distrust of Leo deeper than ever. The suits were gorgeous, but the motivation behind them remained suspect, and Jay couldn't shake the feeling that he was being prepared for purposes beyond simple presentation.
Jay returned home and began packing. He laid everything out on his bed—the new suits, his designer outfit from the company dinner, a more casual selection that might be appropriate for downtime. The massive suitcase could accommodate everything with room to spare, but his closet couldn't handle the storage implications. 
Thursday morning, Jay didn't go to the office to prepare for their afternoon departure. His appointment with the celebrity hairstylist Leo had arranged was scheduled for nine. The salon had a minimalist design and hushed atmosphere screaming exclusivity, but the stylist himself was surprisingly warm.
"Excellent bone structure. We'll enhance what you have naturally," he murmured, running fingers through Jay's hair.
The result was remarkable. The cut was flattering Jay's features while maintaining an air of elegance. It required minimal maintenance, but looked like he'd stepped out of a magazine.
Back home, Jay dressed in the burgundy suit, the one he had deemed most flattering. The deep wine colour was bolder than anything in his wardrobe, but the overall effect remained appropriate. The three-piece design made him look older, more established, like someone who belonged in first-class lounges.
Ian's watch sat at his wrist, now complemented by the expensive clothing. Jay caught sight of himself in his bathroom mirror and barely recognized the reflection. He could represent the company internationally without embarrassment.
On impulse, Jay took out his phone and attempted a selfie. His photography skills were generally terrible, but somehow the lighting and angle worked. The image showed a handsome young man with kind eyes and a slight smile.
He posted it to the social media account Ema had insisted he create, adding the caption: "First business trip". His family was the only audience, so sharing didn't feel inappropriate.
The phone rang almost immediately and Ema's excited voice practically vibrated through the speaker.
"Oh my God, Jay! You look amazing! Is that a new suit? It's gorgeous! Where are you going? Are there going to be other rich people? You have to take tons of photos!"
"It's just a business meeting. Nothing too exciting."
"Nothing exciting? You look like a movie star! Mom's going to die when she sees this. Are you flying first class? What's the hotel like? Is your boss taking you somewhere fancy?"
"Yes, Ian's coming with me."
"The Ian you never talk about but clearly worship? This is so exciting! You're living like a proper businessman now!"
Jay laughed despite his mixed feelings about that description. "I should go. Need to finish packing."
"Take pictures of everything! The plane, the hotel, the food, the meeting—I want to live vicariously through your glamorous life!"
By eleven, he was ready—suitcase packed, documents organized, appearance immaculate. Soon Ian would arrive in the company car to collect him, and they'd begin this journey together—their first extended period alone together. Jay was as prepared as he could possibly be.
