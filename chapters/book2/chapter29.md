Chapter 29: Choices
Scene 1
The perfect apartment
Thursday's apartment viewing began with the same cheerfulness the agent had displayed during their previous meeting. His smile was even more pronounced as he guided Jay through the first few properties.
Jay was increasingly confused. The part of the city they were touring wasn't one he would have selected, and the listings were above his stated budget range. When he voiced these concerns, the agent smiled apologetically.
"Your budget can definitely accommodate these options if you're willing to make some concessions. This area is truly worth the sacrifice."
The next listing was less impressive, a cramped space with an impossibly long corridor and a bathroom barely large enough for one person, though it was more reasonably priced.
The agent shook his head with sadness. "Naturally, more modest options are available in this area, but compromises must be made."
They drove further into the district, approaching the river, and Jay began recognizing the surroundings. Ian lived somewhere nearby. They stopped beside a beautiful new building overlooking a charming park and the water beyond.
The agent's smile became positively radiant. "Now this is something special."
The building's interior was tastefully finished, and they rode the elevator to the fourth floor. Following a small corridor, they entered a brand-new unit that took Jay's breath away.
The apartment was fully furnished. The paint scheme featured peaceful, muted earth tones that complemented dark wooden floors throughout. Enormous windows flooded the space with natural light, and a balcony offered spectacular river views.
Despite being compact, the floor plan felt spacious and brilliantly designed. A huge closet was cleverly integrated into the small entryway, maximizing storage without overwhelming the entrance. The bedroom had just enough space for a proper bed and wide closet. The kitchenette was built into the wall, with modern appliances and plenty of counters despite the modest size, and with cupboards extending to the ceiling.
The living room featured a corner couch that looked both stylish and comfortable, a mounted television with a stand holding small plants, and a coffee table that didn't dominate the space. A dining table with four chairs was positioned to stay out of the way while still leaving room for a proper desk and decent-sized bookshelf.
The bathroom impressed Jay most of all. It contained both a walk-in shower and a bathtub, with a washing machine and dryer built into custom paneling that concealed them completely. Multiple drawers extended to the ceiling, providing abundant storage without cluttering the visual space.
The balcony featured an outdoor patio sofa with cushions and a small table perfect for morning coffee. Throughout the apartment, plush rugs and strategically placed plants created an atmosphere that was cosy and welcoming.
Jay walked through the space in awe. Of all the properties he had seen, this one was unquestionably the most beautiful, furnished with brand-new pieces arranged so competently that he wouldn't change a single detail.
The agent began his sales presentation, highlighting every amenity with theatrical gestures.
"Look at this perfectly fitted dishwasher! The cupboards maximize storage capacity beyond what you'd expect for the square meters. Notice how much counter space we've achieved."
He continued his tour with growing excitement. "The corner sofa is impossibly soft yet durable. It opens for emergency sleeping arrangements and could comfortably accommodate three guests. The bedroom closet is enormous, you could easily fit clothes for at least two people!"
Jay had to admit he wasn't exaggerating. Every claim was demonstrably accurate.
"The modern air conditioning utilizes the latest technology. Superior heating and insulation ensures low costs. The parks in this area are magnificent, the one next door is decent sized, and there are two more within walking distance. Multiple cafes and grocery stores nearby, plus two highly regarded restaurants. The metro station is a nine-minute walk, which might not be the most convenient, and it's not on one of the main lines. However, it provides direct service to the financial district, and the route passes through parkland, making it practically a wellness activity!"
The agent was clearly downplaying cons while highlighting pros, and with each sentence Jay became both more charmed and more distrustful. He was starting to suspect either a scam or an astronomical price, so when the agent began another tirade about advanced technologies, Jay gently interrupted.
"What's the price?"
The agent's smile became even more brilliant. "This is a special opportunity exclusively for valued partners at Turner & Associates. Unavailable on the general market, with a personal discount from our agency owner. One and a half million."
It was... suspiciously cheap. Still above Jay's budget of one million plus or minus twenty percent, but potentially manageable if he included his annual bonus. Based on previous presentations, however, properties of this calibre in this location should cost at least twice that amount.
Jay narrowed his eyes. "Was someone murdered here? Is this an unlucky number? Flooding risk?"
The agent looked offended. "Nothing of the sort! I would never compromise my reputation. Ian Hagen himself is guaranteeing my honesty in this transaction."
The mention of Ian was reassuring. Ian had recommended him personally, and no one would dare tarnish his name. But the offer was still not only too good to be true, it seemed like the agent had been building up to this from the beginning.
Jay walked through the apartment two more times. It was beautiful. He could see himself drinking morning coffee on that balcony. There was enough floor space between the living room and entrance to lay down a yoga mat for morning exercise, which he did occasionally but had stopped due to space constraints. He could probably host his entire family if he slept on the floor himself. Ian would have a comfortable place to sleep when he stayed over again...
Wait. He wasn't allowed to think such thoughts.
But speaking of Ian, this was his general area, wasn't it? He'd have to check the map when he got home.
Jay thanked the agent and headed to the metro station, exploring the vicinity. The river was close but situated in a small valley, making flooding unlikely. The park was lovely, with variety of trees and bushes and clearly fresh pavement. Well-dressed people moved about, as expected in such an upscale area, but not to the point of being intimidating.
He entered one of the recommended restaurants and ordered their apparently famous seared trout, which was decent, though Jay wasn't sure it was worth the hype evident from teenagers taking selfies at every second table.
He took the metro home, but it required changing trains in the financial district. This was a further part of town, away from the central metro network he was accustomed to. From his current station, he could take three lines practically halfway across the city. He was quite fond of the convenience, and it was less than five minutes from home.
Returning to his studio, which now looked awfully depressing in comparison, Jay realized the apartment he'd just seen was only eighteen square meters bigger, but seemed twice as spacious. And he'd already thought his studio had pretty well-conceptualized space allocation.
He looked up the area on his city map. Ian lived only a twelve-minute walk away. He could probably see Ian's building if he looked carefully enough.
He sighed heavily. It was too good to be true. It was also outside his financial comfort zone. Admittedly a restrictively tight zone, but he remained cautious about his financial security. And he couldn't shake the feeling that this was another elaborate plot, just like his hiring.
But he couldn't understand what the endgame was supposed to be.
Scene 2
Manipulation
The next morning at work, Jay was still torn about the apartment. During the briefing in Ian's office, as they finished with the day's agenda, Jay hesitated for a moment before leaving, then asked, "Can I take a moment with a personal matter?"
"Naturally," Ian replied.
"How trustworthy is the agent you recommended?"
Ian felt his pulse quicken. "I wouldn't recommend him if I wasn't certain about his reliability. Was there a problem?"
"Not a problem exactly, but he showed me a listing that's ridiculously attractive, half the market price, and it happens to be twelve minutes away from where you live."
Ian's heart skipped a beat. He had instructed the agent that if he could get Jay to move within walking distance, he would be properly rewarded, but to be absolutely discreet about it. Now he feared his frankly elementary scheme was completely transparent.
"The real estate market can be unpredictable. Connections are often half the battle in finding good opportunities," Ian said with forced casualness.
Jay sighed deeply, thinking. "Is it once again my closeness to you propping me up?" He looked at Ian with a slightly miserable expression. "I can't possibly accept sliding on your coattails so much."
Ian tried to control his voice to sound calm and patient. "Your current employment has many demands. Frequent long hours, incredibly stressful periods, constant need for impeccable conduct and presentation, highest standards of performance. But there are also benefits, and the pay is only one of them. Connections come as another, and you're well within your rights to make use of them. That's compensation for the unreasonable requirements."
Jay wasn't entirely convinced, but dropped the subject and returned to work.
During lunch that day, he showed the listing to the whole team, illustrating his concerns. Almost everyone was quite enthusiastic, with Zoe being the most excited.
"It's an absolute steal! You cannot let this offer go," she insisted.
Only Max was visibly less impressed. "It's far too small to live comfortably long-term. You'll outgrow it within a year."
Luc commented diplomatically. "It's quaint, I suppose."
Jay disregarded him completely since his tastes were unorthodox at best. The rest of the team agreed it was a great deal, with Kim being just as suspicious as Jay.
"It's likely Ian's name can open many doors. Being the CFO's assistant is an underrated position. Maybe I should have gone for it as well."
Jay remained undecided. Despite it being Friday and not having many tasks, he stayed late with Ian, mostly browsing different units and comparing prices. For the general area, the price was incredibly low, and places this beautiful were rare on the market.
Ian approached him on the way to coffee, trying to sound casual. "Are you considering the place?"
"I honestly don't know. I have a bad feeling about it, and it's not in my comfortable budget."
"Your comfortable budget is conservative for someone with your salary," Ian remarked.
Jay grew quiet, finally saying, "It's hard for me to get rid of my initial levels of frugality." He didn't want to admit to Ian that he didn't trust the stability of his position.
They went to get coffee, and Ian changed the subject. "Do you have weekend plans?"
"Yeah, I'm going out with Rus."
 "That sounds enjoyable."
While Ian wished him fun, secretly his mood darkened. Jay rarely had plans before, but now it seemed he regularly spent time with his gym trainer turned friend. Ian felt desperate, and before returning to his desk, took a gamble.
"If you want my advice, you should take the apartment. You can afford it, and I can recommend a bank that will give you attractive mortgage conditions."
"I can't possibly impose any more than I already have."
"You not only can, you absolutely should. You've seized every opportunity that presented itself to your advantage and are all the better for it. You should continue to do so. This is the time for you to arrange the life you want to live, so you need to be decisive."
The speech came out more grandiose than intended, but Ian wanted to make his point, to push Jay toward this decision. It felt bitter to be so manipulative, trying to engineer proximity while compromising his own integrity. But his need for Jay was stronger than his discomfort with his methods.
Jay returned to his desk with coffee and more conflicted feelings. He trusted Ian's judgment and knew he was probably right. But Jay wasn’t Ian. Ian was brave, unbreakable. When his life had collapsed once already, he had clawed his way back and rebuilt it from the ashes. Jay knew he couldn’t do that. He was terrified of making a wrong call, of misjudging the situation and making a mistake that would cost him more than he could bear. If he fell, he wouldn’t have the strength to rise again. That fear clung to him, even as he tried to let Ian’s assurance steady him.
The memories of the moment he discovered the circumstances that got him his position surfaced—the humiliation of being used as a pawn, of being the laughingstock of the whole company. It made him stop in his tracks.
Things had turned out okay so far. But had they really? The feeling of playing a role he didn't understand returned, and his wariness skyrocketed.
He could sense the undercurrent of manipulation in the air, subtle but impossible to ignore. Lately, he’d been feeling good, secure. His initial doubts had faded, replaced by a cautious trust in the path unfolding before him. But Jay knew too well that when something felt too good to be true, it always was. There had to be strings attached. He just couldn’t tell who held them, or what end they were pulling toward.
He would have to think about it. Maybe ask other people, make a detailed list, research more. He didn't need to decide right away. There was still time to think it through.
For now, he would go home and consider it. Tomorrow maybe he would consult Rus. At least Rus seemed to have his wellbeing in mind, even if his ideas were sometimes misguided.
Scene 3
Adventures with friends
On Saturday morning, Jay went to the gym as always. Between sets, he asked Rus about his apartment predicament.
"I'm searching for a place to buy because my current rental is tiny. The search was going so-so, but the agent I got introduced to through work is showing me a perfect place that fits my dream vision, for a low price—an absolute steal. It has some minor issues I could potentially overlook, like being on the far end of the city, near the posh heights and away from the center with less convenient metro access. But it feels too good to be true."
Rus pondered this for a moment. "If you move there, you'll stop coming to this gym."
That was true enough—the transit wouldn't be convenient, and Jay would definitely find something closer. He felt connected to his current neighborhood, and uprooting himself held no appeal.
"No matter," Rus continued. "We can still meet outside the gym. You don't really need a trainer anymore—you could manage on your own, you know the drill."
"You motivate me to stay consistent. I don't want to change trainers."
"You shouldn't let the neighborhood tie you down. We can always stay friends and keep in touch outside the gym. It may feel good to stay in the same place, but it can also lead to stagnation. You have a chance to upgrade your life. You got this opportunity through your work and should seize it. At least you'll get something out of all those stressful quarterly periods."
Rus was essentially echoing Ian's advice. Jay thought to himself that naturally Rus would say that—he and Ian were both self-assured men who didn't let doubts or anxieties hold them back.
"The offer feels suspect somehow. Like I'm being given something too good for me, as bait. But I don't understand who would want to bait me, or what for."
"Maybe they want to get in good with that demanding boss of yours."
Jay agreed that would make sense. "But I don't see how pleasing me would win them anything with Ian."
"Maybe they see you as a potential new director and are trying to get in your good graces while you're still green."
Jay laughed. "Don't be ridiculous."
"There, there, don't be so humble. You're Mr. Big Shot now," Rus teased.
Jay sent him an exaggerated murderous look.
"What's the price anyway?" Rus asked.
When Jay told him, Rus was outraged. "That's ridiculously expensive! For a place that small, I could get three flats where I live. That's hardly a good offer. These rich people have warped your understanding and are trying to pull you away from your honest working-class roots."
Jay laughed at Rus's fiery tirade. "The neighborhood is truly posh, and property prices there are steep. But it's nice, with parks and near the river."
Rus grew serious. "You shouldn't overthink this. Sometimes a good deal is just a good deal. I'm sure rich people all get things through deals with each other, and you operate in their world now, so the least you can do is take some of that wealth for us honest folks."
"When I got this really good job, it was also too good to be true. Then I found out it was because of my looks."
Rus roared with laughter. "No wonder! Someone as pretty as you should breeze through life thanks to his face."
Jay's mood dampened, and he sighed in resignation. "That's not true. My looks have only ever brought me trouble."
"It shouldn't be that way. You should enjoy the benefits of being blessed with an appealing appearance. It should bring opportunities, not suffering. It's good to be careful, but you've moved from careful to paranoid. What does Luc say about the apartment?"
"It's way too modest for Luc. He'd never live in something so ordinary."
Rus grinned. "See? That's hardly as good as it seems, barely reaching your current standards."
Jay was still unconvinced, but maybe Rus was right. Maybe he was being too paranoid.
Before leaving, Rus reminded him of their plans. "Wear sportswear, and I'll see you there."
Jay returned home to finish chores and met Rus and his friends at five at the designated location. Rus had taken him to laser tag in an outdoor facility.
Jay spent two hours running around in mud in gloomy autumn drizzle, trying to shoot people with toy guns. It was an absolutely awful experience. When it was over, he was wet, cold, filthy and sore all over. His gym clothes looked ruined.
Everyone else seemed satisfied. Their team had even won despite Jay's abysmal performance, but that did not lift his spirits whatsoever.
He would never take Rus up again on any "fun activities." Between Luc's blind dates and Rus's outdoor exercises, he couldn't decide which was worse, and both had resulted in ruined clothes, though at least gym wear wasn't particularly precious.
He was half minded to call Ian again for rescue, but his filthy clothes would ruin Ian's car, the situation wasn't dire enough and he really didn't want to impose again. He was holding his phone when he got a text from Ian.
"Is the evening better this time?" 
Jay responded honestly: "No, equally miserable. I'm starting to suspect my friends secretly hate me."
Ian called immediately. "Do you need to be picked up?"
Jay laughed despite his poor mood. "No, I'm quite alright. I spent two hours trudging through mud and am filthy and exhausted, but I appreciate you worrying about me. This time the clothes go straight in the bin—no need to worry about emergency cleaning."
"That's good."
Ian wanted to say something more, but mostly was just happy to hear Jay's voice. Jay couldn't know that Ian had spent the whole day in a dejected mood, and really hadn't wanted to send that text, but also couldn't stand the silence of his apartment any longer.
"See you Monday," Jay finally said and hung up.
His mood lifted a bit after talking to Ian. Ian really was the best.
Scene 4
Indecision
Jay woke up aching the next morning. The laser tag adventure had left him sore in muscles he'd forgotten he had. It was Sunday, and to cheer himself up, he decided to do something completely different.
He went into the city for an elaborate breakfast at a fancy restaurant, treating himself to eggs Benedict and fresh pastries. Afterwards, he indulged in a massage at an upscale spa—a full package including hot stones and aromatherapy. He went shopping for new gym clothes to replace the ones ruined by mud, then enjoyed an equally elaborate lunch at a bistro he'd always wanted to try.
He returned home in the afternoon after having splurged uncharacteristically. The entire day had been about shaking things up and recharging, hoping to gain a new perspective on life.
Then he called his mother for advice, laying out his apartment situation much as he had with Rus.
"I'm so proud of how well you're doing. How far you've come from that scared young man who first moved to the city. In the real world, connections are everything. Your stepfather once got a fantastic deal on a car through a friend from work. The city has been good to you—you should follow your heart."
The conversation drifted to Christmas plans, with Jay once again avoiding commitments, just like last year.
"Work is busy, and the apartment hunt on top of it makes it hard to find time. I'll let you know."
"Your siblings will be very disappointed if you skip Christmas two years in a row."
Jay was properly apologetic, but he didn't have the mental capacity to think about holidays right now.
Seeking even more perspectives, Jay walked to Café Lemon, relieved to find Fay working behind the counter. Weekend shifts were always unpredictable.
"How are you feeling? I was sorry to hear you'd been ill."
"Much better, though this weather isn't helping anyone's health," Fay replied, gesturing toward the gloomy windows. "What can I get you?"
"A cappuccino, please. And actually, could I ask your advice about something?"
Jay outlined his apartment dilemma while Fay prepared his drink.
"I'd be sad to see you move from the area, but honestly? You should go for it. You sound like you really like the place, and if things turn sour, you can always sell it. It's not like it's a contract written in blood."
Jay sipped his cappuccino, watching the gloomy weather outside the windows. November had ended, and December should have brought holiday atmosphere. But he didn't feel it this year, and the world outside didn't look festive either. The gray, wet chill permeated everything, mirroring his mood. He had an opportunity to end the year with a major life decision, and it was making him feel scared and uncertain.
At least everyone seemed to be encouraging him to go for the apartment. Maybe they were right, and he was being silly.
In the late afternoon, he traveled to the pool facility he hadn't visited since his vacation, hoping that submerging in water would help him relax. It didn't. He returned home thoroughly spent from what had been a very productive day, but still cooked dinner for the whole week and ate at his small table, looking out the window.
It was quite possible these were his last few months in this apartment. He'd lived here for over six years already. It felt like home, perhaps more so than any other place he'd ever stayed. This apartment had witnessed so much of his struggle, his tears. It felt wrong to leave it behind.
On Monday, he arrived at work feeling melancholy and remained quiet the entire day. Ian noticed and felt guilty, imagining it was his meddling that had upset Jay. He wanted to comfort him somehow but didn't know how to approach it without revealing his involvement.
Jay stayed late to handle tasks that had accumulated over the weekend, and he worked closely with Ian, but barely spoke. Even their evening coffee involved only a perfunctory comment about the weather before Jay returned to his desk.
On Tuesday, Jay left at five, and once again he barely spoke with Ian or anyone else. The distance felt unbearable to Ian, who was missing even their mundane work-related conversations.
The gym session was hard, and Jay struggled to summon his normal energy.
"What's wrong? You look like someone stole your lunch money." Rus asked. 
Jay blamed Saturday evening, pouting. "I'm never going out with you again. That was the opposite of fun."
Rus was highly amused by Jay's complaints. "Alright, alright. Next time we'll figure out something that's fun for everyone. A blind date, maybe?"
Jay threw him a murderous look. "I changed my mind. I'm actually looking forward to my new trainer in the upscale, posh district gym."
Rus was at least relieved that if Jay was in the mood for teasing, it couldn't be anything too serious.
"I'm just torn about moving," Jay admitted. "I'm afraid of it. I like my apartment, it feels like home. I'm used to it, to the area, to the daily commute."
Rus patted him on the back. "You yourself complained that it's small and cramped and outdated. Can you imagine living that way forever, always having to make compromises? It's understandable to be afraid, but you shouldn't let nostalgia be your prison. No matter how much you like your current place, you'll like the new one even more."
The next day at work, Jay planned to leave at five for his scheduled vaccinations. His team members approved, most had already gotten theirs or were planning to soon. Only Kim was nonchalant about it.
"I never get sick," Kim declared.
Max rolled his eyes. "Wait until you reach my age."
Ela sighed heavily, looking at Kim with disapproval. Jay later heard her complaining to Amy about his childishness and wondered if they were heading into an awkward period of couple bickering. That was always uncomfortable to witness.
The vaccination was straightforward, so Jay arrived home at a reasonable hour and spent the entire evening browsing listings. He selected another set of apartments to tour, this time in the general area where the mysterious perfect apartment was located.
He called the agent the next day. "You can come see them this very afternoon," she said enthusiastically.
Jay left at five once again, to Ian's growing dismay. Ian felt like he barely got any time alone with Jay these days, and just seeing him during work hours was hardly enough. It only made him long for more.
Jay toured the area despite the awful weather. It was gloomy, wet, and gray, but the neighbourhood still looked nice. There were no run-down properties, everything was well maintained, and shops had holiday decorations up. He was impressed, though the places themselves were way above his budget, larger than he preferred, and all were very nice.
Jay asked numerous questions about the area, trying to get a feel for it, and the agent was accommodating. Jay had lied that his budget was five million, and maybe he even looked the part, because the agent never doubted his story. It was still hard to believe he was even in a position to consider such neighbourhoods.
On Friday, Jay again prepared to leave work at five. There really wasn't much to do, and he didn't feel like staying, his mood remaining low. As he packed his things, Ian came out of his office.
"Is everything alright? You seem under the weather these days."
"The apartment search is stressing me out. It's a big decision. Nothing you should worry about."
But Ian did worry. "Is there anything I can do?"
Jay shook his head and left, leaving Ian with his concern and guilt.
Ian really was such a kind and upstanding man, always ensuring team morale stayed high. Jay was sure Ian wouldn't fret over something so mundane, but he couldn't help himself. He spent the weekend touring the city, just looking at neighbourhoods, trying to sort his thoughts out.
Scene 5
Christmas trees
The annual Christmas tree decoration event was evident the moment Jay stepped into the office on Monday, which was filled with the scent of pine. The building lobby was already fully decorated, with a huge tree standing in the center. This year their workspace had two impressive, thick, fragrant evergreens.
Jay approached one of the trees, running his fingers along the branches, and soon Ian joined him.
"This year, in order to satisfy both camps, we're simply going to have two trees. The annual argument about decorating philosophy has become quite the tradition."
The eternal debate between Team Max, preferring gaudy chaos, and Team Amy, advocating for tasteful choices, was indeed legendary.
When decorating time arrived after lunch, excitement filled the air as colleagues joined their preferred aesthetic camps. Huge boxes of ornaments, garlands, and decorating supplies appeared as if by magic. Ela and Kim joined Team Max, while Zoe and Luc aligned themselves with Team Amy.
That left Ian and Jay to choose sides, ensuring the numbers remained even. Last year they had decorated together, and Jay was disappointed they were supposed to join different teams this year, though he tried not to show it.
"I'll go with Team Max," Jay announced, forcing brightness into his voice. "Less pressure to perform."
Ian nodded and moved toward Team Amy's tree. "That leaves me here, then."
Naturally, Max's tree became absolutely ridiculous, with every color imaginable and far too many garlands, while Team Amy, with Ian's contribution, produced a beautiful blue and gold composition. Each team looked pleased with their results, except Jay, who had enjoyed last year's collaborative effort much more.
Ian was frustrated as well, but he didn't show it at all, seeming perfectly content. But secretly, he was already plotting a solution to salvage what he most wanted from this tradition.
He had ordered another small tree to be placed in his office. He'd never had a tree in his office before, but he wanted to decorate with Jay. He remembered last year's joy, Jay's carefree smiles as they wrapped garland together. He'd looked forward to the event and hadn't expected his plan would backfire so spectacularly. He'd hoped fewer people per tree would make it more intimate, and not separate them.
Since it was Monday and there were always more tasks, Jay traditionally stayed late, tackling the weekend backlog of client correspondence. As everyone left, a man came maneuvering a smaller but beautifully shaped Christmas tree into Ian's office.
"I didn't expect you to want an additional tree," Jay commented, watching the setup process.
"I thought some festivity would be good for once," Ian replied, then asked nonchalantly, "Would you like to help decorate?"
Jay's mood lifted immediately. "I'll fetch the ornament boxes."
When Jay returned with supplies, Ian gestured toward the tree. "You can choose the color scheme."
"That's too much responsibility," Jay protested, slightly intimidated by the prospect of disappointing Ian with poor choices.
"What are your favorite colors?" Ian asked.
Jay was stumped. He'd never really thought about it. "I'm not sure I have definitive favorites."
"Then we'll each pick one color and try to create something cohesive from that."
Jay looked at the available ornaments, drawn to the gold options. They reminded him of Ian's hair in afternoon sunlight, though he would never voice such a thought. "Gold, I think."
"Silver," Ian replied, thinking of Jay's gray eyes catching light during their morning conversations.
They worked together, Jay following Ian's lead in spacing and proportion. The result was monochromatic but charming and quite elegant.
Jay then surprisingly proposed, "Should we add some red accents? To make it more festive?"
They hung a few more baubles, and the final effect was more sophisticated and warm. Jay stepped back to admire their collaboration.
"I'm not sure I'll bother with a personal tree at home this year," Jay said with a heavy sigh. "My apartment is cramped enough without adding an entire pine tree. It's a shame, last year's decorations will go unused."
"Are you still hesitating about the new apartment?"
Jay nodded. "That mysteriously perfect place has ideal space for a tree next to the desk in the living room. Would be exactly right for decorating."
"You certainly evaluated it thoroughly."
"Yeah, I took plenty of photos from every angle. I like it, I really do, but I'm scared of the commitment, of what it represents, of uprooting myself. And worse, of playing right into some scheme I don't understand."
Ian felt guilty. He was right that his meddling was causing Jay distress. He tried to untangle it somewhat, coming clean to a degree without revealing exactly how much he'd pressured the agent.
"I should clarify something. It's partially my fault that the agent was so enthusiastic. I asked him to prioritize finding you an exceptional deal, and he clearly took that request very seriously. You shouldn't feel burdened by his eagerness. That was never my intention. If you're uncomfortable, you should walk away. I can find another agent without briefing them about anything specific. Or you can continue searching independently. There's no deadline pressure, take whatever time you need until something feels exactly right."
Jay was relieved at least there was no elaborate conspiracy, just Ian's influence opening doors more widely than expected. But the underlying fear remained.
"While that's reassuring, it doesn't address my deeper anxiety about leaving the one place where I feel completely safe," Jay admitted.
Ian should have offered a reassuring speech, but instead diffused with humor. "I cannot relate to that sentiment at all. When the time came to leave my cramped studio behind, I had never felt more relieved. That place was essentially a prison cell that I frankly despised."
Jay laughed despite his mood. "I actually enjoy my studio. I specifically paid premium rent to live somewhere that felt cozy, even if objectively small."
"Different perspectives on confined spaces, clearly."
"I guess I'll postpone this choice until after Christmas. New Year seems like an appropriate moment for major life changes. For now, I need to decide whether I'm going home for the holidays. I skipped last year and my mother was quite displeased."
"I thought you had a good relationship with your family."
"During Christmas, my stepfather's parents always visit, and they're not particularly fond of me. They're not outright mean, but there's always tension. At best they treat me like I'm not there, at worst they actively try to chase me off. It's not that big a deal, they're strangers after all, and I have no relationship with them. But it still feels awkward."
"Then you definitely shouldn't go. Christmas is supposed to be pleasant. I'll invent some urgent project that requires your attention over the holidays."
"I'd appreciate that. Though I'm not sure I'm looking forward to another Christmas alone. What are your holiday plans? And if you say work, I'll be forced to take disciplinary action."
Ian replied deadpan, "Work."
Jay shot him a pointed look. "Do I need to once again insert myself into your schedule just to prevent you from spending Christmas reviewing spreadsheets?"
"I'd like that. I don't look forward to solitary holidays either. I typically work excessively during that period just to avoid thinking about... other things."
"Alright then. I'll come over and we'll prepare a proper Christmas feast together."
"That sounds like an excellent arrangement."
Suddenly, the gloomy December evening felt brighter. The small tree in Ian's office seemed to glow more warmly than any other, and Jay decided this might be his favorite Christmas decoration after all.
