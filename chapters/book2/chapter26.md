Chapter 26: Uncharted territories
Scene 1
Return
Jay pushed through the building's glass doors at exactly seven-thirty Monday morning, his steps quickening as he approached the elevator. Returning to work felt like slipping into comfortable clothes after a week of formal attire. But it wasn't the office itself that drew him forward with such anticipation.
The elevator doors opened to reveal the thirty-fourth floor, most desks still empty, computers dark. But through the glass wall of Ian's office, Jay could see exactly what he had hoped for: Ian already at his desk, immaculately dressed, his blonde hair perfectly styled, completely absorbed in reading a document.
A wave of blissful calm washed over him, so profound it stopped him mid-step. The vacation had been wonderful, the diving exhilarating, the warm beaches restorative, but none of it compared to this moment of seeing Ian in his natural environment, focused and commanding and absolutely perfect. Nothing brought Jay the deep contentment he felt simply looking at Ian again.
Jay stood frozen for a moment, drinking in the sight with fresh eyes. Everything about Ian seemed more vivid after a week away: the lines of his face, the elegance of his movements as he turned pages. Being close to him again felt like coming home in the truest sense.
Jay felt even more awestruck than during their first meeting, when Ian had been too intimidating to properly appreciate. Now that same perfection felt comforting, like the fixed point around which everything else in his life had learned to orbit.
Jay moved to his own desk, unpacking his bag and powering up his computer. When he glanced up to see Ian setting aside his document and stretching slightly, Jay didn't hesitate.
He knocked on Ian's door frame. "Good morning."
Ian's face softened the moment he saw Jay. "Jay. Welcome back. How was the trip?"
"Incredible." Jay stepped into the office, closing the door behind him out of habit and sitting in the chair in front of Ian's desk. The early morning privacy felt precious, a gift of uninterrupted time together.  "The diving was everything I hoped it would be. Got my open water certification, saw some amazing marine life. The water was so clear you could see thirty meters in any direction."
"The diving went well then?"
"Better than I hoped. I actually felt competent by the end. It's amazing how different it feels when you're not fighting panic."
"You look well. Rested."
"I feel good. It was exactly what I needed."
"I'm glad to hear it. Thank you for the postcard."
Jay followed Ian's gesture toward the calendar on his desk, where his tropical postcard was pinned among important dates and meeting reminders. It made his heart flutter, but he tried not to show it. He hadn't expected Ian to display it so publicly.
"What about your time off? Did you manage to do anything interesting?" Jay asked.
"Not much, really. Catching up on personal matters."
"Come on, you had a full week. You must have done something besides household chores."
"I drove to see some old university friends and did some walking around the old campus. Nothing too exciting."
Jay sensed something held back in Ian's response, but the details mattered less than the reassurance that Ian had taken time for himself. "I'm glad you did something relaxing. You work too hard."
"Pot calling the kettle black," Ian replied with a crooked smile.
"Fair point." Jay got up, recognizing that other staff would begin arriving soon and their private time would end. "I should let you get back to your reading. I've got a pile of November assignments waiting."
"It's good to have you back, Jay."
"It's good to be back."
Ian watched Jay return to his desk through his office window, while his heart performed acrobatics that would have been embarrassing in a teenager, let alone a thirty-nine-year-old executive.
Seeing Jay again had unlocked something in his chest that he had spent a week trying to suppress. Jay looked radiant and happy, and it made Ian's emotional walls feel like tissue paper. The tan suited him, and there was an ease in his movements that made him look even more alluring.
Ian had arrived at the office at six-thirty, telling himself it was to catch up on work that had accumulated during his absence. The real reason was more pathetic: he wanted to maximize every possible moment with Jay, and arriving early meant an extra hour of shared space before their colleagues arrived to dilute his attention.
When he had found Jay's postcard in his mail pile, the phrase "wish you were here" had made his heart leap with ridiculous hope. He knew it was standard postcard language, meaningless and automatic. But he had pinned it to his calendar anyway, and spent far too much time staring at Jay's handwriting and imagining what it would mean if those words were honest.
Now Jay was here, and Ian could finally breathe properly again. He hadn't fully recognized how suffocating the week without him had been until it ended.
He had lied about his vacation. There had been no friends, no social catching up. He had driven to his university town alone, seeking distraction from the constant ache of Jay's absence. He had walked the streets, sat in cafes where he had once studied, visited the library where he had spent countless hours as a student.
The melancholy hadn't provided the escape he had hoped for. Instead, it had brought clarity. There was no point in fighting the current. He was in love with Jay and no amount of emotional discipline was going to change that reality.
What he could control was how he handled that love. He would find ways to spend time with Jay without making him uncomfortable. He would provide support and mentorship and whatever else Jay needed, regardless of how inappropriate his motivations might be. He would cross whatever lines necessary to ensure Jay felt valued and secure. He was done pretending that spending time with Jay wasn't the driving force behind most of his decisions.
It wasn't a sustainable long-term strategy, but it was all he had. And watching Jay sit back at his desk, organize his files, Ian decided this was what he wanted. Having Jay here, under his care, was worth whatever personal cost it demanded.
The elevator chimed, signaling the arrival of their first colleague. Their private time was ending, but Jay was back, and that was everything Ian needed to face another day of pretending. He turned back to his documents, already planning how to create more opportunities for their conversations.
The office filled around eight-thirty, and the morning's peace gave way to the bustle of a workday. Jay told stories about his trip, particularly to Zoe.
"Did you see any parrotfish? They're incredible to watch when they're feeding on coral."
"Several different species. And the photos I took don't do them justice, but I managed to capture a few decent shots."
"The underwater camera worked well then?"
"Better than expected. I was worried I'd be too clumsy with the controls, but it became easier after the first few dives."
Luc appeared beside them. "Look at you, all tanned and seasoned. Like a proper adventurer instead of our pale office drone."
For once, the comment about his appearance didn't make Jay self-conscious. "I do feel different. More capable, maybe."
"It shows. You look like someone who conquered something important."
"I did. The whole solo travel thing felt impossible when I first started planning it, but by the end I was enjoying the independence."
"Good for you. Nothing like proving to yourself you can handle whatever you set your mind to."
Luc was right. Jay had proven something important to himself during the past week, and returning to the office felt like bringing that new confidence with him.
Scene 2
Evening chat
Lunch at the nearby restaurant became an extended celebration of Jay's successful diving adventure. Luc and Zoe flanked him at their table, asking follow-up questions that kept the conversation animated throughout the meal.
"So the visibility was really that clear? You could see the bottom even at fifteen meters?" Zoe asked.
"Crystal clear. Like swimming in an aquarium, except everything was real and alive. The fish weren't afraid of divers at all. Some of them would swim right up to the camera. The colours were so much more vivid in person."
Zoe nodded knowingly. "The camera never captures it properly. That's why I always tell people the real experience is worth ten times more than any documentation."
Jay talked eagerly, the memory of his adventure still fresh enough to spark excitement. Both his colleagues seemed pleased by his enthusiasm, asking detailed questions about the specific dive sites he had visited.
The afternoon passed productively as Jay worked through his post-vacation backlog, but it was the late coffee break that made an ordinary day more memorable. What started as a brief kitchen encounter stretched into an extended conversation that seemed to take on a life of its own. Jay sat at the tall stool by the window table while Ian stood against the wall, both of them quickly getting lost in the discussion.
"The solitary walks were my favourite part. There's something exhilarating about exploring a new place entirely at your own pace, following whatever catches your interest."
"That sounds appealing. No schedules, no obligations to anyone else's preferences."
"Yeah. I'd wander into the town in the evenings, just observing how different everything felt. The architecture, the way people moved, even the quality of light was different."
Ian asked questions that drew out more details, seeming interested in Jay's observations about cultural differences and the contrast between tropical warmth and their current November chill.
"Coming back to falling leaves and cold mornings was jarring. Though not unpleasant. Just a reminder that I need to get serious about practical things again," Jay admitted.
"Such as?"
"The apartment search, mainly. I've been putting it off, but with winter coming and my living situation getting more cramped by the month, I really need to focus on finding something better."
"Have you started looking at specific units?"
"Not really. I keep telling myself I'll start, but then work gets busy or I get distracted by other things."
"What kind of space are you hoping to find?"
"Something larger, obviously. Maybe a proper bedroom instead of just a studio layout. Better kitchen facilities would be nice too. I've gotten tired of cooking everything in a single small pan."
Ian asked about Jay's timeline, his budget and commute considerations, discussed the neighbourhood characteristics and the pros and cons of older buildings versus modern construction, and Jay elaborated on details he hadn't fully articulated to himself before. Ian's questions prompted Jay to explore his own thoughts about what kind of home he wanted to create.
Finally Jay checked his watch and discovered with surprise that nearly an hour had passed. "I should probably get back to work though. I was hoping to make more progress on the backlog tonight."
"Of course. Though it was good to hear about your trip in detail."
Jay returned to his desk energized by the unexpected conversation. The tasks felt less tedious, and they continued to work until nearly ten o'clock. It wasn't strictly necessary, the backlog could have easily waited until tomorrow. But the shared late-evening felt less like work and more like a long awaited social call. As they finally prepared to leave, Jay hadn't minded the extended hours at all. If anything, the evening had felt too short.
Tuesday evening was Ian's least favourite part of Jay's weekly routine. At exactly five o'clock, Jay began shutting down his computer and gathering his belongings.
"Gym night?" Ian asked, though he already knew the answer.
"Six o'clock session with Rus. Haven't seen him since before the vacation, so I'm expecting some commentary about my tan."
Ian managed what he hoped was an appropriately encouraging smile. "I'm sure he'll be pleased you stayed active during your time away."
"We'll see. He tends to find something to critique regardless."
Jay headed home to change, leaving Ian alone in the office with his increasingly irrational resentment toward a personal trainer he had never met. The logical part of his mind recognized that Jay's fitness routine was healthy and important, that Rus was helping Jay build physical strength that benefited every aspect of his life.
The less logical part wanted to throttle anyone who commanded Jay's time and attention outside of work hours.
Ian sat in his office, staring at nothing in particular, contemplating his emotions. He needed Jay closer, in every possible sense. The apartment search Jay had mentioned presented an opportunity, and Ian was already mentally reviewing his contacts in real estate circles.
It was manipulative, he knew that. Jay deserved to find housing based on his own preferences and needs, not Ian's desire to engineer proximity. But helping someone find a better living situation was hardly villainous, even if his motives were entirely selfish.
He wouldn't coerce Jay into anything he didn't want. But perhaps he could ensure that Jay's options included some attractive possibilities in neighbourhoods that happened to be convenient to Ian's own life. Surely there were agents who valued his gratitude above strict profit considerations.
At the gym, Jay threw himself into his workout with vigour. Rus looked at him with approval.
"You look healthy. The week away obviously agreed with you."
"I stayed more active than I expected. Lots of swimming and walking."
"Good. Vacations are important, but I was worried you'd come back completely deconditioned. How do you feel? Any lingering fatigue from the travel?"
"I feel great. More energetic than before I left."
"That's what a proper break should do. Your body had time to recover from all that work stress."
The session proceeded smoothly, with Jay finding his strength and endurance largely intact. After he was done, Rus praised both his consistency and his approach to maintaining fitness during travel.
"You're turning into a real athlete. Remember when you first came in here, all nervous and apologetic about everything?"
Jay laughed, toweling off his face. "I was convinced I'd embarrass myself completely."
"Now look at you. Confident, strong, adventurous.  You're almost unrecognizable after less than six months."
On his way home, Jay stopped at Café Lemon, craving the comfort of the place after a good workout. The evening shift usually meant Fay would be behind the counter, but tonight a different barista greeted him.
"Is Fay not working tonight?" Jay asked as he ordered hot chocolate.
"She's been out sick for a few days. Flu season's hitting everyone early this year."
Jay accepted his drink with disappointment. Fay had become part of the cafe's charm, and her absence made it feel slightly less congenial. Still, the atmosphere remained welcoming, and he had time to sit and enjoy the ambience properly.
As he sipped his drink, Jay made a mental note to schedule his flu vaccination soon. The last thing he wanted was to repeat last winter's bout of illness, especially with the apartment search ahead.
There was a sharp chill in the air as Jay walked home from the café, a reminder that winter was approaching fast. He reheated leftover curry and, on impulse, decided to call his family. The guilt about the curt dismissal during the quarterly reports had been nagging at him since the last time he spoke to them.
"So tell us everything. Your postcard made it sound incredible," his mother's voice came through clearly as the family gathered around their phone. 
Jay launched into a story of his adventures, focusing on the diving experiences and cultural observations while ignoring the more solitary aspects of his vacation.
"It sounds like exactly what you needed. You seem more relaxed," his mother said warmly.
"I feel it too. Though I'm back to reality now. Long hours supporting my boss through the busy periods."
"This boss of yours. You always talk about him with such... admiration. Is he really as wonderful as you make him sound?" Ema interjected with obvious curiosity.
Jay felt heat rise in his cheeks, though thankfully no one could see his reaction. "Ian is... yes, he really amazing. The best person I've ever worked for, probably the best person I know."
"He must be something special to earn that kind of loyalty from you."
"He very much is the greatest," Jay said simply, meaning every word.
The call ended with promises to stay in better touch. As he hung up, Jay thought he had missed the uncomplicated comfort of family connection. Outside, the November wind rattled his windows, but Jay felt unusually warm.
Scene 3
Planning activities
The rest of the week was filled with overtime as lingering issues from their time off surfaced alongside some procedural complications. Nothing required emergency treatment or the full team's attention, but enough accumulated to keep Jay consistently busy past normal hours.
Their evening coffee conversations continued, though briefer than Monday's extended discussion. By Thursday, they were wrapping up work closer to eight o'clock, without the marathon sessions that characterized crisis situations.
Colleagues gathered their belongings and made weekend plans on Friday afternoon, when Luc appeared at Jay's desk with his customary invitation.
"Drinks tonight? That new place downtown has decent cocktails and terrible music, which is somehow exactly what I need right now."
Jay shook his head apologetically. "Can't tonight. Ian and I are staying late to deal with a compliance request."
"You know, you could occasionally prioritize fun over paperwork."
Jay was about to deflect with an excuse when Luc's expression turned more pointed.
"Speaking of fun, remember when you got back from your business trip? You were feeling all confident and proposed we do something different and exciting to cheer me up after the Cam situation?"
Jay felt his stomach drop slightly. He had completely forgotten making that promise, though he vaguely recalled feeling uncharacteristically bold about social planning during those post-trip days.
"Right," Jay said carefully. "That."
"I'm holding you to it. I've been patient, but it's time to deliver on your mysterious plans."
"Of course. I'll... think of something."
Luc grinned and headed toward the elevator, leaving Jay to contemplate his complete lack of ideas about novel entertainment options.
The compliance issue was less time-consuming than anticipated, and by six o'clock they had resolved it entirely. Instead of heading to the kitchen for the coffee, Jay knocked on Ian's office door.
"Do you have a minute? I need some advice about something non-work related."
"What's on your mind?"
"I promised Luc I'll organize something fun and different for him when I was feeling confident after our trip. Well, I completely forgot about it until today, and he's calling it in. I have absolutely no idea what constitutes fun and different entertainment. My idea of leisure is reading at home."
"What kind of activity are you thinking? Something active, social, cultural?"
"I honestly don't know. Something that would cheer him up and get him away from the Friday night bar routine."
"Fencing," Ian said.
"I'm sorry, what?"
"Fencing. It's unusual, physically engaging, and most people find it surprisingly enjoyable once they try it."
Jay began laughing at the complete unexpectedness of the suggestion. "That's completely bonkers. Are you seriously suggesting I invite Luc to hit people with swords?"
"It's more sophisticated than that, but essentially yes. I tried it briefly in college. It can be quite enjoyable. Good exercise, requires focus and strategy."
"That's..." Jay paused, still grinning. "That's completely unorthodox. Where did that even come from?"
"I'm not exactly known for spontaneous entertainment planning. If you want truly creative ideas, you'd probably need to consult actual experts in that area."
"Who would those experts be?"
"Leo, obviously. He has extensive experience organizing social activities."
The mention of Leo's name immediately dampened Jay's mood. Ian noticed the change immediately. "Are you still resentful about the tailor appointment?"
"I'm resentful about everything," Jay replied sulkily.
"He can be mischievous, I'll grant you that. But his intentions are good, and he does tend to have excellent ideas for entertainment. He knows how to create memorable experiences."
Jay remained unconvinced. "I'd rather have nothing to do with Leo at all. Maybe I'll actually do the fencing thing instead."
The defeat in his voice was obvious, and Ian felt a little guilty for not being more helpful.
"Since it's Friday and we've finished the urgent matters, should we call it a day? You've been putting in long hours all week, and proper rest is beneficial," Jay asked, suddenly eager to change the subject.
Ian wanted nothing more than to stay longer, to find excuses that would extend their time together before the weekend separated them entirely. But he knew it was unfair to keep Jay at work solely for his own emotional needs.
"You're right. It has been a long week."
They gathered their things and headed for the elevator together, with Ian concealing his disappointment at ending what could have been at least two more hours of shared work.
Jay spent the evening researching fencing options on his new laptop. To his surprise, he discovered several beginner-friendly facilities offering group packages designed for people with no experience.
One option caught his attention: "introductory combat sports for absolute beginners", that promised to accommodate complete novices with safety equipment and patient instructors. Without overthinking the absolute absurdity of what he was doing, Jay booked it for the following Friday afternoon.
The rest of the weekend passed on exercise, walks, and household maintenance. He also spent time browsing apartment listings, though his home internet made the process frustratingly slow. Even the powerful new laptop couldn't compensate for the sluggish connection, and Jay stared at the machine with guilt.
"You're really wasted on someone like me," he said aloud to the laptop, unable to shake the sense that he wasn't utilizing such an expensive gift properly. He compiled a list of potential viewings with the intention of calling agents during the upcoming week, finally ready to take his housing search seriously.
When Luc joined him for coffee on Monday morning, Jay decided to address the entertainment situation directly.
"I booked an activity for Friday."
Luc's interest immediately sparked. "Really? What kind of activity?"
"Fencing."
Luc's face went through several expressions in rapid succession. "You want us to hit each other with swords?"
"More like poke each other with sticks, from what I understand. But yes, basically. I booked a group package, so we can invite the rest of the team or you could bring your flatmates or other friends."
"You know what? I'd rather keep this separate from work. Make it a purely social thing. I'll bring my flatmates, but you need to bring people too. How many spots do we have?"
"I... don't really have other friends to invite."
"Come on, there must be someone."
"I'll figure something out," Jay promised, though he had no idea how.
The solution presented itself unexpectedly on Tuesday afternoon at the gym. As Jay finished his session, he approached Rus with what felt like a ridiculous request.
"This might sound strange, but would you be interested in joining me and some friends for a... recreational activity this Friday?"
"What kind of activity?"
"Fencing. Like, with swords."
Rus's face lit up with unexpected enthusiasm. "Are you serious? That sounds amazing! I've always wanted to try melee combat sports."
"Really?"
"Absolutely. How many people can you bring?"
"Three spots available."
"Perfect. I'll bring a couple of friends. What's your number? I'll coordinate with my guys," Rus was already pulling out his phone. 
They exchanged contact information, and Jay provided the details, relieved by Rus's eagerness.
"This is going to be amazing. You're full of surprises, Jay."
The turn of events felt surreal—Jay was apparently developing an actual friendship with his trainer and committing to an evening of recreational sword fighting.
On Wednesday morning Jay informed Luc that their social experiment was officially happening. His response was suspiciously militant.
"Wait, so now we have two teams? Your gym friends versus my flatmates?"
"I suppose that's one way to look at it."
"This just became a lot more interesting. We have to make it a proper competition now."
Jay watched Luc's growing excitement with mounting anxiety. What had started as a desperate attempt to fulfil a forgotten promise was evolving into something much more elaborate than he had ever intended.
During their evening coffee in the kitchen, Jay confessed his growing anxiety to Ian while slumping slightly in his chair by the kitchen window.
"I've created a monster. What started as a simple activity has turned into a competitive social event, and now I feel completely foolish about the whole enterprise."
Ian regarded him with an expressions that Jay couldn't quite parse. "Why foolish?"
"Because it's absurd. I don't know anything about fencing, I barely know Luc's friends, and I'm about to spend an evening watching people hit each other with medieval weapons because I couldn't think of anything better."
"It sounds like you've successfully organized the novel entertainment Luc was hoping for."
"I've never held a sword in my life, and now I'm apparently leading a team into recreational combat."
Ian's response was solemn. "You'll have to endure it for the sake of your heartbroken colleague. Perhaps take a few hits for the cause."
Jay rolled his eyes dramatically. "You're enjoying my suffering. Heartless."
"I prefer to think of it as character building through adversity."
“Absolutely heartless,” Jay repeated, pouting as he returned to his desk with a defeated posture.
Thursday morning at ten o'clock, during a lull in the office coffee rotation, Jay finally made the calls he had been postponing. He contacted several real estate agents and scheduled apartment viewings for the following week. Time to get serious about the apartment search, he thought. But first, he needed to survive Friday's fencing adventure.
Scene 4
Melee combat
Jay rushed home from work on Friday, barely managing to change clothes and grab a quick dinner before meeting his team at the designated spot near the gym. He had arranged to meet Rus and his friends at six-thirty, allowing time to get acquainted before the main event.
The taxi ride to the fencing studio provided Jay's first proper introduction to Rus's companions. Mic, another trainer from the same gym, was someone Jay recognized from brief glimpses during his sessions, stocky and obviously strong, with a confident bearing. Van was more intimidating, tall enough that he had to fold himself into the taxi and built like he could lift a car if necessary.
"So how do you know Rus?" Jay asked.
"Mic and I met at the gym. Van and I go way back. We're military buddies," Rus explained. 
"Military? I had no idea."
Van grinned. "Yeah, Rus never mentions it because it was boring as hell. All that training and we never got to use any proper melee weapons. Biggest disappointment of his military career."
"That's why tonight is going to be perfect. Finally get to swing some steel around," Rus added with enthusiasm.
They arrived at the fencing studio to find Luc and his flatmates already waiting outside, and Luc's excitement was immediately evident.
"There they are! Ready for battle?" Luc called out as they approached.
Jay was introduced to three young men who had the bearing of people accustomed to success. Roc, Gav, and Lim, though Jay suspected he would struggle to keep their names straight, all seemed excited about the prospect of recreational combat.
Within minutes of entering the studio, Jay discovered that his role as organizer was entirely superfluous. The two groups converged on the staff, quickly establishing the parameters of their competition while Jay watched with growing bemusement.
"Team competition, losers buy drinks for the winners all evening," Luc declared, and both sides agreed immediately.
Jay's heart sank when one of Luc's flatmates mentioned having done fencing in college.
"I promise I'll cover any costs we incur tonight," Jay said quietly to Rus. "I don't want your friends dealing with unexpected expenses because of my idea."
"Nonsense," Rus replied confidently. "We're going to destroy them. Van here is a natural athlete, and I've got strategy."
The instructor provided basic safety equipment and fundamental techniques, but it quickly became clear that both teams were more interested in competition. Soon they were facing off in proper duels, with everyone fighting everyone else across sixteen total matches.
Jay's performance was spectacularly abysmal. He lost every single match, often within the first thirty seconds, completely outclassed by opponents who grasped the basics far more quickly than he did. His sword work resembled flailing more than fencing, and by his fourth consecutive defeat, he had accepted his role as the evening's primary source of entertainment.
However, the rest of his team was devastatingly effective. Mic and Rus, despite being complete beginners, adapted quickly to the sport's demands. Van emerged as an absolute phenomenon, his combination of reach, speed, and tactical thinking making him unbeatable. Even Lim, with his college experience, only managed victory against Mic and Rus, while losing to Van.
When the scores were tallied, Jay's team had won decisively despite his perfect losing record. Luc's team looked shell-shocked by the defeat, though they maintained good humour about their poor performance.
"At least Jay was worse than all of us," Luc said consolingly to his flatmates. "That's something."
Jay accepted this dubious distinction with grace, pleased that everyone else seemed to be enjoying themselves despite the lopsided results.
The promised drinks at a nearby pub were more enjoyable than the fencing itself. Luc and his friends honoured their agreement to cover the tab, and the evening turned into boisterous storytelling about the night's more memorable moments.
"Did you see Luc trip over his own feet fighting Van?" Gav recounted with delight. "Went down like a felled tree."
"What about when Rus tried to tackle Lim?" Mic added. "Pure aggression, zero technique. Beautiful to watch."
Jay held a single beer while the others drank with more enthusiasm. When pressed to keep up with the group's consumption, he demurred with honest self-assessment.
"I'm terrible with alcohol in general. I have to pace myself if I want to function tomorrow."
Rus, who had been matching drinks with Van and Mic, immediately began intercepting attempts to press more alcohol on Jay. "Leave him alone. Someone needs to stay coherent enough to get us home."
The gesture touched Jay. Despite barely knowing him outside the gym, Rus was looking out for him without being asked.
The conversation flowed well between the two teams. Rus, Mic, and Van represented a more working-class, downtown sensibility, while Luc's flatmates embodied the polished professionalism of young finance workers, yet the shared experience of getting beaten up had created an unexpected bond.
Stories grew louder and more exaggerated as the evening progressed. Jay laughed at retellings of his own spectacular failures, no longer embarrassed by his complete lack of sword-fighting aptitude. The good-natured teasing never turned mean-spirited, and both groups were content with how the evening had unfolded.
They finally parted ways after two in the morning, with everyone except Jay thoroughly intoxicated. They rode a taxi back to their neighbourhood, with stops to drop off Mic and Van at their respective homes before Rus insisted on escorting Jay to his apartment building.
"That was fun," Rus said as they stood outside Jay's door. "Thanks for thinking of me."
"I'm glad I did. You and your friends made the evening work."
"Van's going to be talking about this for months. He loves any excuse to prove he's the most physically capable person in the room."
Jay fumbled with his keys, the combination of exhaustion and alcohol making fine motor control challenging. "You seemed like you enjoyed it too."
"Absolutely. We should do more things like this, group activities that get everyone moving."
"I'll keep that in mind for future social planning disasters."
Rus laughed and waited until Jay successfully unlocked his door before heading back to the waiting taxi.
Jay stumbled into his apartment, too tired and drunk to manage more than removing his shoes before collapsing onto his bed fully clothed. The evening had been far more successful than he had dared hope.
Scene 5
House hunting
Saturday's gym session was filled with suffering. Jay arrived looking worn out and moving sluggishly.
"You look like hell," Rus said, though his own appearance wasn't particularly fresh either.
Jay yawned widely before answering. "I'm not built for staying out past midnight."
"Fair enough. Let's take it easy today."
Rus mercifully adjusted the workout to accommodate their fatigue, choosing exercises that were almost leisurely. Jay moved through the sets slowly, his body protesting each movement while his mind processed the previous evening's unexpected social success.
They parted ways with promises of future adventures, though Jay suspected his next social planning venture would involve less alcohol consumption.
Jay arrived at work at his usual time on Monday morning. The weekend's adventure had left him sore, but with a sense of accomplishment.
"You look like someone who had an interesting weekend," Ian observed when Jay appeared in his office for their morning briefing.
"That's one way to put it. The fencing experiment was... educational."
"How educational?"
"I lost every single match. Spectacularly. But everyone else seemed to have a wonderful time, so I'm calling it a success."
Ian tried to hide amusement. "Your team-building exercise involved duels?"
"It turned into a proper competition between Luc's flatmates and my gym friends. Luc's team got absolutely destroyed, which somehow made everyone bond over shared humiliation. The evening ended with drinks and war stories about our various defeats."
"And you survived this social experiment?"
"More than survived. I think I might actually have made some real friends. Rus and his military buddy Van were good company, and even Luc's flatmates turned out to be decent people once you get past the yuppie exterior."
"It sounds like you've developed friendships outside of work."
"I think so. Rus is a solid guy. He looked out for me when everyone was trying to get me to drink more than I could handle."
Ian listened to Jay's animated recounting of the evening's events, battling a surge of jealousy that felt both irrational and consuming. Jay's obvious pleasure in describing his expanding social connections should have been gratifying. It was evidence of healthy relationship-building. Instead, Ian catalogued each new person who now had claims on Jay's time and attention.
"It sounds like quite the adventure," Ian managed.
"It was. Though I'm hoping my next social planning challenge involves less potential for physical injury."
Ian managed what he hoped was a supportive smile, but he couldn't shake the selfish wish that Jay's best stories still came from their shared experiences.
The following week created a new pattern that Ian found deeply unsettling. Jay's scheduled apartment viewings meant he left work at five o'clock each day, abandoning their extended evening hours and kitchen conversations. Each departure left Ian alone in the office, staring at work he'd have to complete alone, drinking coffee that tasted flat.
Jay spent nearly every afternoon touring apartments, covering over twenty options across different neighbourhoods. Only Tuesday remained sacred, reserved for his gym session with Rus. Each evening he returned home with new photos, fresh notes, and growing clarity about what kind of space he wanted to call home.
The apartment hunting process turned out to be quite frustrating for Jay. He had prepared comprehensive materials consisting of printed listings with key information that he supplemented with detailed notes. His requirements were reasonable, but finding the right combination of factors within his budget was proving challenging.
The first property, a modern flat close to the office, was sleek and convenient but cramped and expensive. The second, in an older building near the historic district, offered more space and character but would add twenty minutes to his commute. The third fell somewhere between the two extremes but lacked natural light and had a kitchen that barely qualified as functional.
By Thursday evening, Jay had accumulated a folder full of detailed notes but no clear frontrunner among his options.
On Friday morning, Jay camped in the office kitchen during the coffee break, a thick folder spread across the table as he discussed his findings with Zoe and Luc. Other team members drifted over, drawn by the photos and animated conversation about Jay's housing prospects.
The folder was meticulously organized, beginning with a typed list of requirements and priorities, followed by information for each potential apartment complete with photos, floor plans, and detailed pros and cons lists. Jay's approach had whittled down the possibilities to twelve serious contenders, each meeting his basic requirements of good location, minimum forty-four square meters, and reasonable safety standards.
"You've really thought this through," Zoe observed, examining the materials.
"Maybe too thoroughly. I keep finding reasons why each option isn't quite right."
Luc picked up one of the listings. "This one near the cathedral looks nice. Historic area, good size."
"Beautiful neighbourhood, but the building is older, with potential maintenance issues. And longer commute."
"What about this modern place? Great location, all the amenities," Zoe held up another one.
"Tiny. I'd barely have more space than I do now."
Kim read the listings. "These industrial district ones look impressive. Much more space for the money, and the vibe of the area is awesome."
"They are. Great value, modern amenities, but the metro access is less convenient. It would add a fifteen minute walk to my daily commute each way."
"You're overthinking this. Pick the one that feels right when you walk in. All the analysis in the world won't tell you what it's like to actually live somewhere," Luc said.
"I suppose I could narrow it down to the top two and spend more time in each space," Jay conceded.
Amy looked over the financial calculations Jay had included with each option. "You're being too conservative with your budget. The financial district apartments would put you right in the heart of everything."
"And cost twice what I'm comfortable spending," Jay replied with a laugh.
Max, who had been quietly reviewing the materials, finally looked up. "Stop being so frugal and move somewhere that will make you happy. You can afford more than you think you can."
The conversation continued with each colleague advocating for different priorities. Jay listened to all perspectives, but it only made the decision process more overwhelming.
As the end of the day approached and colleagues began gathering their belongings for the weekend, Luc appeared at Jay's desk with a sly expression.
"Last week's adventure was definitely entertaining, but my ego is still bruised from losing to your muscle-bound friends."
Jay looked up from his computer with undisguised distrust. "And?"
"It requires compensation."
"I thought you had fun."
"I did. But being thoroughly beaten by three strangers in front of my flatmates has damaged my reputation."
"What do you have in mind for compensation?"
"A blind date. That's what you should have organized in the first place instead of a sweaty gathering of burly men."
"Absolutely not."
"I already have everything arranged. Gav is bringing someone he knows from college, and we need one more person because there will be four women. You literally just have to show up and fill out the numbers."
"Luc, I don't do blind dates. I don't do dates at all, really."
"Hear me out. What you organized last week was fun, but what I actually needed was something more... social. Romantic, even."
"Still not interested."
"You owe me for the humiliation of being defeated in sword combat by people I'd never met before. Plus you don't have to do anything, just show up and be polite. It's a numbers game, nothing more."
Jay looked at his apartment folders, then back at Luc's expectant face. The guilt trip was working, despite his complete lack of interest in romantic social activities.
"This is a terrible idea," Jay said finally.
"That's not a no."
"It's not a yes either."
"Come on, Jay. One evening. What's the worst that could happen?"
Jay could think of numerous answers to that question, none of them comforting. But Luc's persistence, combined with the guilt over the fencing evening's unintended consequences, was wearing down his resistance.
"I hate this," Jay said with resignation.
"Noted. But you're still coming."
Jay sighed heavily, already regretting his decision. "Fine. But I'm warning you now that I'm going to be terrible at this."
"You just have to show up. That's enough."
"When is this supposed to happen?" Jay asked, resigned to his fate.
"Tomorrow night. Saturday dinner, very civilized."
"Tomorrow? "You couldn't give me more warning?"
"I wanted to make sure you couldn't overthink it and talk yourself out of it."
"This is going to be a disaster," Jay muttered, but Luc was already moving on to logistical details, clearly considering the matter decided.
From his office, Ian had been listening to this conversation with growing fury. By the time Luc left, Ian was struggling to maintain composure. The thought of Jay on a date, potentially connecting with someone who might become important in his life, was almost suffocating.
He gave himself several minutes to calm down before approaching Jay's desk, trying to appear casual.
"A date, huh?"
Jay spun in his desk chair, his expression showing obvious dismay. "It's a dreadful idea. I hate everything about it and want to bail."
"Your comfort matters too. Luc should consider that before making these demands."
"I know, but I did promise to do something to cheer him up, and apparently I delivered the wrong kind of entertainment last week." Jay sighed heavily. "What's the worst that could happen, right?"
Ian wanted to enumerate exactly what could happen, starting with Jay meeting someone wonderful and ending with the complete destruction of Ian's fragile emotional landscape. Instead, he managed a supportive response.
"If it becomes unbearable, you could always leave early."
"True. Maybe I'll call you to come pick me up if it goes badly."
"Absolutely do that. I'll keep my phone by my side all evening."
Jay seemed comforted by this offer, unaware that Ian was already planning to spend Saturday evening anxiously waiting for exactly such a call.
