Chapter 35: Home
Scene 1
Help
Jay arrived at the office at seven thirty on Tuesday morning. The building was quiet, the hallways empty. He made his way to his desk and set down his bag. The office felt peaceful.
He prepared coffee and opened his workstation. Outside, the sky was overcast. The temperature had climbed a few degrees. Spring was supposedly approaching, though the city remained stubbornly cold. He still wore his winter coat. The weather had been terrible for months now. He couldn't remember the last time April felt this frigid.
Ian arrived just before eight.
"Good morning," Ian said as he passed.
"Morning."
Ian paused at the threshold of his office. "How were your holidays?"
"Good. Very good, actually. I spent the weekend at my mother's house. We had the full Easter feast. Multiple courses, eggs, hams. I probably gained five kilograms. I'll have to work out twice as hard at the gym today."
"It sounds like you enjoyed yourself."
"I did. It was nice to spend time with my family. My mother cried when I told her about the apartment."
"She must be proud of you."
"I think she is. What about you? Did you take any time off?"
"I researched potential candidates for the new positions. We have several promising picks. I have a good feeling about them. Hopefully by May the team will expand."
"That would be a relief."
"Yes. It would. You look better."
"I feel better. The break helped."
"Good. That's good."
Ian entered his office, and Jay returned to his desk. Work felt manageable again after the relentless months of strategy season. The backlog was shrinking. They were catching up. The other coworkers began arriving soon. Amy came in first, then Kim and Ela. By nine the office was alive again.
"How was your holiday?" Zoe asked as she passed Jay's desk.
"Great. I visited my family. You?"
"I stayed home and read books."
Luc appeared shortly after, looking unusually cheerful. "Jay! You're back. Did you bring any leftover cake?"
"My mother sent me home with enough food to last a week."
"You should share."
"It's in my fridge at home."
"Tragic."
Max wandered over with his coffee. "Welcome back, Jay. Good holiday?"
"Very good. Yours?"
"Excellent. I went hiking with my wife. The trails were muddy but beautiful."
Everyone exchanged stories. Ela had visited her sister. Amy had reorganized her house. The atmosphere was relaxed. The pressure of the previous months had finally lifted. Jay worked through the morning. Shortly before lunch, his phone rang. An unfamiliar number.
"Hello?"
"Good morning, Mr. Hall. This is Jasper Bank. I'm calling to inform you that your mortgage paperwork is complete. You can come in to sign at your convenience."
"Oh. That's excellent news. Tomorrow at four?"
"That works perfectly. We'll see you then."
"Thank you."
Jay ended the call and sat very still. It was real. It was actually happening. He got up and walked to Ian's door. Ian looked up from his monitor.
"Something wrong?"
"No. The opposite, actually. The bank just called. My mortgage paperwork is ready. I need to sign tomorrow. Would it be alright if I left early? Around three thirty?"
"Of course. Take whatever time you need."
"Thank you."
Jay returned to his desk. His hands were shaking slightly. He called the agent next.
"Mr. Hall! Perfect timing. I was just about to reach out to you."
"The bank called. I'm signing tomorrow at four."
"Wonderful. I'll meet you there. We'll handle everything at once. If all goes smoothly, you'll have your keys by the end of the week."
"This week?"
"Absolutely. These things move quickly when the paperwork is in order."
"I see."
"We pride ourselves on it. I'll see you tomorrow at the bank."
After they hung up, Jay set down his phone. This week. He'd expected another month of waiting. Instead, everything was accelerating. That afternoon at the gym, Jay found Rus immediately.
"Are you free this weekend? The mortgage paperwork is ready. I'm signing tomorrow. The agent says I'll have the keys this week."
"This week? That's fast."
"Very fast. I was wondering if you'd be available Saturday afternoon? For the move?"
"Saturday? Yeah, I can do that. I'll bring the van. You want me to ask the guys?"
"If they're free, that would be helpful."
"Consider it done. Don't skip Saturday morning's session, though. It's your last workout before you abandon us for your fancy new neighbourhood."
"I'm not abandoning anyone."
"Sure. That's what they all say."
"I'll be there Saturday morning. Promise."
"Good."
The next day, Jay left work at three-thirty. The taxi ride to the bank felt surreal, like he was watching someone else's life unfold. The agent was already waiting outside.
"Mr. Hall. Right on time."
"Hello."
They entered together. A woman led them to a private office. The paperwork was extensive. Jay read through it, though he trusted Ian's recommendations. Everything was as discussed before. Interest rate, down payment, payment schedule, terms and conditions. He noticed something when he reached the purchase contract.
"There's a parking spot listed."
"Yes, spot 34 in the underground garage," the agent confirmed.
"And a storage unit."
"Unit 73B. That's my fault for not mentioning it earlier. It came with the property."
Jay looked at him. The agent's expression was completely innocent.
"I see."
He signed anyway. It was too late to object now, and the rest of the contract was reasonable. The money transfer happened instantly. They left the bank and drove to the notary's office. More paperwork. More signatures. The agent produced utility contracts.
"We should handle these now as well," the agent said.
They found a coffee shop and claimed a secluded table.
"Internet providers?" the agent asked, pulling up a comparison sheet.
Jay scanned the options. "This one. The fastest available."
"It comes bundled with full cable television access."
"That's fine. I didn't even have a television before," he said absently.
"You'll enjoy it. The cable package includes quite a lot."
Jay signed the last form. The agent handed him a set of keys.
"Congratulations, Mr. Hall. I’ll forward these forms to the relevant offices. The utilities will be active within twenty-four hours. You're free to move in whenever you'd like."
Jay accepted the small key ring. Two keys, plus a fob for the building entrance.
"Thank you."
"It was my pleasure. If you need anything else, don't hesitate to call."
Jay took a taxi back to his studio. It was nearly eight when he arrived. He set the keys on the kitchen counter and looked around. Boxes everywhere. His entire life packed and ready to go.
He texted Rus. "Saturday move is confirmed. Got the keys today."
The response came quickly. "We will be ready. See you Saturday."
Jay made himself dinner from the leftovers his mother had packed. Just a few more days and he'd leave this place behind. The apartment felt strange now, like it already belonged to someone else.
Thursday morning, he arrived at work early again. When Ian came in, Jay went straight to his office.
"It's done," Jay said from the doorway.
Ian looked up. "The apartment?"
"Everything's signed. I have the keys. I'm moving in Saturday."
"This Saturday? Do you need help?"
"Rus and some friends from the gym are coming with a van. I couldn't possibly ask my boss to help me move boxes."
"I'm not just your boss. I'd like to think I'm also a friend. And soon I'll be your neighbour. But if having me there would be awkward—"
"No," Jay interrupted quickly. "It wouldn't be awkward at all. I'd love for you to be there. I just didn't want to impose."
"You're not imposing."
"Then I'd appreciate your help."
"What time?"
"Afternoon. Probably around two?"
"I'll be there."
Ian felt guilty about the manipulation, but he wanted to be there. This was important. He wouldn't miss it.
At lunch, Jay mentioned it to the others. "I'm moving on Saturday. To the new apartment."
"Finally! Do you need help?" Luc asked. 
"I have a few people coming already. But if you're free—"
"I'm free. I'll be there. I want to see this place anyway."
Zoe looked up from her salad. "I can help too. I don't have plans Saturday afternoon."
"Are you sure? It's just moving boxes."
"Someone needs to make sure Luc doesn't snoop through all your things."
"I'm going to snoop. I'm very curious about how normal people live."
"You're exhausting," Zoe said.
"I'm helpful."
"Alright. Saturday afternoon, then. Thank you," Jay said.
Kim grinned. "Bringing half the office to your new place. This is basically a housewarming party."
"It's not a party. It's just moving boxes."
Jay looked around the table at his coworkers—his friends—and smiled. He'd come to this company alone and uncertain. Now he had more help than he knew what to do with.
Scene 2
Interior design
Jay left work at five on Thursday and headed straight for the upscale department store downtown. He wanted to make his first night in the new apartment special.
The store was enormous. Jay started in the alcohol section. He needed to thank his friends properly for helping with the move. He selected a few bottles of whiskey, wincing slightly at the price but adding it to his cart anyway. Then three different wines. An assortment of crunchy snacks and fancy dips.
But those were for his guests. For himself, for the first night, he wanted something more.
New pyjamas. Soft, comfortable ones in deep blue. Fluffy slippers. A long bathrobe in cream. Brand new toiletries with rich, fresh smells. He opened several bottles, testing the scents—bergamot and cedar and something citrus.
Then towels. Thick, colourful ones. He wanted to coordinate his bathroom, make it bright and cheerful. Spring was coming. He picked lime green as his theme. Bath towels and hand towels in matching shades.
A new iron. A kettle. Pots and pans. A hairdryer. He'd never used one before, but now he had space for it. Why not?
Bath products. Sponges. Bath bombs in a glass jar. Salts in various colours and fragrances. Subtle scent sachets for his new closets. Fragrance sticks for the living room.
He really knocked himself out. He didn't look at the cost at all. His recent paycheck and raise had put him in comfortable territory again. The apartment cost was no longer extravagant. He had savings on top of it. To hell with frugality. He was moving into his own home. He would splurge.
He also bought soil and a fresh pot for his spider plant. He'd researched its preferences beforehand and consulted a store assistant with photos of the plant from different angles.
"This one needs good drainage. And indirect light. This ceramic pot would be perfect size," the assistant said, examining the photos. 
"I'll take it."
His companion deserved upgrades too.
When he took the taxi back to his studio, he was loaded with packages and struggled up the stairs, bags cutting into his hands. He really couldn't wait for a place with an elevator.
He immediately did laundry, loading two full rounds into the machines in the basement. The last rounds of laundry in this laundromat before he ascended to having a personal machine in his bathroom. He packed everything in a fresh box labeled "for the first night."
Then he re-potted his plant, transferring it to the new ceramic pot. It looked dignified now, sitting on the table. He'd need a decorative stand for it as well.
He spent the rest of the evening browsing the website of a big furniture store, selecting small decor items. Bathroom rugs. Cushions. Lighting fixtures. He added them all to his cart, planning to get them the next day.
He had trouble falling asleep that night. His head filled with images of rugs, curtains, cushions and boxes. When the alarm rang at six the next morning, he didn't feel rested at all.
He got up anyway and took a cold shower. He couldn't even drink coffee or have breakfast. Everything was already packed, and he had no food left in the fridge.
He left for work early and bought breakfast at his favourite bakery on the way, which he ate at his desk.
He couldn't focus on work. His attention drifted to clothes hangers and sock storage solutions. Every now and then he'd open the furniture store web page and compare plates and glasses.
Ian approached his desk at one of those moments. Jay had three different dish sets open in separate tabs.
Ian looked at the screen with a barely contained smile. He pointed to one set. "This one looks best."
Jay's face burned. "I'm working. Mostly."
"Of course. The blue trim is elegant."
"You think so?"
"I do."
Ian didn't move away immediately, giving suggestions on various items, and Jay was too excited to feel truly embarrassed. As soon as five came, he almost darted out of the office.
"See you tomorrow!" he called to Ian, Luc, and Zoe.
He took a taxi straight to the furniture store. It was massive, floor after floor of arranged displays. He spent hours touching rugs and measuring tables. He bought everything he'd planned. Bathroom rug to match the towels. Colour-coordinated containers for soap and body wash and shampoo. A really fluffy living room rug and a matching mat for the door. Silky bed sheets and bedding. Pillows and cushions. The decorative stand for his plant. Lightning fixtures that looked fancy. Cleaning and laundry supplies.
The checkout took twenty minutes. The total made him wince, but only slightly. He ate dinner in the store restaurant, surrounded by an entire cart full of items. He'd gotten overexcited.
Getting everything to the taxi was an ordeal. He called for one of the large vehicles and threw apologetic looks at the driver as he loaded the trunk with furniture boxes, some of them quite heavy.
"Moving day?" the driver asked.
"Tomorrow. Just getting ready."
"That's a lot of ready."
Jay laughed breathlessly. "Yes. Thank you for your patience."
"No problem. I've seen worse."
Jay thanked his foresight to start going to the gym. A year of regular workouts definitely helped with the heavy lifting.
As they drove toward his new apartment, the vision of getting everything upstairs seemed bleak. Even with an elevator, it would be difficult. He thought for a moment, then called Ian.
"Hello?"
"Hi. Are you already home?"
"I am. Is something wrong?"
"No. Nothing's wrong. I was wondering if you could come over in fifteen minutes? I'm on my way to the apartment and I have an excessive amount of packages."
He could almost hear Ian grin through the phone. "I'll be there."
When they arrived, Ian was already waiting in front of the building. He was still in his suit with a coat over it. The evening air was cold.
"I'm so sorry. I got overexcited," Jay said immediately.
He opened the trunk. Ian looked at the mountain of boxes and tried to suppress his grin.
"You certainly did."
"I can manage if—"
"Don't be absurd."
Ian began unloading the boxes, wielding the heaviest ones as if they weighed nothing. Jay gave a generous tip to the driver when they were done. They stood in front of the building entrance, looking at the tower of boxes in dismay.
"I got overexcited," Jay said pitifully.
"It's understandable."
"Is it?"
"Yes."
Ian picked up two of the largest boxes. "Let's get these inside."
It took several trips. Jay opened the door with his new key, stepping inside and looking around. The apartment looked dull in the evening lamplight. Bare and impersonal.
"Would you like tea? Or coffee?" Jay asked, then remembered. "Oh. The new kettle is still at my studio.'"
"It's quite alright."
Ian was already taking off his coat and shoes, clearly intending to help unpack.
"You really don't have to—"
"I'm already here. Just tell me where things go."
Jay wanted to protest, but frankly he needed the help. "The bathroom things go in the bathroom. Kitchen items in the kitchen. Everything else in the living room for now."
They got to work. Jay started the first load of laundry in the washing machine—the new sheets he planned to use. The machine had a massive display with countless options. He skimmed the user manual and selected what seemed appropriate, watching with fascination as it started.
"This is so much better than the basement laundromat," he murmured.
"I'd imagine so."
While it washed, he began unloading dishes with Ian and loading them into the dishwasher. He hand-washed two glasses and filled them with tap water.
"The building has filters installed. Apparently the tap water is actually good."
He tasted it. It didn't taste like pipes at all.
"It is," Ian confirmed.
They placed rugs and lights and candle holders. Cushions on the sofa. Remains of boxes went into a pile by the door. Jay moved the laundry to the dryer. They rinsed cupboards, washed dishes, dried them, placed them in their new homes. After over three hours, they looked at their handiwork. The place looked much more cosy.
Then Jay took down the generic wall decor that came with the apartment. Abstract prints in muted colours.
"This is depressing," he said.
"Agreed."
"Let me put these in the storage. Want to see it?"
They went down to the basement level. The storage unit was quite large, placed right next to the designated parking spot. He placed the unwanted art inside and looked around.
"This is huge. I won't have to worry about space for years."
He turned to Ian. He had zero doubts this arrangement was also Ian's doing. The parking spot, the storage, the impossibly good mortgage rate. All of it. He didn't comment. He just sighed deeply and smiled the most radiant smile Ian had ever seen. Jay looked so happy. It was worth everything.
"Thank you. For everything."
"You're welcome."
"We should head back up. The laundry should be done by now," Jay said finally.
"Yes. Of course."
They took the elevator back to the fourth floor. The apartment felt warmer now. Jay pulled the bedding from the dryer. It was still slightly damp but warm and soft.
"I'll iron the sheets properly tomorrow and make the bed," Jay said, checking his watch. "It's already past eleven."
"I should go."
"I couldn't have done this without you."
"I'm glad I could help."
Ian collected his coat and shoes. Jay walked him to the door.
"See you tomorrow?" Ian asked.
"Tomorrow. I'm looking forward to it."
After Ian left, Jay took one last look around. The apartment glowed in the lamplight. He set out the fragrance sticks, placing just three in the container so the scent wouldn't overwhelm, then locked the door behind him.
One more night in the old place. Tomorrow he'd move his boxes and leave for good. Tomorrow, he'd begin a new chapter of his life.
He returned and fell asleep almost immediately, exhausted and content, dreaming of lime-green towels and filtered water and Ian's smile in the warm light of his new home.
Scene 3
The move
Jay woke up at seven on Saturday morning. He set out his clothes for the day, then packed the rest of his things. The sheets from the bed. The last glass. Everything else was already boxed and ready.
He ate breakfast at a nearby café, then stopped at a local bakery on his way back. He bought a proper cake and a selection of pastries for the evening. Then he headed to the gym for one last session in his old neighbourhood.
He was both excited and frigid with anxiety. Just a few more hours.
Rus patted his back reassuringly. "You look like you're about to throw up."
"I might."
"Things will be alright. It's just moving."
"I know."
They arranged to meet at one at Jay's old apartment. Then Jay went back for his last shower there. He wore clean clothes—his new jeans, sneakers, and a fresh gym shirt. He packed everything else, including his still-damp towel in a plastic bag.
He did one last survey of every nook and cranny. The fridge was already cleaned and unplugged. The old appliances donated. He was ready.
Rus arrived punctually at one with Mic and Van in a worn white minivan he'd borrowed from his brother-in-law.
"Ready?" Rus asked.
"Ready."
They got to work right away, moving the boxes down the stairs one by one. They were done in twenty minutes.
"Good thing you don't have many possessions," Mic said, loading the last box.
"Makes the job easier," Van agreed.
As they secured the boxes in the vehicle, Jay did one last inspection of the apartment. He took several photos. The place looked clean, modest, barren. It was a depressing sight.
He picked up his spider plant and joined his friends in the minivan. They departed for his new home.
"There will be additional people waiting for us. My coworkers volunteered to help," Jay said as they drove.
"The more the merrier," Rus said.
Jay sent messages that they were on their way. He sat in the passenger seat while Mic and Van talked in the back. He looked out the window at the passing city. It was late April already. The weather had mercifully gotten a bit warmer.
When they arrived, people were already waiting in front of the building. Zoe and Luc each held a large bag. Ian stood next to several big packages, one of them thin, tall, and wide. He wore jeans, sneakers, and a sweater. It was the first time Jay had seen him wear something that looked like actual casual wear. His hair was slightly ruffled, as if he'd run his hand through it to complete the look. Or perhaps it got tousled when he wrestled with whatever he'd brought.
Next to him stood Leo, equally loaded with big bags.
Jay's face fell.
They climbed out of the van. Ian stepped forward with a proposal.
"We can park in the underground spot. It's close to the elevator. Much easier."
But before they could move, Jay addressed Leo directly. "I don't recall inviting you."
Leo made an innocent face. "I invited myself."
Rus sensed the tension. "Something wrong?"
Jay made a face. "This is Leo. The man who hired me. The son of the owner of the company."
"Oh. Is this the guy who hired you because you're pretty?" Rus looked Leo up and down.
Jay's face went red. "Yes."
Rus burst out laughing. Everyone else joined in, tension breaking like a snapped wire.
Leo looked scandalized. "It seems Jay has been telling stories about me."
"Accurate stories," Jay said.
"I want to make amends to my favourite employee." Leo placed a hand over his chest dramatically. "And for the record, I didn't hire you for your looks. I hired you for your mettle. The HR department already did the preliminary selection. They only sent me presentable candidates. Your looks were just a bonus."
"Questionable judgement on all counts," Jay muttered.
"I'm properly apologetic. I brought housewarming gifts. This seemed like the best moment to fix our relationship. You won't be so heartless as to chase me off, will you?"
Jay sighed. "Suit yourself."
They parked in the underground spot. Jay made proper introductions. Luc already knew Rus and his friends from the fencing debacle, but the others were new.
"I thought Ian was the boss," Rus said, looking confused.
"I am," Ian confirmed. "The hierarchy is rather relaxed."
Rus eyed Ian suspiciously but said nothing.
They began taking boxes up. With so many people and the elevator, the entire process took record time. Everyone made themselves comfortable inside while Jay directed which boxes went where.
People volunteered to help unpack. Jay eventually gave in and started assigning tasks.
Ian and Leo went to the bedroom to unpack clothes. Zoe and Luc dealt with the dishes. Rus, Mic, and Van stayed in the living room unpacking books and various trinkets.
Jay moved around everyone, instructing and coordinating. He placed his spider plant in a prominent spot on the bookshelf. He shooed Luc away from trying to rummage through his underwear drawer.
"I was just trying to help organize," Luc protested.
"Organize somewhere else."
Jay watched for a moment as Ian expertly hung his suits in the massive closet, organized by colour and formality level. Then he sorted the ties with equal expertise.
Rus was folding the empty boxes into a neat pile near the door. Very soon everything was unpacked, and things without a final destination got shoved into the entrance closet for Jay's further decision.
Jay boiled water in the new kettle for refreshments. As the work was drawing to a close, Leo made an offer.
"I'll order takeout from a local place I know and like. My treat."
Jay accepted reluctantly. He'd wanted to do that himself.
The food arrived as they were finishing up, barely past four. The entire production took less than three hours. Jay was impressed by what a big and motivated party could accomplish in such a short time.
They took places around the apartment. The dining table could fit four people comfortably. Rus, Mic, Van, and Luc sat there. Ian and Leo sat on the sofa. Zoe took the armchair. Jay sat on a cushion in front of the coffee table.
Jay insisted they unload the takeout onto proper plates.
"I bought new plates and I want to test drive them."
"Fair enough," Luc said.
Jay had bought everything in sets of eight, thinking of the size of their team at work. It perfectly matched the number of people present.
The food was Mediterranean but very diverse. Leo had ordered enough for twice as many people.
"At least you'll have leftovers to last you a couple of days while you're getting used to the place," Leo said.
Jay opened the alcohol bottles. Everyone poured themselves their preferred drinks. Zoe made a cocktail. Luc and Leo hoarded wine. Rus's team and Ian preferred straight whiskey. Jay poured himself a glass of wine.
Someone took photos. Laughter and chatter filled the apartment. It was small, and such a crowd barely fit, but somehow it didn't feel cramped. It felt convivial. Then the gifts were handed out.
Rus and his friends produced a bag with fitness equipment. A yoga mat, dumbbells, stretching bands.
"Don't neglect your form now that you won't have me regularly watching after you," Rus said.
"I won't. Promise."
Zoe brought several big boxes of different candles. "There's always a time for mood lighting." She also produced a big cake.
Luc handed over a large, modern, abstractly shaped crystal vase and a bouquet of fresh flowers that he'd somehow managed to keep hidden but that hadn't withered at all.
"It's too big for the place," Jay said, setting it on the coffee table.
"It adds character," Luc insisted.
"It does," Zoe agreed.
Leo took out the newest generation console in a limited edition version with a whole box of accessories. Jay looked at it suspiciously.
"I heard you have younger siblings who will definitely visit. At least you should keep them entertained."
From the second bag he produced an entire selection of clearly expensive alcohol and soft drinks. Then he reached for the largest bag resting in the corner. Out came a proper sound system, complete with surprisingly large speakers. "The least we could do was make it a proper party."
Rus and his friends cheered. Jay looked miserable. "I don't want a police visit on my first night here."
He got ignored. The party started in earnest.
Ian tried to comfort him. "The soundproofing in these buildings is great. It's a good opportunity to test it."
Ian then handed over his gift. The big box turned out to be a painting. It was from the same artist Jay had enjoyed at the art show last year, a piece vaguely similar to the one Ian had in his living room.
Jay was touched. "This is beautiful."
They hung it where the generic art had been before in the central living room. It livened up the place.
Ian also handed him a huge bag of various groceries. "For a good start."
And another bag of bed sheets and towels in coordinated colours. "For when you'd like to change the colour scheme."
He also produced another large cake.
"That's three cakes," Zoe observed.
"We'll manage," Luc said confidently.
Jay set everything down. He looked at Ian, then at everyone else in the apartment. At the gifts. At the laughter. At the home they'd helped him create. He was so touched by everyone's generosity that he didn't even complain about them getting rowdy. Even Leo seemed less offensive somehow.
"Thank you. All of you. Really."
"You're welcome," Zoe said.
"It's what friends do," Luc added.
Leo raised his glass. "To Jay's new home."
"To Jay's new home!" everyone echoed.
Jay raised his own glass and drank. The wine was good. The food was good. The company was good. Everything was good.
Scene 4
Housewarming party
The party continued. Luc and Rus plugged in the audio system. Jay pulled out his laptop to play some music.
Luc's eyes widened. "That's a top-of-the-line model."
Jay looked sheepish. "It's courtesy of our foreign clients we signed last year."
"Kim would die from jealousy if he saw it."
"Best not to show it to him then."
Music filled the apartment—something upbeat that made people start moving unconsciously.
In the meantime, Mic was attempting to charm Zoe. She listened politely for approximately thirty seconds before shutting him down completely.
"I appreciate the interest, but no thank you."
Mic retreated to the balcony railing to sulk over his whiskey. Leo joined him, clapping him on the shoulder. "Chin up. Plenty of other opportunities."
"She didn't even hesitate."
Inside, Jay found Zoe by the drinks table. "I'm so sorry about Mic. He's absolutely a menace. Don't feel guilty about telling him off."
Zoe smiled. "I don't. I've handled worse."
Van had migrated to the couch next to Ian, examining him with open curiosity. "You're pretty well-built for a banker."
"I work out regularly."
"Yeah? What's your routine?"
Ian described his training schedule. Van's face lit up with immediate interest. They began comparing their fitness achievements and diet plans. Van got more and more animated by the minute. Hydration, protein, creatine. Jay caught only the general idea and shook his head in theatrical resignation. Rus joined their conversation as well. Soon the couch and its orbit turned into a fitness discussion club.
Zoe turned to Jay. "Want to make a quick run to the store? We need ice for drinks. And I want coconut milk for cocktails."
"Let's go then."
They left for the nearby grocery store. When they returned twenty minutes later, they saw Van without his shirt, flexing his muscles while Luc and Leo cheered enthusiastically.
Jay facepalmed. "What's going on?"
Rus explained happily. "Van is doing a demonstration of the superiority of his particular workout philosophy."
Jay moved to the kitchen area with Zoe and their shopping. Zoe made fancy drinks for everyone interested, which was only herself, Jay, and Luc. Rus joined them but only to add ice to his whiskey glass. Ian came as well.
They began chatting more seriously. The alcohol seemed to make Rus more blunt.
"You're Jay's boss, right?"
"I am."
"You've been making Jay stressed. Working unreasonable hours. That's poor management."
Jay tried to intervene. "Rus—"
"I'm not wrong."
Leo looked highly amused.
Ian's expression was calm. "You're right. It was my failure. We're expanding the team to ensure the workload is more equally divided. We should have done this much earlier."
Rus approved. "Good that you at least see your faults."
"Rus, please—" Jay tried again.
They both completely disregarded him.
"You're different than I imagined. I can see why Jay is so fiercely loyal. A man with such gym discipline must have his priorities in order."
Ian looked briefly startled, then recovered. "Thank you."
Meanwhile, Luc started arm wrestling with Van on the small coffee table. He lost spectacularly.
"I told Jay he needed more space for entertaining. If the living room had enough room I'd definitely win," Luc grumbled.
Everyone laughed.
The scene continued to be rowdy with music and cheering. Jay went outside to do a loudness check. The soundproofing was impressive. Maybe they really wouldn't have the cops called on them.
Eventually Leo excused himself. "I should head out. Thank you for tolerating me."
"Thank you for coming. And for the gifts," Jay said diplomatically.
"You're welcome. Enjoy the console."
Zoe left shortly after. "This was fun. Your place is lovely, Jay."
"Thanks for the candles."
The rest stayed and partied for two more hours. Once ten came and they made no move to leave, Ian noticed Jay getting sleepy. He ushered the company away.
"Time to go," Ian said firmly.
"Already?" Rus protested.
"It's getting late."
"We can come to my place. I've got more whiskey." Luc said.
Jay handed them a box with leftover cake and two bottles of whiskey from Leo's stash.
"Thanks for everything," Jay said.
"We'll return for the car some other time," Rus said.
Then they were gone, and Jay was alone with Ian in a completely wrecked apartment. But Jay was in such a good mood he didn't mind. He looked around at the chaos and smiled.
Ian began collecting dishes. Jay moved to protest, but Ian was already loading the dishwasher.
"You don't have to," Jay protested.
"I want to."
"You've already done so much."
"It's just cleaning."
They worked together. Leftovers into the fridge, dishes into the dishwasher, trash into bags. Ian accompanied Jay to the trash building, a separate structure near the street, locked and surprisingly orderly.
"This is so much better than my old place," Jay said, impressed.
"It's a well-maintained building."
They returned to wipe the surfaces, wash and store plates, and load another dishwasher full of glasses. Jay was amazed at the utility.
"A washing machine. A dishwasher. It's like living in the future."
"You should get a robot vacuum."
Jay laughed. "That's ridiculous."
Ian collected his coat and moved toward the door. "I should go."
"Stay a bit longer?" Jay asked.
"It's late. You're tired."
"I know. But I don't feel like ending the evening quite yet. My first night in my new home. It feels weirdly scary. What if I wake up and it turns out to be a dream?"
"It's not a dream."
"But what if it is?"
Ian turned back. "I can stay if it will make you more comfortable."
"The couch is definitely much more comfortable than my last one. And I definitely liked it much more when you were there when I woke up hungover than the alternative of having to get my water myself."
"You're drunk."
"Only a little."
"I'll stay then."
Jay suddenly remembered something. "I wanted to iron the sheets before sleeping."
"I'll do it. You should shower."
"Bath. I want to try the bath."
"Then take a bath."
Jay disappeared into the bathroom. Soon after, steam began seeping under the door, filling the air with the scent of at least seven bath products. The whole place started smelling like an expensive perfumery.
Ian found the iron and ironing board in the entrance closet, set them up in the bedroom, and got to work on the sheets. Then he made the bed properly.
The bathroom door opened eventually. Jay emerged in soft new pyjamas, wearing his bathrobe, a lime-green towel wrapped around his hair, fluffy slippers on his feet. He looked absolutely blissful.
"That was amazing. The bath is huge. I could practically swim in it."
"I'm glad you enjoyed it."
Jay moved to the kitchen and began heating milk in a small pot, adding honey and spices. He poured two mugs and brought them to the couch. They sat together, drinking warm milk like children. The apartment was quiet now, music off. Jay's eyes were drooping. He finished his milk, brushed his teeth, and stumbled toward the bedroom.
"Thank you," he called out. "For everything."
"You're welcome. Sleep well."
Ian tidied up the rest of the place. He checked that everything was secure. The door was locked. The windows were closed. The kitchen was clean.
Then he dropped onto the couch. It really was bigger and more comfortable than Jay's old one. It could even be opened to make a proper bed, though Ian didn't bother. He lay down as he was, fully dressed, and stared at the ceiling.
It had been a great day. Jay was happy. Safe. Surrounded by people who cared about him. Living in a beautiful space that he could truly call home.
Ian closed his eyes and let himself feel the joy of having helped make this happen. Of being here for Jay's first night. Of being trusted enough to stay.
Scene 5
First morning
Jay woke up the next morning and groaned immediately. His head felt like someone had stuffed it with cotton and then set it on fire. The light coming through the window was too bright, the world too loud, everything too much. A voice cut through the fog.
"Here. Take this."
He lifted his head with difficulty. Ian stood beside the bed, holding out a glass of water and a painkiller.
Jay accepted both, swallowing the pill with a croaking "Thank you."
"You're welcome."
Jay collapsed back against the pillow. "I can't believe I made you babysit my hangover again."
Ian laughed. "I'm starting to have some experience in this matter. I'll make coffee."
He left the bedroom. Jay lay there for another minute, gathering the strength to move. Eventually he managed to sit up, then stand. He shuffled out of the bedroom on unsteady feet. He made his way to the armchair and collapsed into it, pulling his legs up under himself and burying his head in his arms. The nausea was tolerable if he stayed very still. The headache was another matter.
"It will pass," Ian said softly.
Jay groaned.
Ian placed a coffee in front of him and sat on the couch on the opposite side. "How was your first night in your own home?"
Jay lifted his head and smiled wistfully. "It still doesn't feel real."
Ian thought he looked adorable in his pajamas. So pitiful and fragile and vulnerable. His defenses were down completely.
Eventually, Jay stood up when his headache began to subside slightly. "I'm going to take a shower."
"Take your time."
Jay disappeared into the bathroom and turned the water as cold as he could stand. He stayed under it for a long time, letting it wash away the worst of the hangover. When he emerged, he was wrapped in his bathrobe with his hair dripping.
"Better?" Ian asked.
"Much better. I'm glad I didn't drink too much. This is bearable."
They heated up leftovers from the party for breakfast. Jay ate slowly, testing his stomach's tolerance. It held up well enough.
"Do you want to sit on the balcony?" Jay asked when they finished eating.
Ian looked toward the windows. "It's quite cold out."
"I know. But I want to try it anyway. We can make tea. Something warming."
"Alright."
Jay got dressed and prepared root spices tea while Ian cleared the dishes. They huddled themselves in colourful soft blankets and sat on the patio couch outside, watching the river and the gray skies. The weather was miserable by any objective measure. Cold, overcast, threatening rain. But Jay thought it looked beautiful. His headache and nausea receded. He'd never felt happier.
He stole glances at Ian's face as he sat wrapped in the deep burgundy blanket and watched the weather. Jay was glad he got to share this moment with him. His first morning in his new home. He would treasure this for the rest of his life. They sat until their fingers grew stiff and their noses turned red from the cold. Finally Ian got up.
"We should go inside before we freeze."
"Probably wise."
They abandoned the balcony and returned inside, both smiling at their red faces.
"That was ridiculous," Ian said, rubbing his hands together.
"Completely worth it."
Inside, warmth slowly returned to their extremities. Jay made more tea. Then something occurred to him.
In the apartment, two spare sets of keys had been waiting for him, along with a folder of useful administrative information. He picked up one set and held it out to Ian. "Would you hold onto this? In case of emergency? I don't really have anyone else in the city."
Ian took the key, trying to act normal despite his heart contracting painfully in his chest.
"Of course. You can list me as an emergency contact too. I'm your boss after all."
Such complete faith. Ian would make sure to prove himself worthy of it.
"Thank you."
"You're welcome."
Eventually Ian said his farewells and left. Jay spent the rest of Sunday reshuffling things in his cupboards and checking interior decor and appliances online.
All of his belongings were already here, yet not even half of the storage was filled. His clothes were neatly arranged in the bedroom closet with plenty of space to spare. He could finally buy casual clothes. He had enough counter space to buy a coffee maker. All of it was unreal.
Rus came by in the evening to collect his car.
"We all crashed at Luc's place," Rus explained. "Just sobered up enough to drive now."
"I'm glad you had fun."
"It was a great party. Your place is amazing."
"Thank you for helping with the move."
"Anytime. Keep in touch, alright?"
"I will."
The burgundy blanket that Ian had used on the balcony smelled like him. Jay noticed in the evening when he was folding it. It was a divine, comforting smell. Jay took the blanket to bed with him, hugging it close. He fell asleep like that, wrapped in Ian's scent, feeling safe. He slept well that night.
The next day was Jay's first workday commuting from the new place. He got up at six as always, feeling unusually well rested. He drank coffee from the new kettle, leisurely ate leftovers, and prepared for work.
His commute was now ten minutes shorter overall. The metro ride was only ten minutes, but the walk to the metro was a bit longer. He left his home at seven as he always did and arrived at work at seven twenty-five. He still didn't have an optimal schedule and felt awkward with the new route, but he was also excited.
At work he talked about nothing else but his new apartment.
"The balcony has a view of the river," he told Ela.
"That's lovely."
"The dishwasher is incredible," he told Luc.
"Welcome to modern living."
"I have an entire closet just for clothes," he told Amy.
"That's practical."
At five, Jay went to Ian's office. Ian was reviewing documents, but looked up when Jay entered.
"Do you need something?"
"Not really. I just wanted to talk about coffee makers."
"Coffee makers?"
"I'm trying to decide between models. Do you have time?"
"I have time."
They spent two hours discussing coffee makers, storage solutions, and kitchen organization. Jay felt a bit embarrassed to take so much of Ian's time with such trivial matters, but the excitement overrode the guilt.
In the following days, the initial excitement waned to manageable levels. On Tuesday he left at five with a gym bag in hand. He took the metro back to his old neighbourhood.
Rus looked surprised when he walked into the gym. "You came back."
"I still have a paid membership. It would be a waste not to use it. I'll keep returning until the end of the month at least."
"Fair enough."
They chatted while working out. Rus brought up Jay's coworkers.
"I understand now why you're so fond of your job despite its unreasonableness. Your coworkers seem to be great people."
"They truly are. The whole team is amazing."
"And your boss isn't as scary as I expected."
"Ian's not scary at all."
"He's very dedicated to fitness. I respect that."
"He's dedicated to everything he does."
For the rest of the week, Ian was away in the afternoons holding interviews with candidates for senior analysts. Jay left at five since there was nothing urgent to do. Staying in an empty office to tackle less urgent tasks held no appeal.
Instead, he explored his new neighbourhood. He walked through parks. He cooked dinner in his new kitchen, experimenting with recipes he'd never had space to try before. He sat on the balcony with warm milk and honey and spices, watching the river and the sky.
This was so much better than his old place. Better than anything he'd imagined having. He kept expecting to wake up and find it was all a dream. But each morning he woke up in his new bed, in his new apartment, and it was still real.
