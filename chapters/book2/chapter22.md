Chapter 22: Schemer and imp
Scene 1
Travel anxiety
On Monday morning Jay sat at his desk, staring at his phone screen for the third time in ten minutes. The email from Adventure Diving Tours sat in his inbox like an unexploded device, full of passport requirements, flight information, and medical forms that needed completion.
What had seemed like such a brilliant idea last week now felt monumentally stupid. He had booked the October diving trip in a moment of euphoria, riding high on successfully convincing Ian to take actual time off—a victory that had felt impossible just months ago. The confidence he felt during that conversation had evaporated completely.
"Morning, Jay." Amy's greeting pulled him from his spiraling thoughts.
"Good morning." He managed what he hoped was a normal smile and buried himself in spreadsheets. Max and Luc had started their holidays, leaving the rest of the team to shoulder their workload. The extra hours were a welcome distraction, even if they meant staying past eight most nights.
The morning crawled by. During the daily briefing with Ian he struggled to concentrate. Every time he tried to focus on client reports, his mind wandered back to the same terrifying thoughts. He had never been on a plane. He had never left the country. He had barely traveled beyond the city limits since he moved here. What had possessed him to think he could handle flying solo to a foreign country and jumping off a boat into deep water?
Ian emerged from his office around eleven, scanning the department. His eyes lingered on Jay's desk for a moment longer than usual before he moved toward the conference room.
Jay's phone buzzed with another email from the dive company asking about dietary restrictions and emergency contacts. The panic crept higher in his chest.
Tuesday brought no relief, but there wasn't time to worry about October when August was trying to kill them all with overtime. Jay threw himself into the extra responsibilities, tackling reports that normally would have been distributed among the team.
At six o'clock sharp, he packed up and headed to the gym, holding on to the habit that had become his anchor. The weight of the barbells usually cleared his head, but today even Rus noticed something was off.
"You're pushing too hard today," his trainer said, watching Jay attempt another set despite his obvious fatigue. "What's going on?"
"Just work stuff," Jay lied, racking the weights with hands that trembled slightly. "The usual deadlines."
"Whatever's eating at you, the weights aren't going to solve it. Maybe try talking to someone who actually has ears instead of iron plates."
Jay managed a weak smile but said nothing. How could he explain that the person he most wanted to talk to was the one person he couldn't burden with his pathetic fears?
On Wednesday evening Jay and Ian were alone in the office again, the fluorescent lights casting a harsh glow over empty desks. The building had fallen into its nighttime quiet, broken only by the occasional ping of the elevator.
Jay stared at his computer screen, but the numbers weren't making sense anymore. The diving company had sent yet another email, this one with a packing list that included things he'd never heard of. He put his hands over his face and let out a long sigh.
"Jay? Is something wrong?" 
Jay startled, dropping his hands and looking up to find Ian standing beside his desk. Jay hadn't heard him approach. Ian's suit jacket was gone, his tie loosened slightly, sleeves rolled up to his forearms. It was as casual as Jay had ever seen him during work hours.
Jay laughed bitterly. "No, nothing's wrong. I might have just bitten off more than I can chew with this October trip."
Ian's eyebrows drew together slightly. "The diving course? You seemed excited."
"I was excited. I am excited. It's just..." Jay gestured helplessly at his phone. "I booked this trip thinking I was being so brave and adventurous, but Ian, I've never even been on a plane. I've never left the country. I don't know what I was thinking. They're asking for all these forms and requirements, and I keep staring at them thinking I'm going to mess something up or panic halfway through the flight or—"
"Jay. You're catastrophizing."
"Am I? Because it feels pretty realistic from where I'm sitting."
Ian moved closer, sitting on the chair across from Jay's desk. "You're learning to dive. You'll pass the basic  certifications. Just like you've handled every challenge this job has thrown at you."
"That's different. That's work. This is..." Jay trailed off, struggling to articulate the depth of his anxiety.
"This is you expanding your world. Which is exactly what you should be doing."
The confidence in Ian's words made Jay feel calmer. He had grown to trust Ian's judgment implicitly over the past year.
"I suppose I'll figure it out," Jay said finally.
Ian was quiet for a long moment, watching Jay with an expression that was difficult to read. "Yes, you will," he said eventually. 
"You've probably been flying since you were five."
"Seven. My first flight was for a mountain skiing holiday. I was terrified the plane would fall out of the sky."
"Really?"
"I refused to look out the window for the entire flight. My mother had to bribe me with chocolate just to stop me crying during take-off."
The image of a young Ian crying on a plane was so incongruous with the composed man standing before him that Jay almost smiled despite his anxiety. "Did it get better?"
"Yes, with practice. And realizing that being afraid of something doesn't mean you can't do it anyway."
Jay nodded, though his stomach was still churning. "I keep telling myself that. It's just hard when everyone expects you to know what you're doing."
"No one expects that, Jay. And anyone who does isn't worth worrying about."
There was something in Ian's voice that made Jay look up at him. Ian was watching him with an expression Jay couldn't quite read, looking softer than usual.
"Thank you," Jay said.
Thursday and Friday flew by, consumed by overtime and catch-up work. Jay managed to fill out most of the diving forms, though the flight details still made his stomach clench with anxiety. He had almost succeeded in pushing the entire issue to the back of his mind when Ian called him into his office Friday afternoon.
"Close the door, please," Ian said.
Jay complied, sitting on the chair across from Ian's desk. 
"I've arranged a business trip to the New Continent for the end of September. Garnet Ridge Group has expressed interest in our services, and their CEO is an old university acquaintance. The timing works well—it's before the chaos of quarter-end in October, and the matter has been on my list long enough."
"That sounds like something Leo would typically handle."
"Under normal circumstances, yes. But given my personal connection to their leadership, direct involvement seems more appropriate. More importantly, I believe this presents an excellent training opportunity for you."
"Training opportunity?"
"Business travel will likely become a requirement at some point in your role. Instead of waiting for an urgent situation to arise, it seems prudent to provide you with that experience during a lower-stakes engagement. Administration will handle all logistics. Your responsibilities would mirror those you've successfully managed in previous client meetings."
Jay felt his pulse quicken, but not with panic. Instead, relief began to unfold in his stomach. "You want me to come with you?"
"I believe the experience would be valuable for your development. The meeting itself is straightforward, and having you handle the standard preparation and documentation would be beneficial for both parties."
"Should I prepare anything specific?"
"I'll brief you on Garnet Ridge Group next week. For now, just ensure your passport is current."
"It is." Jay hesitated, then added, "This timing is incredibly helpful, actually. Having some international travel experience before my diving trip will probably make everything less terrifying."
"It is rather convenient, yes."
Walking back to his desk, Jay felt lighter than he had all week. The October trip still loomed, but now it felt manageable. He had weeks to prepare, and he'd have Ian there to guide him through his first international experience.
Behind his closed office door, Ian stared at his computer screen without seeing it. The relief in Jay's eyes had been worth every string he'd pulled to arrange this trip on short notice. The fact that he was being completely transparent about his motivations—and that Jay seemed oblivious to the deeper implications—only reinforced what Ian already knew about Jay's honest nature.
He was walking a dangerous path, using his position to ease Jay's personal anxiety. But watching Jay struggle alone with something Ian could easily help him through had been unbearable. This was the closest he could come to the support he truly wanted to offer without crossing lines that couldn't be uncrossed.
That he would get to spend several days in Jay's company, watching over him and ensuring his comfort, felt like a reward he had claimed for himself, one he knew he had little right to.
But Jay's smile would sustain him through whatever pretences he'd have to maintain. Sometimes, love meant finding ways to care from the shadows, and Ian was becoming an expert at loving Jay Hall in precisely that way.
Scene 2
Wishful thinking
Ian sat in his home office, scrolling through hotel listings on his laptop while the Garnet Ridge files lay scattered across the coffee table. He clicked through photos, searching for somewhere comfortable but not intimate—welcoming and cosy, without the risk of seeming romantic. Other tabs were open with flight schedules and a city map. He took notes on arrival procedures, ground transportation, every detail that might ease the anxiety he’d seen in Jay. Nothing could be left to chance.
The doorbell rang, interrupting his research. Ian frowned at his watch—nearly nine on a Saturday evening. He wasn't expecting anyone. The doorbell rang again, followed by an impatient knock.
"Ian, I know you're home. Your car's in the garage."
Leo's voice could be heard through the door. Ian sighed and set down his papers.
"Good evening, Leo." Ian opened the door to find his friend holding a bottle of expensive scotch and wearing that particular grin that meant trouble. "To what do I owe this unexpected visit?"
"Can't a man drop by to see his dearest friend?" Leo pushed past Ian into the apartment, already making himself at home. "I heard that Garnet Ridge Group suddenly became urgent enough to warrant your personal attention. Strange, considering that it's been sitting in your maybe-someday file for months."
Ian closed the door and followed Leo to the living room, where his friend was already examining the spread of documents.
"Business priorities change. You know this."
"Mm-hmm." Leo set the scotch on the side table and sat down in Ian's armchair like he owned it. "And the fact that you're personally handling what should be my territory has nothing to do with wanting some quality alone time with your assistant?"
"I don't know what you're implying."
"Oh, I think you do. Ian Hagen, the man who delegates travel to subordinates as a matter of principle, suddenly decides that an unimportant client meeting requires his personal touch. Along with his assistant, naturally."
"Think whatever you want to think."
Leo's delighted laughter filled the apartment. "There it is! The classic Ian deflection. You might as well have tattooed 'I'm planning a romantic getaway' across your forehead."
"Are you going to open that bottle, or did you bring it as decoration?"
"Changing the subject already?" But Leo obliged, producing glasses from Ian's kitchen. "I'm just saying, if you're planning to wine and dine young Mr. Hall in exotic locations, you might want to book somewhere with a decent spa. Maybe one of those places with couples' treatments."
"It's a business trip."
"Of course it is." Leo poured generous measures of scotch and handed one to Ian. "I'm sure the romantic sunset dinners and moonlit walks on the beach are just coincidental."
Ian accepted the glass and took a measured sip, Leo's commentary washing over him like background noise. His friend had always been incorrigible, and years of experience had taught Ian that engagement only encouraged him.
"You know what I love about this? You're actually living again instead of hiding behind that fortress of yours. It's been what, five years since you showed interest in anything beyond quarterly reports and gym schedules?"
"I'm ensuring a team member receives appropriate guidance."
"Right. Ian, I've been watching you two for months. The way you smooth every possible bump in his path. It's not mentorship, it's devotion."
Ian's jaw tightened, but he kept his voice level. "Jay is a valuable employee who deserves support."
"Jay is a valuable employee you're completely gone over. You know, you should probably be gentle with the poor puppy. Jay's so desperately in love with you that if you're too distant during your little trip, you might break his heart."
"Don't be ridiculous."
"Ridiculous? Ian, everyone can see it. The boy's been head over heels since day one. Honestly, it's sweet that the romance is finally progressing."
"Jay's feelings toward me is gratitude for a stable work environment. Given his previous trauma, he's hardly likely to develop romantic feelings for a boss."
"Previous trauma that you've spent over a year healing with your patient, soothing care? Oh, my naive friend. You really don't see it, do you? The way he watches you when he thinks no one's looking? The way he hangs on your every word? The absolute devastation when he thought you didn't trust him?"
"That was about respect—"
"Respect my ass. He doesn't look at anyone else the way he looks at you. Hell, he barely looks at anyone else at all. Ian, the way that man looks at you isn't gratitude. It's adoration. He lights up like the sun when you give him the smallest bit of approval—"
"He's conscientious and eager to please. That's what makes him an excellent assistant."
"And the way he worries about you? Makes sure you eat lunch? Stays late just to keep you company? You're brilliant at reading markets and people, but you're completely blind when it comes to Jay Hall."
"You're seeing what you want to see."
"Am I? Then explain why he turns pink every time you compliment his work. Why he stays late whenever you do, even when there's no reason for it."
"He's dedicated to his job."
"He's dedicated to you." Leo drained his glass and reached for the bottle. "Mark my words, this trip is going to be very educational for both of you. Might want to pack some extra supplies. A liter of good lube should—"
"Get out."
Leo burst into laughter at Ian's sharp tone. "Struck a nerve, did I? When was the last time you even let yourself think about him that way?"
Ian stood and moved to the window, his back to his friend. "Leave. Now. I think you've had enough entertainment for one evening."
"All right, all right. I'll behave." But Leo's voice still held traces of amusement. "Just promise me you'll be kind to him, Ian. Whatever happens on this trip."
Ian remained silent, watching the city lights blur and sharpen as he tried to ignore the heat that had started burning low in his belly at Leo's words. The image his friend had painted was both impossible and unbearably tempting.
"There's nothing to be kind about. It's a business trip."
"If you say so." Leo finished his second drink and stood. "But Ian, seriously—I'm happy for you. You found someone worth caring about again. Don't let fear rob you of something real just because you're terrified of making the same mistakes."
"The situation is nothing like before."
"No, it's not. Jay isn't playing games or angling for advantage. That boy would walk through fire for you." Leo paused at the door. "Maybe it's time you stopped punishing yourself for someone else's sins."
Ian waited until he heard the front door close before allowing himself to slump against the window. Leo's words echoed in his mind, painting pictures that Ian had spent months trying to suppress. The idea that Jay might feel something beyond respect was both thrilling and terrifying.
But no. Leo was wrong. He had to be wrong. Jay was innocent, earnest, and nothing more. Anything else was projection, wishful thinking, dangerous fantasy.
Ian returned to his papers, but the numbers swam before his eyes. Leo's crude suggestion hung in the air like smoke, heating his blood. The scotch burned as he finished his glass, but it did nothing to cool the fire Leo's words had ignited.
Ian poured himself another glass and tried to return to his research, but he couldn't concentrate. His mind kept spiraling into territories he'd forbidden himself to explore.
He imagined Jay in a hotel room, nervous about his first international trip, turning to Ian for reassurance. The thought of comforting him, of Jay's warmth and trust, led to darker imaginings—Jay's gray eyes looking up at him with something deeper than gratitude, hands reaching for him, that soft voice whispering his name.
Ian finished his drink and tried to prepare for bed, but his body betrayed him with its urgent response to thoughts he'd suppressed for months. In the darkness of his bedroom, he finally allowed himself to imagine Jay's pale skin beneath his hands.
The release, when it came, was intense—months of control shattered by one evening of Leo's meddling. Ian lay in the aftermath, breathing hard and staring at the ceiling, knowing he'd crossed a line in his mind that he could never uncross.
Scene 3
Meddling
Jay was gathering reports for the weekly review in the print room Monday morning when Leo appeared so suddenly in the doorway that Jay almost dropped the papers. Leo shut the door behind him.
"Perfect timing. I was hoping to catch you."
"Leo. Did you need something printed?" Jay said warily. Leo's unexpected appearances often meant some form of chaos.
"We need to talk about your upcoming international debut."
"Is there something specific about the Garnet Ridge meeting?"
"Since you'll be our international face alongside Ian, administration needs to arrange some appointments for you."
"Appointments?"
"Tailor and styling. Business expenses, naturally." Leo's said as if this were procedure. "You've done excellent work upgrading your wardrobe—those suits look fantastic on you—but international travel requires special considerations. You need to be absolutely impeccable, match Ian's level of presentation."
The compliment about his appearance made Jay's cheeks warm slightly. Over the past year, he'd invested in better clothing, understanding that his role required a certain standard. It seemed he wasn't wrong. "I wasn't aware there were specific requirements for international meetings."
"Not requirements, exactly. More like unspoken expectations. The clients we're meeting operate at a particular level. Every detail matters. Hair appointment just before you leave with the best stylist in the city. He typically handles executives and politicians. Tailor appointment next week so there's time for any adjustments."
Jay nodded slowly. It made sense, even if it felt overwhelming. "If that's what's needed for the company's image."
"It is. This trip matters more than you realize. Since Ian decided to take you with him, it's clear he cares deeply about you, feels responsible for your success here. I haven't seen him invest this much in someone's development since..." He paused, his expression growing distant. "Well, since he learned some hard lessons about trust and workplace relationships."
"What do you mean?"
"Ian's been different since you arrived. More engaged, less isolated. He smiles occasionally. Small changes, but noticeable ones for someone who spent years in emotional exile. You've been good for him, Jay. Better than I think you realize."
Jay stared at his hands, processing this information. "I'm just doing my job."
"You're doing much more than that, and Ian knows it. Which is why I need to ask something of you." Leo's tone changed, becoming more serious than Jay had ever heard it. "Be mindful of how much he's opened up to you. Ian's history with workplace complications left him... fragile. The last time he allowed someone close, it ended badly. Very badly."
"I would never—"
"I know you wouldn't intentionally cause harm. But Ian has given you access to parts of himself he keeps locked away from everyone else. The late nights, the mentorship, the way he watches out for you—it's not standard procedure." Leo's eyes were intent on Jay's face. "Just be gentle with him. Don't take advantage of your unique position so close to him."
"I don't understand what you're suggesting."
"I'm not suggesting anything. I'm just saying that Ian might be more involved in your success than he'd ever acknowledge, and that kind of emotional investment makes him vulnerable. You have the power to hurt him deeply, Jay. I've seen what that looks like, and I'd rather not see it again."
"Leo, I would never hurt Ian. He's been nothing but kind to me."
"I believe that. Which is exactly why I'm trusting you with this information. Just remember that behind all that composure is someone who cares about you more than he should, probably more than he realizes himself. His heart might be more in your hands than you know."
After Leo departed, Jay returned to his desk, his mind reeling. The implications of Leo's words circled through his thoughts like persistent echoes. The idea that Ian might harbour feelings beyond mentorship had never occurred to him. But now, examined through Leo's lens, certain moments took on new significance. Ian's expression when they worked late together. His attention to Jay's comfort and development.
Jay shook his head, trying to dismiss the spiraling thoughts. It was preposterous. Ian was accomplished, powerful, completely in control of every situation, surrounded by brilliant and beautiful people. The possibility that someone like Jay could matter to him beyond utility was laughable.
But Leo's words forced uncomfortable questions to surface. What if there was something deeper behind those moments of guidance? Ian's patient explanations, his protective interventions, the way he'd arranged this business trip with perfect timing to ease Jay's travel anxiety. Was it simple mentorship, or something more personal?
No. Ian was simply noble, a leader who cared about his team's well-being. Jay was reading too much into Leo's words, letting his meddling create problems where none existed. 
But Leo's warning echoed persistently: Be gentle with his heart.
What if Ian's heart really was in Jay's hands, and there was something fragile there that could be broken? The thought of causing Ian any pain made Jay uneasy. 
The questions multiplied while Jay forced himself to focus on his work, but the seed Leo had planted continued to grow, impossible to ignore. Whatever Ian's feelings might be, Jay was certain of one thing—he would rather die than cause harm to the person who'd given him so much.
Jay felt a renewed sense of purpose burning in his chest. If Ian was truly fragile, if he'd been hurt by betrayal, then Jay would do everything in his power to prove himself worthy of the trust he'd been given. He would be the pillar of support Ian deserved, the one person who would never disappoint him.
The rest of the day was productive. Jay threw himself into covering Max and Luc's responsibilities with even greater determination, ensuring every detail was perfect. One more week until the team returned to full capacity. He would make certain everything ran smoothly.
That evening, as the office emptied, Jay made his way to the kitchen. He'd brought lemons and mint from the fridge, planning to make the lemonade Ian had complimented before. He needed to care for Ian properly, to show through actions what words couldn't express.
He returned to Ian's office with a tall glass, condensation beading on the sides, the scent of fresh citrus filling the air.
"Lemonade," Jay said, setting it on Ian's desk. "I thought you might need a refreshment."
Ian looked up from his laptop, and something passed between them—a moment of recognition that felt deeper than their usual exchanges. Jay's eyes burned with unmistakable determination to provide care, to be worthy of whatever trust Ian had placed in him.
"Thank you." Ian's voice was quieter than usual. "That's very thoughtful."
Ian's fingers wrapped around the glass, and for a moment neither of them moved. Leo's words echoed in their minds—warnings and suggestions that had stirred a torrent of feelings. Jay saw Ian's nobility and felt compelled to prove himself worthy of it. Ian saw Jay's burning desire to care for him and felt himself drowning in feelings he'd tried so hard to contain.
Scene 4
Tailor
The doubled workload made the rest of the week pass quickly. The remaining team worked twelve-hour days just to keep pace with their expanded responsibilities. Jay arrived at seven each morning and rarely left before eight in the evening, living on coffee and the occasional sandwich grabbed between meetings.
Ian maintained the same gruelling schedule, his office light burning late into the night. They barely spoke beyond the essential exchanges of files and brief status updates, but sometimes, when Jay delivered printed reports to Ian's office, their eyes would meet for a moment longer than necessary. When Ian passed Jay's desk on his way to meetings, there was an awareness between them that hadn't existed before—glances that spoke of thoughts neither dared voice.
Friday brought no relief from the chaos, but at least the promise of weekend rest. As Jay packed his things at the end of another exhausting day, he remembered the Saturday appointment Leo had arranged. The tailor visit had slipped from his mind entirely amid the week's demands.
Jay took a taxi on Saturday afternoon, watching the city change as they headed toward the exclusive district. The buildings grew more imposing, the shop fronts more elegant, the pedestrians more perfectly dressed. By the time they reached the most prestigious tailor in the city, Jay's confidence had evaporated entirely.
The shop's exterior was all polished brass and dark wood, with a discreet gold plaque by the door. Through the windows, Jay could see mahogany fixtures and rows of expensive fabrics. He paid the taxi driver and stood on the pavement for a moment, gathering his courage. 
A silver-haired man in an immaculate suit greeted him at the door. "Mr. Hall, I presume? We've been expecting you."
Jay was led through the showroom to a private fitting area, where two assistants waited with measuring tape and notebooks. No one asked his preferences or opinions. Instead, they moved around him, treating him like a mannequin to be dressed.
"Mr. Turner provided very specific instructions," the head tailor informed him as they began taking measurements. "The cuts should highlight your natural assets. Fitted through the waist and seat to accentuate your figure. He was quite particular about the details."
Jay's face burned as the assistants discussed his body in such detached terms. They spoke about "enhancing his appeal" and "drawing attention to his best features" as if he weren't standing right there, as if he were a product being packaged for display.
"Turn around please. Yes, the trousers should definitely be cut to flatter the posterior. Mr. Turner was very clear about that requirement."
The humiliation was suffocating. Jay stood still as they pinned and marked fabric around him, their comments growing more specific and degrading with each adjustment. It became increasingly clear that these weren't standard business suits being designed—they were meant to make him look attractive, appealing, seductive even.
"This fabric," the assistant held up a swatch of wool. "It will complement his complexion while maintaining the appropriate drape to accentuate the desired areas."
"Perfect. We'll need him back next Saturday for the first fitting, then again the following week for final adjustments." The senior tailor made a note. "Mr. Turner's timeline is aggressive, but manageable."
"Three appointments?" Jay's voice cracked slightly.
"Quality takes time. Though I'm sure someone in your position understands the value of Mr. Turner's patronage."
The master tailor finally gave a curt nod, snapping the notebook shut. “You will return in a week at the same time for another round of fittings. Do try to be more relaxed then.”
The dismissal in his tone was unmistakable. Jay wasn't a customer here—he was a project, a favour being done for someone who actually mattered.
Jay managed to thank them and escape to the street, his hands shaking as he called another taxi. The entire experience had been a brutal reminder of his place in this world. He was Leo's entertainment, a joke hire who'd forgotten his station. Whatever Leo had said about Ian's feelings was clearly part of a game Jay couldn't understand.
The taxi dropped him at his neighbourhood, and Jay walked slowly toward his favourite cafe. The streets he knew so well felt like a balm after the afternoon's humiliation. This was his world—modest buildings, places where he belonged.
"Jay!" Fay's face lit up as he entered. "I haven't seen you in ages. The usual?"
"I'd like hot chocolate with extra marshmallows. Rough day."
"Coming right up." Fay busied herself behind the counter. "You look exhausted. That new job still keeping you busy?"
"Constantly. Twelve-hour days this week with people on holiday." Jay accepted the steaming mug. "But it's good work. Challenging."
"That's wonderful. Though I have to say, it's a shame you stopped coming regularly. This place isn't the same without our best customer."
Jay smiled, feeling some of the afternoon's tension ease. "I'll try to visit more often. I've missed this."
They chatted about the ongoing park construction across the street and the new bakery that had opened down the block. Normal conversation with normal people who treated him like a human being.
"You know what? I promise I'll make time to come here more often," Jay said as he finished his drink. "This is still my favourite place in the city."
"It better be." Fay grinned. "See you soon, Jay."
Walking home through his neighbourhood, Jay felt his equilibrium returning. The uptown world of expensive tailors and condescending staff wasn't his reality. This was—unpretentious cafes and friendly conversations, people who knew his name and were glad to see him.
Leo was a schemer and an imp, exactly as Jay had always known. Whatever game he was playing, it was all manipulation, and Jay wouldn't let it affect his relationship with Ian. Ian was noble, worthy of every bit of respect and gratitude. He remained the best man Jay had ever known, but he was also completely out of Jay's league. The patronage Jay received was simple generosity from a man who believed in helping others, nothing more.
Scene 5
End of August
Max and Luc were back at their desks on Monday, the office finally returning to full capacity. The relief was palpable as the team no longer had to stretch across multiple responsibilities.
"Look who decided to show up on time for once. We were placing bets on whether you'd get stranded in some remote village again," Amy called out.
"Hey, last year wasn't my fault. Besides, I promised I'd be back. Some of us take our commitments seriously," Max protested with a grin.
"And some of us take our holidays seriously too. Tell us everything. Did you finally try that bungee jumping thing?" Ela added.
"No, though I did spend three days hiking through coffee plantations with no cell service. Completely worth the digital detox," Max said.
"Coffee plantations? That sounds amazing," Zoe looked up from her keyboard.
"Best coffee I've ever tasted. The farmers taught me about processing methods I'd never heard of." Max launched into enthusiastic descriptions of volcanic soil and fermentation techniques while the team gathered around his desk.
Meanwhile Luc quietly organized his desk. Jay noticed his colleague's subdued demeanour, the way he deflected personal questions with sharp wit whenever anyone asked about his time away.
"Relationship troubles sorted themselves out then?" Kim asked bluntly.
"Oh absolutely. Turns out two weeks stuck together really clarifies things. Amazing how much clarity you can gain when you're constantly arguing about whose turn it is to do dishes."
"Rough holiday?" Jay asked when he joined Luc for coffee in the kitchen.
"Let's just say some problems follow you regardless of geography. Thanks for keeping everything running smoothly while we were gone. I heard you two practically lived here."
Jay felt heat rise in his cheeks at the implication. "Just covering the necessary work."
With the team complete, the frantic pace of recent weeks finally eased. The late summer heat had also broken, leaving behind pleasant temperatures that made the commute bearable again. Jay could finally leave at normal hours, the freedom feeling strange after months of extended overtime.
Monday evening, he still stayed until eight with Ian as they worked through the backlog together, but on Tuesday, he packed up at five sharp.
"Gym night?" Ian asked as Jay gathered his things.
"Yeah. I think Rus might disown me if I come late again. Will you be alright finishing up alone?"
"Of course. Enjoy your workout."
Jay caught something in Ian's expression, but dismissed it as his imagination. Ian was probably relieved to have time to work without interruption.
At the gym, Rus greeted him with raised eyebrows. "Look who's back at a reasonable hour. Thought you'd been abducted by spreadsheets."
"Close enough. Work's been intense lately."
The session felt different from his recent stress-driven workouts. Without the crushing anxiety about his upcoming trip, without the pressure of covering for absent colleagues, Jay enjoyed the physical challenge. His body had grown stronger during the months of consistent training, and he pushed through his routine with vigour.
On Wednesday evening, he went back to Café Lemon, where Fay greeted him cheerfully. "Second visit within one week? I'm honoured."
He studied the seasonal menu, finally ordering the autumn spice latte that Fay had been recommending since its introduction.
"Feeling adventurous today?" Fay asked as she prepared his drink.
"Thought I'd try something different. Work's been crazy lately, but things are finally calming down." Jay accepted the steaming mug gratefully. "This is exactly what I needed."
The latte was perfect—warming spices balanced with smooth coffee, nothing like the sterile perfection of the office's expensive machine. Jay lingered longer than usual, savouring the simple pleasure of unscheduled time.
On Thursday evening, he went to the local swimming complex. The smell of chlorine brought back memories of awkward teenage lessons and the persistent feeling of not quite belonging anywhere.
The water was cooler than expected, but after a few tentative laps, Jay found his rhythm. His technique was rusty but adequate, and the resistance of the water felt soothing after days of mental strain. Other swimmers moved past him, but no one stared or judged. Here, he was just another person trying to get some exercise.
On Friday, he had his second diving lesson. Jay arrived at the pool centre alone this time, Zoe having her own commitments. Ina greeted him with an encouraging smile.
"Ready to work on your buoyancy control today?"
"As ready as I'll ever be. I've been practising the breathing exercises you showed me."
"Excellent. That's half the battle right there."
The lesson went better than the first. Jay managed to stay relaxed underwater, his movements becoming more natural. When he surfaced after successfully completing the emergency ascent drill, Ina was beaming.
"Three more sessions and you'll be ready for open water. You're doing brilliantly."
As Jay packed up to leave, he felt pride in his progress. The October trip no longer seemed impossible—just challenging.
Each afternoon brought something different from the endless office hours he'd grown accustomed to. Normal things that normal people did—exercise, hobbies, simple pleasures. It felt good to reclaim parts of himself that had been buried under spreadsheets and takeaway containers.
The freedom to get his own life back felt wonderful and lonely in equal measure, and he couldn't shake the feeling that something important was slipping away even as he tried to hold onto himself.
Ian never asked Jay to stay. Never said the work couldn't wait. But leaving the office at reasonable hours meant catching Ian's eye as he packed up, seeing something complicated pass across his boss's features. Jay felt torn between the pull of their shared evenings and the need to maintain work-life balance.
Ian watched Jay leave each evening with mounting dismay he couldn't voice. The return to normal hours was logical, healthy even, but Ian missed their companionship terribly. The empty office felt cold without Jay.
Jay deserved a life beyond these walls, friendships and hobbies and experiences that had nothing to do with work. But knowing it was right didn't make the emptiness any easier to bear. Ian should have been happy for him. Instead, he just wanted him back.
Saturday's second tailor appointment loomed with dread. Jay arrived prepared for condescension this time, which made the experience marginally more bearable. The staff remained dismissive, discussing his measurements and alterations as if he weren't present.
"The adjustments are coming along nicely," the senior tailor announced. "The fit through the seat is particularly flattering. Mr. Turner will be pleased."
Jay endured the fitting in silence, counting minutes until he could escape back to reality. One more session in two weeks, and this ordeal would be finished.
The taxi ride home took him through the transition zones of the city—from manicured lawns back to comfortable authenticity. As his building came into view, Jay felt his shoulders relax. It might not have marble floors or designer furnishings, but it was home. His studio apartment with its large windows and view of the small park felt more valuable than any penthouse.
He climbed the stairs to his flat, breathing deeply as he unlocked his door. The space was modest but bright, filled with books and the accumulated comfort of belonging. This was his world—cafes, swimming pools and gym sessions, places where he was himself and not someone who needed to be dressed appropriately for someone else's purposes.
Whatever Leo was scheming, whatever complicated dynamics existed in the rarefied air of Turner & Associates, Jay could survive them as long as he remembered where he truly belonged. Ian might be the finest man he'd ever known, but their worlds were fundamentally different.
