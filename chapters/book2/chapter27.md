Chapter 27: Shared traumas
Scene 1
Blind date
Saturday's gym session began with Jay's immediate need to vent his frustrations to the one person he thought would understand.
"Luc roped me into this blind date thing tonight. I absolutely don't want to do it, but he guilt-tripped me into agreeing."
Rus however seemed quite enthusiastic about the idea. "That's fantastic! Exactly what you should be doing, going out with friends, meeting some girls, having fun. You spend too much time working."
Jay stared at him in dismay. "You're supposed to be on my side here."
Rus clapped him on the shoulder. "I am on your side. That's why I think this is great for you. You need more social life, more dating experience."
"Even you're against me? Ian is the only person who actually supports my desire to avoid this disaster."
"Ian? Wait, that's your boss, right? The one who gave you all that trouble?"
"He never gave me trouble. That was all a misunderstanding."
"Jay, you need to stay away from that guy. This date tonight is exactly what you need to get some perspective."
Jay left the gym feeling thoroughly betrayed. Even Rus, who he had thought was a friend, was pushing him toward this. Ian was the only person who truly understood how uncomfortable this situation made him, and here was Rus warning him away from the one supportive voice in his life.
When he returned home, Rus's words were still echoing in his mind, but his primary emotion was defiance. He didn't want to stay away from Ian. If anything, he would much rather spend the evening with Ian than suffer through what promised to be an excruciating ordeal.
That evening, Jay stood in front of his mirror wearing his most elegant gray three-piece suit, the one that made him feel like someone important. The formal attire was probably excessive for the occasion, but he needed every bit of confidence he could muster. If he was going to survive this evening, he wanted to feel like the best version of himself.
The restaurant was upscale but not intimidating, and Jay arrived to find Luc and his flatmate Gav already waiting with another man he didn't recognize.
"Jay, this is Yan," Luc said, gesturing to a strikingly handsome man who seemed like he was accustomed to being the most interesting person in any room.
Yan's handshake was firm. "The mysterious coworker. Luc's told me you're quite successful."
Before Jay could respond, the women arrived in a flurry of laughter. They were all attractive and seemed friendly enough, but Jay was unable to retain their names beyond the first few seconds of meeting them. The social situation was already overwhelming his processing capacity.
At dinner, Yan dominated the conversation, never doubting his own charm. Jay was content to remain in the background, letting the evening unfold around him without his active participation.
As the wine flowed, however, Yan's comments began to take on a slightly sharper edge.
"You know, with that suit and that serious expression, you look like a funeral director. Very dignified, very... sombre."
Jay felt heat rise in his cheeks while Luc raised an eyebrow at the comment. The women seemed oblivious to the undercurrent, their attention focused on Yan's stories about his various adventures and connections. Jay noticed that one of them, a tall blonde with a bright laugh who might have been named Ana, was paying particular attention to Luc, which seemed to please him considerably.
After dinner, the group relocated to a nearby pub. Luc caught Jay's arm discreetly as they walked.
"I know this isn't your scene, but could you stick it out for just another hour? I don't want to make things weird by leaving too early."
Jay could see that Luc was enjoying Ana's company, and his request seemed reasonable enough. "Fine. One hour."
The new setting was no easier than the restaurant. Gav was growing visibly frustrated as Yan monopolized all three remaining women's attention, leaving both Jay and Gav as unwilling spectators to his performance. Jay ordered a single beer, having no intention of compromising his judgement further.
"Not drinking tonight? Worried about losing control?" Yan asked with mock concern.
"I don't handle alcohol well," Jay replied simply.
"Come on, funeral director. Live a little. You're bringing down the whole energy of the table."
Jay's jaw tightened, but he said nothing. Luc attempted to redirect the conversation, but Yan's attention seemed increasingly focused on Jay.
It was nearly eleven when the disaster struck. Yan, ostensibly rising a little too abruptly from his chair, brushed against one of the women at the table. Her glass tilted, and a splash of red wine landed across Jay’s jacket, blooming into a stain that would not come out easily.
"Oh my God, I'm so sorry! How clumsy of me. I'm absolutely mortified." Yan exclaimed theatrically.
Jay stared down at his ruined suit, the most expensive piece of clothing he owned, the one that had cost him so much embarrassment at the tailor's. The liquid was still spreading across the fabric, and he could smell the sharp scent beginning to set into the wool.
"It's fine. Accidents happen," Jay managed, though his voice was tight with suppressed emotion. Yan's expression made Jay suspect it hadn't been entirely accidental. "I should go. Get this cleaned as soon as possible."
Luc looked up from his conversation with Ana, clearly torn. "Are you sure you're okay?"
"I'm fine. It's just a small stain. Enjoy the rest of your evening."
Jay left the pub without looking back, walking several blocks before finding a small park where he could sit on a bench and properly assess the damage to his suit. The stain was extensive and already setting. Even a cleaning service might not be able to restore the garment completely.
He sat in the November chill and felt the full weight of the evening's misery wash over him. The date had been uncomfortable from the start, he had been subtly mocked and ignored, and now his best suit was possibly destroyed.
On impulse, he pulled out his phone and sent a text to Ian: "The evening did go badly."
His phone rang immediately.
"Do you need to be picked up?" Ian sounded concerned, and spoke with no preamble or social pleasantries.
Jay was surprised by the immediate response. "I don't want to impose. It's late and—"
"Where are you?" Ian interrupted, and Jay could hear the sound of keys jingling. "I'm already heading to my car."
"You don't have to—" Jay's voice cracked slightly, betraying the emotional strain he was trying to hide.
"Just give me the location. I'll be there immediately."
Jay provided the address of the park, then hung up feeling simultaneously foolish for calling and overjoyed that Ian cared enough to respond so quickly. Before he had time to fully regret his decision or work himself into greater anxiety about imposing on Ian's evening, headlights appeared at the street corner.
Ian's car pulled up to the curb, and Jay stood from the bench, weighed down by a thoroughly disappointing evening. Whatever happened next, at least he wouldn't have to face the journey home alone.
Scene 2
Rescue
As Jay got into Ian's car, the first words out of his mouth were profuse apologies, his speech slightly slurred by the alcohol.
"I'm so sorry for calling you out like this. I know it's late and you probably had plans and I just—"
"It's nothing," Ian interrupted, pulling away from the curb. "Are you alright? That's what matters."
Jay slumped against the passenger seat. "I'm fine, but my best suit is ruined."
Ian glanced at the dark stain spreading across Jay's jacket. "It's red wine, right? I know a good emergency cleaner nearby. They might be able to save it. Wine stains aren't unusual, they definitely have experience with this kind of thing."
The drive took less than five minutes, barely enough time for Jay to process what was happening before Ian was pulling up outside a small shop with bright lights still on.
"Emergency dry cleaning. They specialize in situations exactly like this."
The woman behind the counter examined the stain. "We can probably manage this. The important thing is that you got here quickly. The longer these things sit, the harder they become to treat."
"It feels a bit like emergency surgery for a beloved hamster," Jay said with a weak smile.
Ian was relieved at Jay's attempt at humour. At least he seemed to be recovering from whatever had upset him earlier.
"Should I drive you home now?" Ian asked as they returned to the car.
Jay looked down at himself, white shirt, vest, no jacket, and shook his head. "I actually need a drink first. Though I probably look like a newspaper delivery boy."
"Not at all. You look charming. I know just the place that will accommodate us."
Ten minutes later they were sitting at the bar of a small pub in a more upscale district, with dim lights and live music. Jay still felt awkward about his incomplete outfit, but the atmosphere was welcoming enough.
Ian ordered whisky for both of them, then paused. "You don't actually like whisky, do you."
"I've heard it's an acquired taste," Jay replied, accepting the glass. "Seems like a good moment to do some acquiring."
Ian smiled despite his concern. "What happened tonight?"
Jay took a sip of the whisky and grimaced slightly. "The whole evening was awkward. Some arrogant guy spent the night telling me I looked like a funeral director, among other charming observations. Then he managed to spill wine all over my jacket. But at least Luc seemed to hit it off with one of the women, so the night wasn't a complete loss for everyone."
"The man was probably jealous. You looked good tonight. You still look good."
Jay laughed bitterly. "Jealous of what? He looked like a movie star himself."
"Secure men don't feel the need to prop themselves up by putting others down."
Jay drained the rest of his whisky in one swallow and signaled for another. Ian watched with growing concern as Jay's caution around alcohol seemed to have completely disappeared.
"What's wrong? You normally don't drink at all, and definitely not like this."
Jay accepted his second drink and met Ian's eyes directly. "I never drink because being drunk makes me vulnerable to other people taking advantage of me. But that's not really a concern when you're around, is it? So I might as well indulge. Besides, I need to kill the bad taste this evening left. Maybe it can even be salvaged after all."
His phone buzzed with a text from Luc asking if he was alright. Jay typed back quickly: "Fine. Took jacket to emergency cleaner, having a drink in a pub with a friend."
On impulse, he held up his phone for a selfie, capturing both himself and a surprised-looking Ian in the frame. He wanted to send it to Luc, but seemed to change his mind before pressing the button.
"Drinking makes you much more relaxed," Ian observed, looking puzzled by the sudden photo.
"I know. My defences go way down. That's exactly why it's so dangerous for me to drink." Jay's honesty was so casual, so trusting, that Ian felt an overwhelming wave of affection that was getting hard to suppress.
Jay ordered another drink despite Ian's attempts to slow him down.
"I rarely have a chance like this, and I really need it right now," Jay insisted, and Ian was unable to refuse when Jay was clearly still processing the evening's disappointment.
But within half an hour, Jay had consumed four more whiskies and was visibly intoxicated, his words slurring and his coordination becoming unreliable.
"I think it's time to get you home," Ian said, signaling for the check and calling a taxi.
The taxi ride required some management as Jay dozed fitfully against Ian's shoulder. When they reached Jay's building, Ian realized the full scope of his challenge: four flights of stairs with an intoxicated man who could barely stand independently.
Ian briefly contemplated taking Jay to his own place instead, but that seemed like an overreach. Instead, he half-dragged Jay up the stairs, pausing frequently to readjust his grip and catch their breath. By the time they reached Jay's door, Ian was thankful for every hour he spent sweating at the gym.
He had to search Jay's pockets for keys while supporting his weight, a process that felt deeply invasive. Jay was cooperative, but clearly had no real awareness of what was happening around him.
Once inside the small apartment, Jay immediately collapsed onto the couch as if his strings had been cut. Ian stood uncertainly in the doorway, torn between leaving Jay to sleep it off alone and staying to monitor his condition. The proper thing would be to leave, staying overnight would be presumptuous at best, potentially catastrophic at worst.
But worry won out over other considerations. Jay was more intoxicated than Ian had ever seen him, and leaving him alone felt unconscionable.
Ian helped Jay out of his shirt and suit, providing water and gentle encouragement to drink small sips between Jay's protests that he was fine. Getting Jay from the couch to his bed required more physical support, but Jay remained cooperative even as he mumbled incoherent responses to Ian's instructions.
"Just sleep it off," Ian murmured, making sure Jay was positioned safely on his side with water within reach. "Everything will look better in the morning."
With Jay put to bed, Ian stretched out on the couch that had dominated the small space. His heart was still racing from the evening's events, from the phone call that had sent him rushing across the city to this moment of lying in Jay's apartment listening to his unsteady breathing.
Ian stared at the ceiling and acknowledged that he had crossed several lines tonight. But Jay had trusted him enough to call when he needed help, had been vulnerable enough to admit that Ian made him feel safe, and Ian couldn't regret any of it. 
Ian pulled a blanket over himself, doubting he would actually sleep but content to maintain his protective vigil until Jay was safely recovered.
Scene 3
Accepting help
Jay woke to a splitting headache and the sensation that someone had replaced his brain with broken glass. He pressed his palms against his temples and tried to piece together the fragments of the previous evening. The blind date. The wine stain. Calling Ian. Then... nothing. A void where his memory should be.
He rolled over with a pitiful moan, trying to understand how he had gotten home, when he heard a voice from somewhere nearby.
"Take these. They'll help with the pain."
Jay's eyes snapped open to find Ian standing beside his bed, holding out painkillers and a glass of water. The sight sent Jay into instant panic. He practically launched himself upright, suddenly aware that he was wearing nothing but his underwear, then scrambled backward until his shoulders hit the wall, pulling his sheets around himself in a desperate attempt at modesty.
"What—how did I— Ian, I'm so sorry, I don't remember—"
Ian immediately stepped back, alarm crossing his features. "Jay, you're safe. Nothing happened. I promise you're completely safe."
The fear in Jay's eyes startled Ian, who had never imagined that he might be interpreted as threatening. He backed away further, putting as much distance as possible between himself and the bed.
The reassurance in Ian's voice only made Jay's panic worse, but for entirely different reasons than Ian suspected. The terrible reality was dawning on him: he had apparently made Ian Hagen stay overnight in his cramped, messy studio apartment. The most refined man he knew had been forced to sleep on Jay's tiny, uncomfortable couch. It was unthinkable.
"Did you sleep here? On my couch?"
"Jay, let me explain—"
"Oh God." Jay buried his face in his hands. "Ian, I'm so sorry. How could I let this happen? You shouldn't have had to—"
Ian raised his hands in a calming gesture. "You called me when you needed help. You were quite intoxicated, and it didn't feel safe to leave you alone. I made the decision to stay. But I can leave right now if that would make you more comfortable."
"No!" Jay's head shot up. "I mean—wait. Just give me a minute to process this disaster."
Ian watched with growing confusion as Jay's distress seemed to have nothing to do with impropriety and everything to do with hosting arrangements. "Take the painkillers first. Please."
Jay accepted the pills and water, downing both gratefully. Ian watched him for a moment, then asked, "Would you like coffee?"
"You don't need to wait on me," Jay protested, attempting to scramble to his feet. "I can—"
"Lay down and rest," Ian said firmly, placing a gentle hand on Jay's shoulder to stop him.
Jay collapsed back against his pillow with a miserable groan, pulling the covers over his head.
Ian sat on the bed, speaking in the same tone he might use to soothe a skittish animal. "It's okay to let friends help when you need it. That's what friends are for. There's no shame in needing assistance, and it's not a burden on the people who care about you."
While Ian went to make coffee, Jay remained hidden under his covers, wrestling with the magnitude of his mortification. When Ian returned and set a mug on the bedside table, Jay finally emerged enough to accept it.
Ian sat on the couch with his own cup, giving Jay space to process. After several minutes of silence, Jay managed to drink some coffee and eventually wobbled to his feet.
"I'm going to take a shower," he mumbled, disappearing into the bathroom.
The cold water helped clear his head somewhat, and when he emerged wearing sweatpants and a t-shirt, he felt better. He sat at his small table and looked at Ian with an intense expression.
"Are you feeling like eating breakfast?" Ian asked.
"I feel like dying," Jay replied flatly.
"Is the hangover that severe?"
Jay shook his head miserably. "I can't believe I made you sleep on that awful couch. Ian, I'm so sorry. The indignity of it. The sheer presumption."
Ian set down his coffee cup. "You didn't make me do anything. You were frankly not in any position to make decisions. It was entirely my choice. I apologize if I overstepped and made you uncomfortable."
"I'm not uncomfortable," Jay said quickly. "I'm mortified at my audacity. Making my boss escort my drunk self home and stay over in my uncomfortable studio—"
Ian laughed softly. "I did it as your friend, not your boss. And if I recall correctly, you did the same thing quite recently for Luc. So you must be familiar with the general concept."
"That's not the same thing."
"How so?"
Jay looked at him with exasperated disbelief. "You know why. You're... well, you're too well-bred for dilapidated accommodations like this."
Ian's laugh was more amused now. He stood up and moved toward Jay's small kitchen. "I'm making eggs for breakfast."
"Ian, you don't have to—"
"I actually lived in a studio even smaller than this one for years," Ian said, dismissing Jay's protests as he began searching through cupboards. "When my father threw me out after the scandal, I was told to leave immediately and never return. I didn't even have a chance to gather my belongings. I left my childhood home with literally nothing but the clothes on my back."
Jay stared at him, stunned into silence.
Ian continued as he worked, cracking eggs into a pan. "All my accounts were cancelled within hours. I didn't have a single penny to my name. I had to sell my watch just to have enough money to rent a place to stay. At first, I stayed in the cheapest hotel I could find, then I rented a run-down studio in a far worse part of the city than this. I lived there for eight years, until I had accumulated enough assets to comfortably buy my own apartment."
"Eight years?"
"I didn't even have a bed, unlike you. I slept on a couch that wasn't much more comfortable than yours. During that time, I quickly accepted that my old life was over, and honestly, I was too heartbroken to care much about material comfort. I was resigned to working as a waiter or whatever employment I could find."
Jay felt his world tilting slightly. He had known about the disownment, but he had never pondered the practical realities. He had assumed Ian must have had some kind of safety net, some resources to fall back on.
"Leo found me before I could sink that far. He offered me a position, but at first I was too proud to accept help. It was Leo who gave me the speech about accepting assistance from friends—almost word for word what I just told you. I'm glad I listened to him, because it allowed me to build a life with my own hands. Looking back, I realize he was right. Being unwilling to accept help during your darkest moments is unwise."
Ian finished cooking and served the eggs, setting a plate in front of Jay along with fresh coffee. Jay took a tentative bite and his eyes widened in surprise. The food was perfectly prepared, seasoned just right, and Jay stared at Ian with complete astonishment.
"You're an incredible cook."
Ian smiled as he sat down with his own plate. "During those years, I cooked, cleaned, did laundry—all the normal things everyone else does. It was a sobering experience that showed me exactly how privileged I had been growing up, having servants attend to every need."
Jay ate slowly, partly because of his lingering nausea but mostly because he was processing this revelation. As he watched Ian across the small table—this man he had admired for so long—Jay realized that despite everything he thought he knew about Ian's history, he had barely scratched the surface. Every new piece of information only deepened his respect.
Ian had survived complete rejection by his family, had built himself back up from nothing, and had somehow emerged from that experience with his integrity intact. And now he was sitting in Jay's modest apartment, making breakfast and treating Jay's hungover as if it was the most natural thing in the world.
"Thank you," Jay said softly. "For last night. For staying. For... everything."
"That's what friends do."
Scene 4
Deepening bonds
After they finished eating, Jay insisted on cleaning up despite Ian's protests that he should rest. The domestic task helped clear the last of the fog from his mind, and he moved more steadily as the painkillers and food worked their magic.
The atmosphere lightened as Jay assessed his clothes from the previous evening, which Ian had thoughtfully hung on the closet doors instead of leaving them crumpled on the floor.
"Your housing situation really is dire," Ian observed, gesturing toward the tower of suitcases dominating the centre of the room and the clothing overflowing from every available storage space.
Jay followed his gaze ruefully. "I know. I've been apartment hunting all week, but I keep running into problems with every option. Too expensive, too small, bad location, questionable building maintenance. There's always something."
Ian listened as Jay outlined his various concerns and criteria, then reached into his wallet and produced a business card.
"This is someone I know. He's a reliable real estate agent who specializes in finding good value in overlooked properties. He might be able to show you some interesting options."
Jay accepted the card hesitantly. "Ian, I'm already imposing on you so much. I can't keep asking for favours."
"That's hardly imposing. I thought I explained quite emphatically that our circumstances aren't really all that different. You don't need to look at me with such reverence. I just had more time to establish myself, and perhaps a slightly easier start. Though I'm not entirely certain about the easier start, because while my material conditions were initially better, you at least have a family who cares about you."
Jay went quiet for a moment, processing this perspective. "Your family really is awful. To abandon you when you needed them most. It's unconscionable."
Ian's response was almost reflexive. "I don't blame them. It was my own fault what happened. I deserved the consequences."
Jay stared at him in horror. "You deserved nothing of the sort! You were a victim. You were used by an unscrupulous man, and instead of comforting you in your pain, your family threw you out. They're awful people."
"In my circles, there are certain expectations about being mindful at all times—"
"I don't care about high society expectations." Jay's anger was building, his voice taking on an edge Ian had never heard before. "You were betrayed by someone you trusted, and instead of receiving support, you were punished for being human. That's not how decent people behave. That's just cruelty."
Ian looked sad and somewhat defeated, but he didn't budge from his position. "I got exactly what I deserved."
Jay stared at him with obvious frustration, then moved to the couch with a distinctly grumpy expression. "You want to talk about deserving consequences? Let me tell you about my first job. My first boss was wonderful. Charming, attentive, supportive. I thought I'd struck gold with this amazing mentor who was going to guide my career. Until after a company party where I got drunk, and he pushed himself on me. A married man with children."
Ian went very still. Though he had known this story from Jay's background check, hearing it directly was entirely different.
"I cried, I protested, I managed to get away before he could... complete what he intended. But afterwards, he told me I had asked for it. That it was obvious I wanted his attention, so I shouldn't play coy. I went to HR, but they dismissed my complaint entirely. So I quit immediately."
Jay was quiet for a moment, lost in the memory. 
"I wasn't in a good financial position. High rent, minimal savings, and the job search was brutal. I had to swallow my pride and call my mother for help. I didn't want to explain what happened, but I was so distraught that it all came spilling out. Do you know what she told me? She called him a pig. A bastard and a lowlife. She said of course she'd send money, that it wasn't my fault. She didn't say I should have been more careful or that I'd brought it on myself. She recognized I was a victim, just like you were. And that's how family should respond."
Jay met Ian's eyes directly. "Mind you, I wasn't particularly close to my mother at that point. But she still knew right from wrong. She still protected her child when he needed it most."
Ian sat in silence, processing Jay's words. Hearing Jay's personal account, seeing the trust Jay was placing in him by sharing this trauma, it felt monumental. Ian wanted to respond appropriately, to honour that trust with the right words, but he felt overwhelmed by the responsibility.
The silence stretched, and Jay watched Ian's expression, sad and confused, as if he were wrestling with concepts that challenged his fundamental beliefs. Jay's heart ached watching Ian struggle with ideas that should have been simple.
"Get up," Jay said suddenly.
Ian looked puzzled. "What?"
"I'm going to hug you now, if that's okay."
Ian nodded, still confused, and rose from his chair. Jay enveloped him in a warm, encompassing embrace, complete with a gentle pat on the back.
"It was not your fault," Jay said firmly into Ian's ear. "I'm sorry you were surrounded by people so awful they made you think you had to shoulder all of that guilt yourself. The man who wronged you was a pig, and you don't need to make excuses for any of them." He pulled back slightly to meet Ian's eyes. "Maybe Leo really isn't as bad as I thought. I might need to reassess my opinion of him."
They broke apart, and Ian's voice was quiet when he responded. "Thank you. And what happened to you was terrible. I'm sorry you went through that."
Jay shrugged with forced casualness. "We all have our stories that shaped us into the men we are."
The moment suddenly felt heavy. They had each shared their deepest trauma, their most vulnerable experiences, and the weight of that trust hung between them as they looked into each other's eyes.
Jay's phone buzzed, breaking the moment. He glanced at the screen with a grimace. "It's Luc, checking if I made it home alright and apologizing that the evening turned sour." He looked up with a snarky expression. "The main architect of yesterday's disaster has no shame acting so nonchalant."
He typed back: "Hangover is killing me. Whether I forgive you depends on how good a job the cleaner does."
The mention of the jacket reminded them both of their pending errand. "We should go retrieve your suit," Ian said. "I need to collect my car from the pub anyway."
"Ian, I really don't want to impose—"
Ian gave him a pointed look. "We just discussed the imposing issue, didn't we?"
Jay changed into more presentable clothes, and they took a taxi to the pub to collect Ian's car before driving to the emergency cleaner. Jay held his breath as the woman behind the counter brought out his suit jacket. It looked pristine, with no trace of the previous evening's accident.
Jay's relief was palpable. "It looks like new! Thank you so much."
As they left the shop, Jay turned to Ian with determination. "The least I can do is buy you lunch. After everything you've done..."
Ian seemed pleased. "I'd like that very much."
Scene 5
Weekend plans
They chose a nearby restaurant that looked cosy enough and ordered simple but well-prepared dishes. As they waited for their food, Jay got curious about Ian's eating habits.
"I have to ask. What's the deal with your meal service? I know you have everything delivered according to detailed specifications."
"I've always been fairly serious about staying fit, and at this point it's easier to outsource meal planning to ensure consistency with my training requirements."
"Are you very strict about it?"
"Not obsessive. I don't mind adjusting when circumstances call for it. I never skip business lunches or social occasions. But on regular days, I stick to the meal plan. It serves me well, and it's one less decision to make. I don't really miss having to cook."
"I feel terrible about taking up so much of your weekend. You had to make concessions on your meals, probably your gym schedule, all to babysit me."
Ian's response was delivered with perfect deadpan seriousness. "Yes, it's quite tragic. I was right in the middle of updating spreadsheet templates for the annual reporting cycle in January. Whatever will I do now?"
Jay laughed, assuming it was a joke, then gradually realized Ian's expression hadn't changed. "Wait, you're serious. You were actually going to spend your Sunday working on spreadsheets?"
"I generally spend weekends on exercise and non-urgent work projects. It helps ensure business operations run smoothly."
Jay stared at him in horror. "What about leisure time? Surely you must take some time to just... relax?"
"I do gym sessions. That's quite enough recreational activity."
"Ian. That's not leisure. That's still self-improvement."
Ian seemed puzzled by Jay's reaction, which only made Jay more worried. He had already been concerned about Ian's working habits during the week, but this revelation painted an even more troubling picture.
An idea began forming in Jay's mind. Half teasing, half serious, he said, "What if I came over next Saturday and helped with those spreadsheets? Then you'd have no excuse but to take Sunday off."
He didn't really expect Ian to agree to such a suggestion, but Ian was looking at him as if he was considering it.
"You cannot possibly mean that."
"I owe you for everything you've done, and I won't let you waste all your weekends on paperwork. Besides, spreadsheets aren't torture when you have good company."
Ian hesitated, clearly torn. "I don't want you to feel obligated—"
"I don't feel obligated."
Ian seemed to wrestle with the offer for several moments. "You don't need to push yourself. Only come if you don't have anything better to do."
Jay felt unexpected excitement. He hadn't really thought Ian would entertain the idea. "As long as you don't mind having me there, I don't mind coming. Actually, I'd enjoy it."
"Then... yes. That would be helpful."
Their food arrived, providing a brief intermission in the conversation. After a few bites, Jay felt oddly emboldened by the atmosphere and their growing closeness. 
"What do you plan to do with your free Sunday then?"
"I haven't given it much thought."
Jay narrowed his eyes suspiciously. "You're not really planning to relax at all, are you? You're going to find more work to do."
"I don't do hard work at home. Just less pressing matters," Ian protested weakly.
"That's still work!" Jay threw up his hands in dramatic exasperation. "Should I make plans for Sunday too, just to ensure you actually rest?"
Jay wasn't sure if he was overstepping badly, but Ian gave the suggestion serious thought.
"If you want to be certain I take the day off, you probably should make plans. I'm not entirely sure I know how to spend a whole day without some form of productive activity."
Jay rolled his eyes. "We're going to have to fix that. I have a week to think of something appropriately relaxing. If nothing else comes to mind, I'll just book another fencing session."
"That went so well the last time."
"Hey, everyone else enjoyed it. My complete humiliation was apparently highly entertaining."
When they finished their meal, Ian drove Jay home. Jay retrieved his rescued jacket from Ian's car and returned to his apartment, feeling strangely energized. It had been an unusually intense weekend, and he wasn't sure if he felt distressed or exhilarated.
The sudden closeness with Ian felt both precious and fragile. He knew he was imposing, but he was overjoyed Ian allowed it. He was surprised by his own forwardness in inserting himself into Ian's weekend schedule like this.
Rus's warning echoed in his mind—that he shouldn't get so close to his boss. Sound, prudent advice that he agreed with completely and chose to disregard entirely. He wanted to get closer to Ian, as close as he was allowed to be. He didn't care if it was foolish.
Standing in front of his bathroom mirror, Jay studied his reflection. When had he become so reckless? But as he asked himself the question, he discovered it didn't matter. It felt good. It felt right.
Meanwhile, Ian felt far less conflicted about the development. He felt blessed. He had wanted to get closer to Jay, and the universe had helped him achieve that goal. Now he had plans with Jay—an entire weekend together.
The memory of Jay's embrace, of his protectiveness, made his heart race. But Ian held no illusions about his position. Jay's story had served as a stark reminder—Jay trusted him precisely because he knew Ian would never touch him. It didn't matter. Ian had never harboured any romantic notions anyway.
He tried not to get his hopes up too much, knowing that disappointment would be crushing if Jay changed his mind or if the weekend turned awkward, but he couldn't help himself. He had something to look forward to. He had Jay coming to his apartment, Jay concerned about his well-being, Jay taking charge of his recreational activities.
The thought made Ian smile as he opened his laptop, finally turning to those spreadsheet templates that had been interrupted by much more important matters.

It was going to be wonderful.
