Chapter 30: Winter lights
Scene 1
Anticipation
December continued busily with finishing projects, preparing for annual reporting, and organizing for the holiday season when traditionally only a skeleton crew remained. The intense workload provided exactly the distraction Jay needed, forcing him to focus on immediate tasks instead of dwelling on major life decisions. He barely managed to squeeze in his Tuesday gym sessions.
Ian was naturally delighted to have Jay practically living in the office again. He savoured their extended time together, from early morning project reviews to late evening coffee conversations. The prospect of spending Christmas with Jay filled him with anticipation that not even the persistently wet, gloomy weather could dampen. The Christmas lights throughout the office seemed unusually beautiful this year, casting everything in a warm, festive glow.
Jay's mood had improved as well. The idea of moving was gradually becoming less terrifying as he grew accustomed to the possibility. At the very least, a new apartment would provide proper space for a Christmas tree.
Soon it was time for the annual Christmas party. The invitations had arrived much earlier, but they no longer required extensive preparations. Jay wore the midnight blue suit he'd bought for his first company function. It felt low-key now, even modest. He had to admit that properly tailored outfits felt completely different. There was nothing majorly wrong with it, but there was a feeling that it worked against him when he moved, notably absent with his tailored pieces. 
Jay smiled to himself with mild amazement. Was he seriously developing an appreciation for quality tailoring? It seemed an unexpected evolution in his personal standards.
The party maintained its traditional grandeur, held at an elegant old-world hotel with opulent decorations that created a properly festive atmosphere. Jay laughed with his team, engaging in conversations about food quality with Max and Luc.
"The catering was definitely superior last year," Jay insisted.
Max nodded. "Absolutely. This year's selection lacks the creative flair we've come to expect."
Luc remained diplomatic. "I honestly can't detect much difference between years. Good food is good food."
He chatted with Ian when Ian came to hang out with them, avoided Leo whenever he spotted him, and even spent time with the administrative department, with whom he maintained friendly relations. The atmosphere was relaxed, and so was Jay.
After dinner, Turner Senior delivered his traditional speech, followed by the distribution of holiday gifts. The customary basket contained high-end foods, imported sweets, and premium alcohol, but unlike the spa voucher from last year, this time it was a ten thousand voucher to a jewellery store.
"Almost enough for a nice watch," Luc commented, and Jay wasn't sure if it was appreciation or sarcasm.
"I'll get something lovely for the missus," Max declared. 
Ela and Amy immediately began animated discussions about gemstone preferences. Kim listened with attention, perhaps even discreetly taking notes on his phone, which prompted knowing grins between Jay and Luc.
Only Zoe seemed disappointed. "I would have preferred a voucher for a sports equipment store," she said mournfully.
Jay immediately decided to use his voucher for family gifts. He knew virtually nothing about jewellery, and the obscenely expensive watch he wore daily remained his most treasured possession. He didn't want another.
He used the weekend for gift shopping. He called his mother first, to officially confirm his absence from Christmas celebrations, apologizing for the decision while explaining the demands of his position.
"My boss traditionally works extended hours during this period, so naturally I'm expected to do the same," Jay explained, feeling only slightly guilty about the creative interpretation. "But I promise to visit in spring when things are less hectic, and I'm sending gifts for everyone to make it up to you."
His siblings had thoughtfully provided detailed wish lists, clearly comfortable with the idea that their successful brother should indulge them appropriately.
For Ema, he purchased cosmetics whose purposes remained mysterious despite the sales clerk's commentary. Jay listened politely but registered none of the technical information about application techniques or seasonal colour preferences.
Ari had requested three specific building block sets, all space-themed. Jay decided to purchase all three, since they cost less combined than Ema's cosmetic collection.
Tim's camping supply requests were the most challenging, requiring visits to several specialty stores before Jay found equipment that matched the specifications.
He added a bottle of premium whiskey for his stepfather and an elegant perfume for his mother. While at the fragrance counter, he also inquired about the men's cologne selection. The helpful saleswoman presented him with many samples. Some were overpowering, others too old-fashioned, but he eventually chose something light and herbal for himself. It was expensive, so he hoped he hadn't blundered by choosing something embarrassingly unsophisticated. He'd wanted to buy cologne for a long time but never had the opportunity, and now seemed as good a moment as ever.
At the jewellery store, Jay requested five pieces for his family members, providing basic descriptions but leaving specific selections to the clerk's judgement. The voucher covered everything, resulting in a watch for his stepfather, chains with emblems for his brothers, and earrings and necklaces for his mother and sister. Jay suspected his brothers might not appreciate jewellery, but wanted to divide the voucher equitably. At minimum, they would have meaningful mementos. Everything got beautifully packaged and shipped to his family immediately.
This left him with the most difficult purchase: a gift for Ian. What did you buy for your wealthy boss whom you respected and admired, but who already possessed everything? It had to be personal and thoughtful.
He discovered a store selling ridiculously expensive but beautiful lighters. He wasn't particularly fond of Ian's occasional smoking, but sometimes situations seemed to call for it. Jay selected the most refined option available, barely flinching at the cost, and arranged for custom engraving: "You've got this." 
The message was intended to encourage Ian when things became difficult. It felt slightly cheesy but sufficiently personal. He hoped he wasn't overstepping.
He also purchased a box of exquisite crystal tree ornaments to bring to Ian's apartment, along with ingredients for baking a Christmas cake. His apartment lacked an oven and his baking experience was minimal, but he wanted to have homemade pastries to create a properly festive celebration.
Spending so much money no longer bothered him—it was a special occasion that warranted celebration, and he could afford it comfortably. Christmas was approaching, and he would spend it with the one person whose company he valued most. It was going to be magical.
Scene 2
Christmas Day
With Christmas approaching fast, everyone at work was busy tying up loose ends. On the last day before the holidays, customary wishes and farewells were exchanged. Jay received enthusiastic embraces from both Max and Amy, who made their annual rounds hugging everyone. Luc delivered a teary-eyed speech about his first Christmas alone in years, though Jay suspected he'd actually found company judging from his smug smile.
Ian also made his rounds, offering holiday wishes to everyone. He approached Jay at the end, and Jay said conspiratorially, "We can save the wishes for tomorrow. Do you have a tree?"
When Ian shook his head, Jay declared, "You have to arrange one. We can decorate it tomorrow."
They parted ways in excellent moods, exchanging secretive smiles.
The next morning, Jay woke early and took an unreasonably long shower. He called his mother while eating breakfast, receiving profuse thanks for the gifts. 
"The jewellery is absolutely beautiful. Ema is practically squealing about hers. And the boys are already building with those space sets. Just promise me you'll take care of yourself. Don't work too hard over the holidays."
"I promise."
Then came the challenge of preparing for the day ahead. Choosing his outfit was more difficult than expected. He wanted to look nice but not overly formal. Three-piece suits seemed like overkill, especially since he'd be cooking. But sweatpants were absolutely out of the question, and his standard office attire felt boring for such a special occasion. He finally decided on the extravagant designer outfit that had cost him a fortune, way too silky and form-fitting for his conservative sensibilities, but it surely wouldn't be a problem around Ian. If it got ruined while cooking, well, that was a risk he was willing to take.
A single spray of his new cologne finished the preparations. He examined himself in the mirror from every angle. He had to admit he looked good.
He packed everything needed and took a taxi to Ian's right after breakfast. His heart was beating far too rapidly for what was ostensibly just a friendly Christmas dinner. It was barely past ten when he arrived. He wasn't sure if he was too early, but rang anyway, and Ian answered immediately.
"Come up."
Ian opened the door wearing a cream cashmere sweater and dark slacks—probably the first time Jay had seen him in anything resembling casual wear. Still elegant but more approachable, and he looked absolutely stunning. 
Jay had to pause, then dropped his eyes and blushed when he realized he was staring. Ian had a similar reaction to Jay's appearance, since his outfit highlighted every line of his body, but managed to conceal his response more successfully.
"Merry Christmas," they said simultaneously, then laughed at their synchronicity.
Jay unpacked ingredients in the kitchen, taking in the scene Ian had prepared. A gorgeous evergreen stood ready for decoration, boxes of ornaments waited nearby, and Christmas jazz played in the background.
"I managed to find a tree yesterday evening. And I have some ornaments, though not many."
"I brought additional ones," Jay said, taking out his box.
They began with the tree, working in intimate proximity as they wound white garlands through the branches, occasionally exchanging loaded glances. Ian caught Jay's new scent and couldn't help commenting.
"That cologne suits you perfectly."
Jay grew shy. "I hope it's not too strong."
"Not at all. It's lovely."
Their tree turned into an enchanting composition, and both smiled as they stepped back.
Next they moved to the kitchen, and soon the air filled with scents of cinnamon and cloves as Jay prepared a traditional cake while Ian started the Christmas dinner preparations. Ian produced matching aprons, which sent Jay into delighted laughter.
"Seriously? These are adorable."
"I wanted this to feel domestic."
"I haven't baked anything since I was a child. My grandmother used to let me help with Christmas cookies," Jay admitted as he was folding flour.
"I've never baked at all. This is entirely uncharted territory."
They moved around each other with surprising coordination. While the cake baked, Jay chopped vegetables to assist Ian, who handled the more complex frying and stuffing. Jay stole glances at Ian as he moved between the stove and counter, sleeves rolled up, completely focused on the task at hand.
"I keep marvelling at your skill. I can feed myself adequately, but you're in a completely different league. Is there anything you're not good at?" Jay asked.
"Plenty of things. But cooking isn't one of them. During those long solitary evenings in my studio, on nights when I was already sick of working, I had nothing else to do but practice."
They finished preparations, setting the table with food far too abundant for two people, but both wanted to make the occasion special. Ian lit candles and opened good wine, making the atmosphere properly festive.
They sat, ate, and exchanged stories about their cooking attempts and food preferences. Jay's cake turned out acceptable—a tiny bit dry, but he was pleased his first serious baking attempt wasn't a disaster. 
"Not bad for someone without an oven," Ian declared, examining their creation.
"It's edible, which exceeds my expectations."
Ian's cooking was, naturally, delicious.
When they were comfortably full, they moved to the couch for gift exchange. Jay felt suddenly unsure about his choice.
Ian unwrapped the package, looking surprised. "A lighter?"
Jay fumbled for words. "I know you don't smoke regularly, and frankly I'm not fond of the habit, but it seems during stressful situations it can't be helped. So at the very least, I wanted you to have a reminder that you've been through worse and always emerged successful."
"How do you even know I smoke?"
"Why wouldn't I know? I can smell the lingering scent on you during particularly difficult negotiations."
Ian felt deeply touched, not just by the gesture but by Jay's attentiveness. "I promise to use it as infrequently as possible."
"I'm happy to hear that."
Ian's gift came in an elegant jewelry box—cufflinks with small sapphires and a matching tie pin, beautiful and clearly expensive.
Jay was speechless for a moment, his eyes growing glossy. "It's beautiful. I... I've never owned anything like this."
"It will look perfect on you," Ian reassured him. "You'll need a dedicated shirt for the cufflinks, but they should complement your navy three-piece brilliantly for formal occasions. Probably your tuxedo for the upcoming gala as well."
Jay groaned at the mention of the gala. "Don't remind me of that disaster."
"If anyone bothers you at all, find me immediately. Or punch them directly—I'll take responsibility."
Jay laughed, delighted by Ian's sudden militant attitude. "I definitely won't be punching anyone. If I were the punching type, I'd probably have much less trouble in life."
"Perhaps. But the option remains available."
"Let's watch something," Jay said, and they selected a heartwarming Christmas film.
They lounged on the couch with wine and leftover treats. As the afternoon progressed and Jay drank more, he grew increasingly talkative, grumbling about his family in an exaggerated way.
"My siblings are absolutely shameless. I spent years babysitting those ungrateful brats when I was a teenager, and now they coerce expensive gifts out of me."
He caught himself mid-rant. "Though I have no right to complain, given how awful your family was to you. Speaking of which, your father sounds like an absolute—"
"Jay," Ian interrupted gently, but he was clearly amused by the sudden outburst.
"Right, sorry. I get whiny when I drink."
Ian monitored Jay's alcohol consumption, ensuring he didn't go overboard and stayed pleasantly relaxed. They spent the evening talking about nothing in particular, surrounded by their feast and watching sentimental movies. It was perfect. Both looked at each other with barely concealed adoration, exchanging light banter. Finally, as the hour grew late. Jay insisted on helping clean up, but Ian waved him off.
"Leave it. It can wait until tomorrow."
Jay called a taxi, and when Ian offered to escort him home, Jay laughed. "I'm nowhere near that intoxicated. Besides, it's Christmas—you should be relaxing."
At the door, Jay turned back. "I had the most wonderful time. Thank you for everything."
"Thank you for coming," Ian replied quietly.
They stood at the door for a moment, neither quite ready to end the day.
After Jay finally left, Ian stood alone in his apartment, still wrapped in the warm afterglow of Jay's company. He normally reserved smoking for dire situations, but today was special. He stepped outside for a cigarette, using Jay's lighter and reading the engraved message. 
"You've got this."
He smiled to himself. Did he really? At least his lovely assistant seemed to have complete faith in his capabilities.
Jay had looked radiant that day—carefree and happy—and Ian treasured every moment. But Jay had also looked more attractive than ever, and there had been moments when it was difficult to stop himself from reaching out to touch him. He never would, but the urge had been overwhelming.
He wanted Jay to only ever look at him with those trusting, adoring eyes. He remembered that morning weeks ago when Jay had woken hungover and frightened, backing against the wall in confusion. Ian never wanted to see fear in Jay's eyes again—especially not when Jay looked at him.
Scene 3
After Christmas
Jay spent the rest of Christmas resting, occasionally replaying moments from the day in his mind. The memory of Ian's apartment, the tree they had decorated together, their conversations, all felt precious and worth preserving. But soon enough, the holiday ended and it was time to return to work.
The office would be mostly empty during the holiday period, which meant long days with Ian in the warmly illuminated space. Jay remembered last year's Christmas period with fondness. The shared meals, the late hours that never felt burdensome. He was looking forward to it again.
Jay reached the office early, finding the reception area dark. He made coffee in the empty kitchen and sat at his desk, watching the city wake through the windows.
Ian arrived twenty minutes later. "You're early."
"I couldn't sleep. Too much excitement about spreadsheets."
"Naturally. Nothing says post-Christmas enthusiasm like financial reports."
Ian disappeared into his office. Through the open door, Jay heard him arranging papers. The sounds of their shared workspace surrounded him like a comfortable blanket.
Luc arrived at nine, dramatically throwing himself across Jay's desk. "I'm dying. Why do we have to work between Christmas and New Year?"
"We're an abnormal company run by sadists," Jay responded solemnly.
Luc collapsed dramatically into his chair. "Jay, you look suspiciously cheerful. It's unnatural."
"I like the quiet period. Nobody calling, no urgent meetings. Just us and the numbers."
"You're broken. Fundamentally broken as a person."
Zoe arrived next, more composed but equally unenthusiastic. "I forgot how empty the building gets. The security guard looked surprised to see me."
"At least nobody got sick this year. Remember last year when Ela had the flu? We were down to three people," Jay said.
"Small mercies," Luc muttered.
They got to work, but the atmosphere was relaxed. With most clients on holiday and no pressing deadlines, they could take their time. By noon, Jay's stomach was growling.
"Should we order something?" Luc asked.
"Yeah, we could eat here, like last year. Save time, stay focused."
"Agreed. I'm not putting on a coat to freeze outside when there's a perfectly good kitchen right here."
When the food arrived, they migrated to the kitchen area, a space that was Ian's private domain during lunch hours while the rest of the team went to restaurants. Ian was already there, preparing his standard balanced meal.
They ate together at the large kitchen table, Luc starting an animated discussion about New Year's resolutions, declaring he would learn the saxophone, to everyone's horror.
"Your neighbours will murder you," Zoe said.
"They already hate me. Might as well give them a real reason."
"What about you, Jay? Any resolutions?" Zoe asked.
"Find a proper apartment, maybe."
"I thought that agent found you something perfect. Just take it. The location is great, the price is reasonable, and you need the space."
"But it's so small. You'll be able to afford something three times that size soon," Luc protested.
"I don't need three times the size."
"You don't know what you need until you have it. Trust me, once you experience proper standards, you can't go back."
Zoe rolled her eyes. "Not everyone needs a penthouse, Luc."
"But everyone deserves one."
"It's the perfect size for one person. Clever storage, good layout. I don't need massive amounts of space," Jay argued.
"You will when you get promoted. Which is inevitable. Then you'll want a proper place for entertaining, maybe a home office," Luc countered.
"I'm not getting promoted. I'm an assistant."
"For now."
Ian had been silent during this exchange, but Jay noticed his expression growing increasingly tense.
After lunch, they returned to work. The afternoon stretched long but productive. At five o'clock, Zoe saved her files and got up.
"I'm heading out. See you tomorrow."
"Same. Don't work too late, you two," Luc said, already packing his bag. 
Jay waved them off, and suddenly the office was much quieter. He glanced toward Ian's office and returned to his own tasks. An hour later, Ian appeared at his desk.
"Caffeine break?"
"Definitely."
They reconvened in the kitchen and talked for an hour, maybe more, about music, hobbies, cultural differences between regions. Sports they'd played as children.
"I have a fashion question," Jay said eventually.
"Go ahead."
"How do you always look so put together? I'm trying, but I still feel like I'm playing dress-up half the time."
"My tailor does all the work. I just listen to him. I very rarely wear anything other than a suit, so it's not difficult."
"You make it sound simple."
"It is simple. Find someone competent, trust their judgement, and don't overthink it."
"Do you ever wear jeans?"
"I own one pair. They're ten years old and I've worn them twice."
"Now I'm trying to picture you in jeans and my brain is refusing to cooperate."
They returned to work and the evening wore on. Eventually, Jay checked his watch and was startled to find it was nearly nine.
"We should probably call it a day," he said reluctantly.
"Probably."
But neither of them moved immediately. The office was conducive to the same intimacy Jay remembered from last year, that sense of existing in a bubble separate from the rest of the world. He no longer had any reservations when talking to Ian. The glass wall that had felt so solid just months ago seemed to have dissolved entirely.
The next day, Jay decided to enhance their lunch situation. He stopped at the bakery he'd discovered last year. He purchased an assortment of salads, sandwiches, and pastries, charging everything to the company card.
When he unpacked the bags onto the kitchen counter, Luc's eyes widened. "Did you rob a restaurant?"
"Christmas work requires morale boosters. Consider it compensation for skeleton crew duty."
"I'm not arguing. This looks amazing."
They ate well that day and every day after. Jay made the bakery run part of his mornings, ensuring they had variety and quality. The four of them gathered in the kitchen for lunch like clockwork. Even Ian supplemented his meal with the red cabbage salad, which came with pomegranate seeds and roasted vegetables.
The following days followed the same pattern. Work in the morning, lunch in the kitchen, more work in the afternoon, then long evening hours alone with Ian. Luc and Zoe always left at five, claiming they had lives outside the office, though Luc admitted his life currently consisted of watching cooking shows and annoying his flatmates. The building felt vast and empty, but the Christmas lights turned the space into something intimate.
Jay and Ian would drift to the lounge area around six, ostensibly taking a break but really just wanting each other's company. Jay would sprawl on the couch while Ian leaned against the wall, pastry in hand, looking more relaxed than he ever did during regular hours. The office trees twinkled around them, and the city lights glowed through the windows.
"Your diet is suffering," Jay observed.
"It's the holiday season. I'm not an ascetic monk."
"Could've fooled me. You're very disciplined."
"There are exceptions."
Jay sighed deeply. "I'm still thinking about the apartment. Zoe thinks I should go for it. The offer is great, it fits my needs, why hesitate? But Luc is against it. He says the flat is too small and not glamorous enough. Plus, given my career trajectory, I'll soon be able to afford something much more ambitious."
"Luc has expensive taste."
"He does. But he's not wrong, is he?"
"Luc is projecting his own preferences onto you. The question is whether the apartment suits your life, not whether it impresses other people."
"You're right. I think I'm just scared of making the wrong choice."
"There's no wrong choice. You can always move again if circumstances change."
Jay felt some of the tension ease, even if he still wasn't entirely convinced. "That's true. Thanks."
On New Year's Eve, they worked until three o'clock. The office felt peaceful, as though the city itself was holding its breath before the celebration began. Ian emerged from his office and surveyed the nearly empty floor.
"I'm officially declaring the workday complete. Everyone to my office, please."
They gathered in his space, where Ian produced a bottle of excellent whiskey and four glasses.
"This is new," Zoe said.
"It's not new," Luc corrected. "He did this last year with just Jay and me."
"It wasn't a custom before that. Is this going to be a tradition now?"
"Perhaps," Ian said, pouring. "It seems appropriate."
He handed glasses around, and they stood in a small circle. The late afternoon light slanted through the windows, turning everything golden.
"To a successful year," Ian said, raising his glass. "And to the year ahead. May it bring continued growth and prosperity for Turner & Associates, and for all of you personally."
They drank. Jay immediately winced, the whiskey burning his throat.
"Still can't handle it?" Luc laughed.
"It tastes like liquid fire."
Jay remembered this moment from last year—how formal it had felt, how he'd been uncertain about everything. This year he felt only gratitude. Ian shook hands with each of them in turn, a firm grip and direct eye contact. When he reached Jay, the handshake lasted longer than the others.
"Thank you for everything this year. You've made it far better than it would have been otherwise."
Jay felt his throat tighten slightly. "Thank you for the same."
After the others left, Jay watched Ian return to his desk.
"You're staying?"
"Just one more hour."
Jay wanted to protest, to drag Ian away from his computer and force him to celebrate, but he knew better. Instead, he said, "Happy New Year, Ian. Have a good evening. Don't work too late."
Jay returned home to his apartment, made himself dinner, and tried to focus on his textbooks. But he couldn't concentrate, his mind drifting back to the office, to Ian alone at his desk while the rest of the city celebrated.
At midnight, he set down the book and went to his window. The city erupted in light and sound, fireworks blooming against the dark sky. He pulled out his phone and typed out a message.
"Happy New Year. Thank you for making this year extraordinary. Here's to whatever comes next."
He sent it before he could overthink it, and barely a minute passed before his phone chimed.
"Happy New Year, Jay. I'm looking forward to the year ahead."
He smiled to himself, watching the fireworks continue. The new year was starting perfectly. Now he just had to survive the quarterly reports and the gala.
Scene 4
The annual storm
The entire team returned to the office after New Year, and the grumbling started immediately.
"I can't believe we're doing this again. Other companies ease back into work. We dive straight into hell," Ela said, dropping into her chair with theatrical despair.
"Annual reporting waits for no one," Amy replied, though she looked equally resigned.
Jay barely heard them. Ian's inbox had exploded overnight—clients suddenly remembering urgent matters, international markets reopening, everything demanding immediate attention. He catalogued messages, prioritizing by urgency, when Ian's annual email popped up.
Jay skimmed it—congratulations on exceptional performance, record-breaking returns, gratitude for dedication. His eyes caught on "bonus distributions" but he filed it away to read properly later. Right now, eleven urgent emails needed forwarding.
Soon after, his phone buzzed with a bank notification. Jay glanced at it absently, then froze. The number looked wrong.
He checked again. The deposit was real, sitting in his account. Last year's bonus had seemed generous for his few months of work. This was... this was more than double his entire previous year's income.
He stared at the screen, trying to process what this meant for his life, but Luc appeared at his desk with an urgent question and the moment was lost. The whirlwind of duties swallowed him once again.
Despite all their preparations, things went wrong. Deadlines were ruthless. Each day became a battle against time itself. Those slow, intimate hours with Ian disappeared completely.
By the fourth day, formal dress codes collapsed. Kim showed up in sweatpants. Amy wore the same oversized sweater three days running. Someone brought in sleeping bags. Zoe worked from a nest of blankets in the corner of the conference room. Even Ela abandoned her blazers for comfortable cardigans. Only Ian maintained his suits, though Jay noticed the ties disappearing by evening.
"I hate January. I hate reporting. I hate numbers," Luc groaned, sprawled across his desk.
Sunday night, deep into the second week, the office resembled a refugee camp. Ela sat in the corner, actually crying over spreadsheets that refused to reconcile despite hours of searching. Max had given up all pretense and was lying on the lounge sofa, staring at the ceiling.
Jay glanced at the clock. Nearly eleven. His eyes burned from staring at spreadsheets and his back ached from sitting too long in the same position.
He got up, stretched, then made his way to the kitchen. Through the glass, Jay could see Ian hunched over his desk, face taut, eyes red from strain.
Jay made coffee. He rarely prepared beverages for Ian, but Ian looked like he needed it. He brought the mug to Ian's office and entered without knocking.
Ian looked up, startled.
"Caffeine. You look like you're about to die at your desk," Jay said, setting it down.
"Thank you." Ian's voice was rough. He wrapped his hands around the mug but didn't drink. 
"I'm breaking my team. Look at them. Ela is crying. Max has achieved horizontal surrender. Hardly a glowing testimonial for my leadership."
"You're not breaking anyone. We're stressed, but we're managing. We'll get through this."
"I know. I just wish it didn't require destroying everyone in the process."
Jay was quiet for a moment, then said, "We should do something fun once this is over. Like we did back in autumn."
Ian visibly perked up at that. "Really?"
"Though this time you should think of things you actually like. I picked last time."
Ian pulled up his calendar, scrolling through the maze of appointments. "The weekend after the gala. That's the only opening in January."
"Then it's a promise."
"I'll hold you to it."
They returned to work feeling slightly more hopeful about the future.
When the reporting period finally released its death grip, everyone stumbled out of the office like survivors of a natural disaster. Jay hadn't been to the gym once since New Year's. His eating schedule was destroyed. His sleep pattern was nonexistent.
But each time his spirits faltered, he looked at his bank balance. The number still seemed unreal. He was loaded. That was such a weird feeling.
Then he looked at his calendar, where the night out with Ian was circled in red. Life wasn't so bad after all.
The gala loomed. Jay made appointments to get his hair done and purchase a proper shirt for his cufflinks. The preparations were less fraught with anxiety than last year. He knew what to expect now.
The night arrived too quickly. Jay adjusted his bow tie for the fifth time, watching himself in the mirror. Same tuxedo as last year, but the new shirt, the sapphire cufflinks, his watch—he looked the part even if he didn't feel it.
Nervousness crept through him as he remembered last year's incident. He made a mental list of rules: don't drink, avoid crowds, hide behind more senior team members whenever possible.
The venue was a ballroom in the most upscale district of the city. Photographers clustered at the entrance where limousines deposited distinguished guests onto red carpet. Jay's taxi dropped him a street away. He slipped past the cameras, attaching himself to a group from accounting.
Once inside, he immediately located what he imagined was a hidden corner and stationed himself there with a glass of sparkling water. It took less than five minutes for Ian to find him.
"Jay. Are you alright?" Ian looked worse than Jay had ever seen him, despite his immaculate attire. His face was drawn, eyes shadowed.
"I'm fine. Just trying to stay out of the way."
"That's probably wise. I wanted to check on you, but I can't stay long. I have to circulate." Ian glanced around the room, and Jay noticed something odd in his expression. Not just stress—something closer to fear.
"I understand. I'll be fine."
"Find me if you need anything. Anything at all."
"I will."
Ian disappeared into the crowd, and Jay watched him go with concern. Something was definitely wrong.
Jay drifted between Max, Amy, and Luc as the evening progressed, trying never to be alone. He held the same glass of sparkling water for over an hour, tense as if he were on a battlefield. Across the room, Ian played his role perfectly, but Jay could see the strain. Something had rattled him badly. 
Max told lengthy stories about his children. Luc flirted outrageously with someone from legal. Jay smiled and nodded and watched the clock. The conversations around him blurred into background noise.
Ian, meanwhile, was drowning in dread. He had woken that morning from a nightmare so realistic he'd believed it was real for several terrifying moments. The very same gala, marble floors and distinguished crowds, and at eleven o'clock a man had approached with a knife. Ian had been the target, but Jay had thrown himself in the way. Ian had watched Jay bleed out on the floor in his arms, unable to stop it, unable to do anything but hold him.
He'd woken drenched in cold sweat at four in the morning and hadn't been able to shake the images since.
And to make matters worse, a client situation had emerged that morning. An urgent meeting scheduled for next week, impossible to delegate or reschedule. He'd have to cancel his plans with Jay. After everything they'd been through these past weeks, after finally having something to look forward to, it was being taken away.
He was unsettled, annoyed, disappointed, and couldn't hide it no matter how hard he tried.
At ten forty-five, Ian found Jay on the balcony, standing alone and looking out over the city.
"Do you want to leave?" Ian asked.
Jay turned, surprised. "I'm fine. Are you alright?"
"No. I need to get out of here. I could use a pretext to exit."
Something in Ian's tone made Jay agree immediately. "Of course."
They slipped out through a back entrance where Ian's driver waited. Once in the car, Jay tried to understand what was happening.
"What's wrong? Did something happen?"
Ian was silent for a long moment, watching the city pass outside the window. He couldn't tell Jay about the nightmare. "Client emergency. I have to fly out Thursday evening. Our plans for the weekend—I have to cancel."
Jay's face fell. "Oh."
"After everything we just went through. After working ourselves half to death for two weeks straight. More work ahead. It's never enough."
"It's alright. We can reschedule."
"It's not alright. Nothing about this is alright."
Jay didn't know what to say to that. Ian was right—it wasn't fair. But fairness rarely factored into their work.
When they arrived at Jay's building, Jay said impulsively, "Want to come up? It's probably the last time I'll host you in the old apartment."
Ian looked at him, something complicated passing across his face, then nodded.
Jay's studio was exactly as Ian remembered—small, cramped, but meticulously organized. Jay retrieved the bottle of hard liquor from the Christmas basket and poured generous measures into two mismatched glasses.
Ian examined the label. "It's acceptable."
They sat on Jay's narrow couch and drank. Jay grimaced at his first sip while Ian drank his like water, consuming most of the bottle, needing the burn to push away the nightmare images. Their conversation consisted mainly of grumbling about the unfairness of the world, the relentlessness of their work, the impossibility of ever having time for themselves.
"I thought once I achieved success, things would get easier. What a stupid assumption that was," Ian said.
"Success just means different problems."
"Bigger problems. More expensive problems."
"Problems that bleed into every hour of every day."
"Exactly."
Ian felt the alcohol softening his anxiety, though he couldn't stop glancing at his watch. Midnight. In his dream, Jay had been dead for an hour now. But Jay was here, alive, slightly flushed from whiskey. Safe.
Eventually the bottle was empty and the hour was late. Ian stood unsteadily, and Jay helped him to the door.
"Thank you for tonight. I needed this," Ian said.
"Anytime."
Ian looked at Jay one last time in the dim light of the hallway. The words slipped out before he could stop them. 
"You looked beautiful tonight."
He caught himself immediately, clenching his jaw. That was too much, too revealing. He'd made it weird. 
"I should go."
He left quickly, not waiting for a response, and spent the ride home chastising himself for his stupidity.
Jay stood alone in his doorway, blushing furiously. His heart beat rapidly in his chest, his mind replaying those words over and over.
He tried to be rational about it. Ian was exhausted, stressed, drunk. The words meant nothing.
But he went to bed still thinking about it, unable to make sense of his own reaction, unwilling to examine why the compliment had affected him so deeply.
Scene 5
Moving forward
After the gala, the atmosphere at work was too depleted for proper gossip. Everyone moved slowly and spoke quietly, and conversations were minimal and mostly work-related.
"This year is much worse than last. Or am I imagining things?" Amy said during one brief break.
"You're not imagining anything. January last year was brutal, but at least we had some energy left. This year we're starting from empty," Max confirmed. 
Even the gossip about Ian's early departure was less animated, despite this happening the second year in a row. A few people mentioned it in passing, speculating that he'd developed a particular distaste for these events, or perhaps the exhaustion had finally caught up with him.
Ela asked Jay about it directly. "You left early too, right? What happened?"
"I left before midnight. Nothing dramatic," Jay said, which was technically true. 
"Ian looked terrible all evening. Was he sick?"
"Just tired, I think. Like all of us."
No one on the team had energy left to spare for investigation. The topic died quickly, replaced by more immediate concerns about deadlines and deliverables.
With the beginning of the year historically being the busiest period, moods were generally poor. Jay didn't see any enthusiasm about the annual bonuses, which was proof enough of how stretched thin everyone was. People mentioned the amounts with wan gratitude but no real excitement.
"It's generous. I'm overjoyed. But mostly I just want to sleep for three days straight," Luc said flatly.
"Same," Kim agreed.
Jay decided to start getting his affairs in order despite the exhaustion. He returned to the gym on Tuesday evening, and Rus pretended not to recognize him.
"Excuse me, sir, but I think you have the wrong building. The corporate offices are down the street."
Jay smiled wearily. "Very funny."
"I was starting to think you'd died. Or moved to another country."
"Work has been insane."
"So I gathered. You look exhausted."
"I am exhausted. And I have news. I decided to buy the apartment after all. I'll probably move within a couple of months."
Rus's face fell. "Really? That's... well, that's great for you. But I'm going to miss having you around."
"We can still hang out. It's not like I'm leaving the city."
"Promise?"
"Promise. You're not getting rid of me that easily."
They worked out together, and Rus kept the conversation light, avoiding anything that required serious thought. Jay appreciated it.
Afterwards, Jay went to Café Lemon to deliver the same news to Fay. Her face lit up when he entered.
"Look who finally remembered we exist!"
"I've been buried in work. I wanted to tell you that I'm taking your advice. I'm buying the apartment."
Fay's expression turned triumphant. "I knew you would! That's wonderful news."
"It won't happen for a few months, but I wanted you to know since you encouraged me to go for it."
"You'll still visit though, right? Even when you're living in the posh district?"
"Of course. There's no café as nice as this one, even in the posh district."
"Damn right there isn't. I'm proud of you, you know. You've come a long way."
The next day at work, Jay called the agent during a brief lull. "I'd like to schedule another viewing. I'm pretty much decided, but I want to see it one more time."
The agent was overjoyed. "That's excellent news! When would work for you?"
"I'm very busy at the moment, but sometime in the next two weeks?"
"Absolutely. I'll be in touch to confirm a time."
Jay hung up feeling both excited and terrified. This was really happening.
The remainder of the week passed quickly. The long hours were too strained to properly appreciate. Ian was tense, and Jay was equally unhappy. Their planned day out was supposed to happen this weekend, but instead Ian left early Thursday to catch a flight for the client meeting, looking miserable about it.
Friday marked the first day Jay had ever worked without Ian in the office beside him. It felt oddly forlorn. Ian's dark office looked ominous through the glass wall. The Christmas trees were already gone, and the heavy gray skies visible through the windows made Jay feel like he was attending a wake.
He tried to shake the solemn mood and sent Ian a text. "Office is weird without you. Kim is being productive. Deeply unnatural."
Ian was already in the meeting when his phone buzzed. He glanced at it discreetly and felt his mood lift. Not much, but enough to make the presentations slightly more bearable.
This wasn't how he'd wanted to spend the weekend. He'd half-wanted taking Jay with him, he was his assistant, after all, but decided against it. He remembered how heavily Jay had handled the jet lag last time, and Jay was already exhausted. Ian didn't want to make things worse. At least Jay would get some rest, even if Ian himself couldn't.
Jay spent the weekend on the gym, rest, and cleaning. He purchased moving boxes and began cataloguing his belongings. The process was simultaneously exciting and depressing. Books, clothes, kitchen supplies, everything went into lists and categories.
He'd already called the agent with the good news. Now he just needed to contact the bank. Ian had made arrangements for him to meet with a clerk at a bank Jay had never used and never even heard of, but since Ian recommended it, surely there was nothing to fear.
The next week, Ian returned but remained in a foul mood. It was the last week of January, and they were slowly beginning preparations for the busiest time of the year. The beginning of the year always consisted of refreshing the strategy, which was a major production.
Last year Jay only knew the period was busy. Now he had a clearer understanding of what was happening, exactly, and he didn't look forward to it. Neither did anyone else.
"Here we go again. Strategy refresh. My favourite time of year," Luc said mournfully during lunch.
"At least we know what to expect," Max offered.
"That makes it worse."
"Much worse. Strategy requires actual thinking."
"And endless meetings. So many meetings," Amy added.
"And revisions. Draft after draft after draft" Max said. 
The mere word "strategy" sounded like a curse to everyone.
The long hours continued, draining and full of arduous assignments. But Jay still found an afternoon off to meet with the bank representative. Ian had arranged the appointment, providing contact information and a brief introduction.
The bank was in a part of the city Jay rarely visited. The representative greeted him and led him to a private office.
The mortgage terms were surreal. Two percent interest over thirty years. No penalties for early repayment. Flexible terms if his circumstances changed. Jay had researched enough to know this was impossibly favourable.
"This is... very generous," Jay said cautiously.
"Mr. Hagen vouched for you personally. That carries weight with our institution."
There it was again. Ian's name opening doors, smoothing paths. Jay wasn't sure how he felt about it anymore. He was uncomfortably aware of how much influence Ian wielded on his behalf. It felt like being cared for. Protected.
"I'll need some time to review the paperwork."
"Of course. Take all the time you need. When you're ready to proceed, just contact me directly."
Jay returned home with the preliminary paperwork, reading through every page twice. The terms were exactly as described, almost too good to be true. But he was becoming more comfortable with the fact that Ian's name apparently held more weight than Jay had imagined.
He ended the month with a heavy heart. Everything—well, almost everything—was going as planned. But such major decisions still made him anxious. He probably wouldn't move until at least April, maybe May, even if everything went well. He simply had no bandwidth left for the arrangements.
For now, January was ending, and the continued demands of the first quarter lay ahead. Strategy season loomed like a dark cloud on the horizon. He'd have to grit his teeth and endure.
At least he had the memories. The ferry ride and autumn gardens. Christmas in Ian's apartment, decorating the tree together, Ian in that cream sweater looking softer than Jay had imagined possible. The late evenings in the office kitchen, Ian leaning against the wall, talking about nothing and everything.
He clung to those moments as February approached, promising himself that eventually, things would ease. He just had to survive until then.
