Chapter 25: Tropical heat
Scene 1
Reset
The morning light streamed across the room, and Jay realized from its brightness that he’d slept too long. His phone confirmed it was past ten in the morning. The jetlag had hit harder than expected, leaving him feeling disoriented and heavy-limbed. He lay still for a moment, letting his mind catch up with the reality that he was back in his small studio that suddenly felt impossibly cramped after the spacious hotel suite.
The chill in the air when he opened his window made it clear that autumn was approaching fast. Quarterly reports will start in October, and with them, the chaos that consumed everyone's lives for at least a week. He needed to get his affairs in order before work swallowed him whole again.
A proper breakfast seemed like the right place to start. He dressed in his favorite jeans and one of his two remaining t-shirts, then walked to the café down the street. The warmth of the place and the hearty breakfast of eggs, toast, and strong coffee helped clear the fog from his mind. By the time he returned home, he felt ready to tackle the mountain of unpacking that awaited him.
His own suitcase, which he had bought just months ago and considered quite nice at the time, looked shabby next to the two pristine pieces that had accompanied him home, courtesy of Ian and Leo. Both were top-of-the-line, and Jay ran his fingers over the smooth leather with appreciation.
He started with the gifts, complete with complimentary presentation boxes. Ian had insisted on the expensive options, brushing aside Jay's protests with a firm "Leo's paying" whenever Jay had tried to suggest something more reasonable. Jay prepared everything for shipping to his siblings, already dreading their reactions to such lavish presents.
They had also purchased souvenirs for their team members, which Jay thought was a thoughtful gesture.
Afterwards Jay turned to his clothes. The process was both revelatory and depressing. His casual wardrobe had already been decimated. There was nothing left to donate. He was down to one pair of jeans, one pair of sweatpants, and two t-shirts for casual wear, not counting his gym clothes. He didn't even own hoodies anymore. Everything else had been gradually replaced by an ever-growing collection of formal attire.
Ten suits now hung in his closet. The new three-piece sets from the upscale tailor commanded the center position, flanked by lighter summer suits, event wear, and the pieces he had accumulated over the winter. A tuxedo hung at one end, and two designer outfits that no longer seemed quite so outlandish completed the formal section. The resort wear, shirts, shoes, and ties that couldn't fit in the closet were relegated to the suitcases, which now formed an awkward tower in the center of his living room. His casual clothes perched precariously on top, making the whole arrangement look like some bizarre fashion installation.
His studio had transformed into what looked like a high-end clothing warehouse. Jay stood in the middle of it all, hands on his hips, surveying the space with dismay. This wasn't how normal people lived.
The afternoon trip to the post office provided a welcome break from the domestic chaos. The postal worker raised an eyebrow at the declared value of the packages, but Jay just smiled and paid the insurance fees. Once the gifts were safely dispatched, he sent Ema a photo from the hotel room with a simple message: "Trip was great. Expect deliveries promptly."
His phone rang within minutes.
"Jay! This place looks incredible! Tell me everything. Did you really stay somewhere this fancy? What was the food like? Did you meet anyone interesting? And what did you send us?"
Jay smiled as he walked home. He kept the details light, focusing on the sights and the food. By the time they hung up, some of his own confusion had subsided.
That evening, he cooked dinner for the entire week, portioning everything into containers, and prepared his clothes and equipment for work. 
The new laptop sat on his table next to his old one, the contrast almost cruel. His college computer, which had served him faithfully for years and required countless hours of part-time work to afford, now looked like something salvaged from a scrapyard. The sleek new machine was undoubtedly superior in every way, but Jay couldn't bring himself to use it. It represented something he resented—a bribe to placate Ian after Jay had been treated like a prostitute. A gesture to smooth over the humiliation he had endured.
But then Ian's words echoed in his memory. The harasser was the one who had behaved badly, and it had no bearing on Jay as a person. Ian had protected him, would continue to protect him. With Ian around, he didn't need to fear anyone trying to take advantage of him.
It was a good thought, one that helped quiet the more troubling feelings the gift evoked.
He arrived at work at seven-thirty Tuesday morning to find Ian already in the office. They exchanged their typical morning greetings, and Jay felt emboldened by their shared experience. After dropping his things and powering up his computer, Jay walked into Ian's office for a chat.
"How's the jetlag treating you?" Jay asked.
"Better than expected. I managed a decent night's sleep. What about you? You look much more alert than you did at the airport. I was worried you might struggle more with the adjustment."  
"Still feeling a bit off-schedule, but nothing coffee can't handle. When did you get in this morning?"  
"Six-thirty. Did you manage to get everything sorted at home?"
"Eventually. Though my apartment now looks like a clothing warehouse exploded in it. I had to stack suitcases in the middle of my living room just to fit everything."
"Is the space becoming a problem? We could look into storage solutions, or perhaps it's time to consider a larger apartment."
The comment was casual, but Ian's tone made Jay look at him more closely. There was a relaxation in his posture that hadn't been there in weeks, an ease that reminded Jay of their late-night conversations before everything had become complicated.
"I'm not sure I'm ready for that yet. It's just... a lot to adjust to." Jay paused, choosing his words carefully. "The whole trip was... eye-opening. I learned a lot."
"It was good to get away from the office. Sometimes perspective requires a change of scenery."
Both seeming to recognize that they were talking around something larger. Jay felt the weight of all the things he couldn't say: how the walls they had both built seemed suddenly unnecessary.
"You handled yourself admirably. I hope it wasn't too overwhelming."
"It wasn't. And thank you. For everything. For protecting me."
As he returned to his desk, Jay realized that his understanding of what he wanted changed. Jay wanted to be closer to Ian. Maybe not a friend—he was still a subordinate, after all—but something more than just an employee. Ian had become someone he could rely on, someone who had proven himself worthy of trust. And Jay wanted to be the same for him.
An anchor. Someone solid and dependable in a world that had shown Ian too little kindness.
The community Ian was born into had rejected him despite his obvious worth, despite him being a victim of a scheme. The injustice was unthinkable, but perhaps Ian was right about there being no separate worlds—just people who were small and petty regardless of their status.
Scene 2
Souvenirs
Jay began sorting through the backlog that had accumulated despite his efforts to stay on top of emails during the trip. Several tasks had fallen behind schedule, and with the month drawing to a close, he wanted everything sorted before October's chaos descended upon them.
His colleagues gradually came into the office, each asking about his trip. Jay waited until everyone was in place before making his rounds with the souvenirs. He had prepared a diverse collection: local confectionery, special edition hot sauces, designer bracelets, leather key-chains, and various other small treasures that captured the essence of their destination.
"Alright everyone, gather round. We brought back a few things," Jay announced, producing the first bag of gifts. 
The vintage band t-shirts were an immediate hit with Luc and Kim. They rifled through, attempting to claim the most coveted pieces.
"No way," Kim said, holding up a faded tour shirt. "Where did you even find this?"
"The hotel concierge recommended a vintage shop," Jay explained. 
"This one's mine. Absolutely no negotiation," Kim declared.
"You can have that one if I get this," Luc countered, clutching a shirt from a band Jay had never heard of but that apparently held cultural weight.
"You two are pathetic," Amy joked.
Jay was relieved to see that Luc looked better than he had before the trip. The hollow look around his eyes had faded, and his energy was returning. Still, Jay had prepared something special for him.
"Luc, this one's for you. It's supposed to be comforting, made with warm spices. Thought you might appreciate it," Jay said, producing a large block of chocolate.
Luc accepted the gift with exaggerated solemnity, then broke into a grin. "Are you trying to tell me I need comfort chocolate? Because that's both insulting and completely accurate."
"Just thought you might enjoy it."
"Well, since you put actual thought into this, I suppose I can forgive the implication that I'm emotionally fragile."
"You know what? After the quarterly reports are done and we're all human again, we should do something fun. Something completely different," Jay suddenly said.
"That sounds great. What did you have in mind?"
"I don't know yet, but something adventurous. Or at least more interesting than post-crisis drinks." 
Luc tilted his head, watching Jay with suspicion. "Wait a minute. Did someone switch you out for a different person during this trip? Because the Jay who left here would never suggest doing something different and fun without at least three layers of anxiety about it."
"Maybe I just learned a few things while I was away."
"Clearly. I approve of this upgraded version."
Once the gifts were distributed, the team naturally gathered around Jay's desk, eager for details about the trip. He kept his stories light and focused on the cultural aspects: the impressive hotels, the restaurants, the general atmosphere of the destination.
"The negotiations were about as boring as you'd expect. Standard corporate meetings, nothing worth mentioning. But the restaurant where we had dinner was incredible. Completely different vibe from anywhere here. You know how the Palladium feels all stately and old-world? This place was the opposite. Ultra-modern, cosmopolitan. Made me feel like I was in a movie."
He avoided any mention of the disastrous incident. That part of the trip still felt too complicated to share as casual office anecdotes.
The storytelling session gradually dissolved as everyone returned to their own work, and Jay threw himself back into his tasks. He worked through the afternoon, clearing his backlog and organizing priorities for the coming days.
At five o'clock sharp, he began shutting down his computer and gathering his things.
"Heading out?" Ian asked, appearing at his desk.
"Gym day. Already missed Saturday, and Rus is definitely going to make me pay for it. He's going to push me twice as hard to make up for the missed session."
Ian's face showed the faintest hint of amusement. "It'll be worth it. Better to face the punishment now than let it compound."
"Easy for you to say. You're not the one who's going to be doing extra sets." Jay headed for the elevator, calling back over his shoulder. "See you tomorrow."
Ian watched him go, his composed expression slipping the moment Jay disappeared around the corner. Four days together had been like a glimpse of paradise, and now having to let him walk away each evening felt like a particular form of punishment. The shared meals, the conversations that lasted late into the night, all of it had felt natural, right, like something he could build a life around.
The quarterly reports couldn't come soon enough. A week of consistent overtime meant he would get to see Jay from dawn to dusk, a prospect that filled him with anticipation even as he recognized how pathetic that made him. He forced himself to focus on his work, but thoughts of Jay persisted, threading through every task like a constant undercurrent.
At the gym, Jay presented Rus with his own gift: a t-shirt and baseball cap from an iconic athletic brand, both featuring designs that weren't available locally.
"Just a small thank you. For taking such good care of me all these months."
Rus looked touched, which made the gesture feel completely justified. "This is really thoughtful of you. I appreciate it."
"I'm glad you like them."
"Of course, you realize this changes nothing about tonight's workout. In fact, since you clearly think you can bribe me into going easy on you, I'm going to have to double your routine. Can't have you thinking gifts will get you special treatment."
"I was afraid you'd say that."
The workout was indeed brutal, but Jay met it with energy he hadn't expected. He joked with Rus between sets, feeling more relaxed than he had in weeks. There was something liberating about returning to his own spaces after the trip.
"You seem different tonight," Rus observed as Jay finished a particularly challenging set. "More energized. Things better at work?"
"Yeah, for the time being. Though that's about to change. We're heading into quarterly report season, which means I won't be able to come to the gym for at least a week."
Rus shook his head with mock disapproval. "The gym should be an obvious priority. I don't care how busy work gets, you need to maintain your routine."
"Tell that to my boss when I'm working fourteen-hour days."
"I will if I have to. Health comes first, career comes second. That's not negotiable."
Jay laughed, appreciating both the concern and the absurdity of imagining Rus lecturing Ian about workout schedules. "I'll do my best to sneak in a session or two if I can."
"See that you do. I don't want to have to start over from scratch when you come back."
On his way home, Jay made one final stop at Café Lemon. Fay was behind the counter, and her face lit up when she saw him approaching with a small bag.
"Jay! How was your trip?"
"Incredible. I brought you something. Just a small thank you for all the great coffee over the years."
Fay opened the bag to reveal an assortment of artisanal chocolates. "Oh my goodness, these look amazing! You didn't have to do this."
"I wanted to. You've been making my days better for a long time now."
"Well, in that case, let me make your evening better too. What can I get you?"
"Hot chocolate. It's getting chilly, and coffee this late would keep me up all night."
As Fay prepared his drink, they chatted about the changing weather and the melancholy that seemed to hang over the city as autumn approached.
"The days are getting shorter. Always makes everything feel more contemplative," Fay mused.
"I don't mind it as much as I used to," Jay admitted.
"There's something nice about this time of year. Everything slowing down, getting cosy. Makes you appreciate the simple things."
"I know what you mean. After a weekend of fancy restaurants, there's something perfect about just... this."
"Sounds like you had quite an adventure."
"I did. But it's good to be home."
Jay walked home feeling happy. It had been a good day. Most of his post-trip plans were complete, and tomorrow he could focus entirely on work. He felt ready for the challenges ahead.
Perhaps he should have been exhausted after such an intense week, but he wasn't. He felt motivated and notably less tense. The business trip had reset his perspective on his work, his relationships, and his place in the world around him.
As he prepared dinner in his crowded apartment, surrounded by suitcases that served as a tangible reminder of how much his life had changed, Jay looked forward to tomorrow.
Scene 3
The grind
The quarterly reports came like a plague, turning the normally pleasant workspace into a pressure cooker of frayed nerves. Jay had hoped that experience would make this round easier, but if anything, it felt worse than before. The workload was relentless, the atmosphere tense, and everyone seemed to be operating on a hair trigger. The quarterly bonus notification that appeared on his phone might as well have been spam for all the attention he paid it. Everything outside the immediate demands of work faded into irrelevance.
Minor mistakes that would normally warrant a gentle correction now provoked sharp responses. Files that couldn't be located immediately became sources of panic. Jay was walking on eggshells, triple-checking everything and speaking in measured tones to avoid adding to the stress.
"Where's the Hartwell compliance folder?" Amy's called across the office.
Jay looked up from his screen where he was formatting the third revision of the Mayfield summary. "Client documentation server, compliance subfolder, dated last Thursday."
"I already checked there."
Jay saved his work and walked over to Amy's desk. He pulled up the network directory and searched through the folders. "Here. You were in the wrong quarterly folder."
"Thanks. Jesus, why do we have so many sub-folders?" Amy muttered.
Jay returned to his desk, immediately diving back into the spreadsheet that had consumed the last two hours, but shortly after Luc appeared.
"Jay. Can you format these client profiles? The template's giving me trouble."
"I'm in the middle of—"
"Please? It's for the board packet, and I'm drowning here."
Jay glanced toward Ian's office. Through the glass wall, he could see Ian hunched over his computer. He wanted to see if Ian needed anything, but Luc was already pulling up a chair.
"Fine. Send me the files."
From the corner of his eye, Jay caught Ian emerging from his office, moving toward the kitchen. Their eyes met briefly, and Jay wanted to join him, to have even a thirty-second conversation about something other than data formatting. But Luc was already launching into another technical complaint, and by the time Jay looked up again, Ian was gone.
The pattern repeated throughout the day. Jay would finish one task only to be intercepted by another colleague with another urgent request. Each one was necessary and time-sensitive. And each one kept Jay anchored to his desk or someone else's, never free to step into Ian's office for a check-in.
Even Ian seemed affected. The man who always maintained perfect composure appeared increasingly strained as the days wore on, his jaw tight and his responses clipped. Jay saw him staring at spreadsheets with resentment, which was so unlike him that Jay wondered if he was imagining things.
"Hartwell is more demanding than anticipated. It's just one client, but the reporting requirements are extensive," Ian muttered during one of their brief status meetings, rubbing his temples.
Jay nodded, not trusting himself to say anything more than basic acknowledgement. He was struggling to keep up with his own responsibilities, let alone provide meaningful input on strategic concerns.
The phone call from his siblings came at the worst possible moment, the caller ID showing Tim's name.
"Jay! This watch is incredible! Where did you even find something like this? Ari thinks you robbed a bank!"
"I'm glad you like it, but this is a terrible time. We're in the middle of quarterly reports and—"
"Just five minutes! We wanted to tell you about—"
"I can't. I'll call you back in a week when this is over."
"But—"
"I really can't right now. I'm sorry."
He hung up without registering their disappointment, his mind already moving to the next task. 
His gym membership went unused. The pool he had been so excited about became a distant memory. Thoughts of his diving lessons were pushed aside by the immediate crisis of deadlines and data analysis.
Saturday and Sunday blended into the weekdays, distinguished only by the fact that the building was emptier. Jay arrived early and left late, his world shrinking to the narrow corridor between his desk and Ian's office.
By six o'clock on Sunday, the office had taken on the atmosphere of a crisis centre. Papers covered every available surface. Someone had ordered dinner, and the team ate at their desks without conversation.
Jay had managed exactly two direct interactions with Ian all day, a brief handoff of formatted reports and a thirty-second status update on client communications. Each conversation had felt stilted and formal.
"I think I overextended us. Each quarter it's getting harder to manage the increased responsibilities," Ian admitted as they worked through yet another set of compliance documents.
Jay looked up from his computer, surprised by the admission. Ian never expressed doubt about strategic decisions, at least not in front of staff. "It's manageable. We're getting through it," Jay replied, though they both knew it was barely true.
Ian's smile was tired. "We are. Though I'm not sure at what cost."
When the reports were finally submitted on Thursday and the immediate crisis passed, the collective exhale from the entire team was almost audible. Jay slumped at his desk, staring blankly at his computer screen.
"That's it. We're done," Max announced.
Jay gathered his things, his mind already turning to the quarterly party the next evening. He glanced toward Ian's office, where Ian was shutting down his computer. They had worked in the same space for ten days straight, but Jay realized they had barely spoken beyond the requirements of immediate business.
The quarterly party, traditionally a celebration of successful completion, felt more like a wake for their sanity.
Jay dressed up for the occasion, selecting the dark gray three-piece suit that had made him feel confident during the business trip. Looking at himself in the mirror, he thought he looked like a senator or some other dignitary. The suit was undeniably elegant, but in the context of his normal life, it felt almost conspicuous in its quality.
Had it been this obvious during the trip? Perhaps he had been too overwhelmed by everything else to notice, but now the fine tailoring and expensive fabric seemed to announce themselves. He adjusted his tie nervously, half-expecting someone to comment, but when he arrived at the venue, no one seemed to notice or care.
The place was impeccable as always, the entertainment top-notch, the food and drink abundant. But the team drifted through it all, drained past the point of enjoyment.
Instead of networking and animated conversation, everyone gravitated toward chairs and quiet corners. The bar became a refuge, with people slouched on stools, eyes drifting between their half-finished glasses and the far wall.
Amy slumped in an armchair, Luc had claimed an entire section of seating, sprawling across it like he was recovering from a marathon. Even Max sat quietly, sipping whiskey and watching the party with unfocused eyes.
Jay sat at the bar, not interested in drinking but drawn to the relative quiet of the space.
"Rough quarter?" the bartender asked, more as a courtesy.
"The roughest yet," Jay replied, accepting a glass of wine he didn't want.
The week’s grind showed in Ian as well. His composure held, but traces of fatigue slipped through, attributed to the toll of the week’s demands. People nodded at him with sympathy, recognizing that even their seemingly indestructible CFO had been worn down.
"Even the man of steel looks beat," Kim said to Jay, gesturing toward where Ian stood in conversation with some board members. "If he's this tired, the rest of us must look like zombies."
Jay followed Kim's gesture and saw what he meant. Ian's posture was perfect, but his expression looked grim.
What Jay couldn't know was that Ian's mood had little to do with the workload itself and everything to do with the loss of their private evening conversations. The week that should have brought them together through shared overtime had instead kept them constantly surrounded by the full team, with Jay pulled in different directions by various colleagues who needed his help.
Ian had looked forward to those late nights, imagining moments where they could decompress together, share the burden of the work. Instead, he had watched Jay field constant requests from Amy, Luc, Kim, and others, his attention divided among so many people that their own interactions had been reduced to brief exchanges.
He had the perfect excuse to spend extensive time with Jay, but the circumstances made connection impossible. It was like being offered a feast while being too sick to eat.
As people began making their excuses to leave, Jay caught Ian's eye across the room. They shared a look that acknowledged the exhaustion and the relief that it was over. Tonight, they would go home to recover from a week that had tested everyone's limits.
Scene 4
Recovery and preparation
Jay sat propped against his pillows on Saturday morning, phone in hand, finally ready to face the conversations he had cut short during the week. He dialed his siblings' number, bracing himself for the inevitable complaints.
"Well, well, we were starting to think you'd forgotten we exist," Tim's voice came through with obvious irritation.
"I told you I was busy with—"
"Yeah, yeah, quarterly reports. We heard. You couldn't spare five minutes all week?"
"I'm sorry about that. The quarterly reports were—"
"Were more important than your family. You get a new, fancy job, and suddenly we're no longer worth your time." 
"You don't understand. Gifts this expensive don't come for free. I have to pay my dues by giving up about a week of my lifespan every quarter to reporting demands. It's non-negotiable."
"That's a bit dramatic, don't you think?" Tim shot back.
"Tim, stop it." Ema's voice cut through his complaints. "You don't understand the grown-up working world. Jay had responsibilities."
Jay felt a wave of gratitude toward his sister. "Thank you, Ema. It really was impossible to take personal calls."
"We know," Ema said warmly. "Now tell us about these amazing gifts. Tim hasn't taken the watch off since it arrived."
The tension dissolved as his siblings launched into enthusiastic descriptions of their presents. Jay listened with growing amusement as they detailed every feature of their gifts, comparing them to friends' possessions and generally reveling in the splendour.
"Where did you even find stuff like this?" Ari asked. "The headphones are incredible. I can hear things in my music I never noticed before."
"We went to make a deal with an electronics company. The gifts were one of the perks of the business trip. You should see the laptop I got out of it. It makes all your gifts look modest in comparison," Jay explained, stretching the truth only slightly.
"No way. What kind of laptop?" Tim asked. 
Jay glanced at the sleek machine sitting on his table, still barely touched. "Top of the line everything. More processing power than I'll ever need."
"That's so cool," Ari said, then his voice turned hesitant. "Um, Jay? What are you going to do with your old laptop?"
Jay looked at his faithful college computer, battered and slow but still functional. The idea of throwing it away had been bothering him for days. "Why do you ask?"
"Well, Mom and Dad won't buy me one, and Tim won't share his. I was just wondering..."
Jay thought about it for a moment. The old machine had served him well through college and his early working years. Maybe a few more years of heavy use by his youngest brother wasn't a bad retirement strategy. At least his hard work from college would be properly utilized.
"Alright. I'll make arrangements to send it to you."
Ari's screech of joy was so loud Jay had to hold the phone away from his ear.
"Really? You're serious?"
"Yes, but you have to promise to take good care of it. And help with homework, not just games."
"I promise! I promise everything!"
"I'll get it shipped next week."
They talked for another half hour, with Jay sharing edited stories from his trip while his siblings asked him questions. By the time they hung up, the stress had started to lift and Jay finally smiled.
The gym felt foreign after more than a week away. Jay approached the front desk with the resignation, expecting punishment.
"Look what the cat dragged in," Rus called from across the floor. "I was starting to think you'd found a new trainer."
"I told you this would happen."
Rus crossed his arms, his expression stern but concerned. "A week and a half, Jay. That's not a missed session, that's abandoning your routine entirely."
"I know, I know. But please be gentle today. I just survived the worst quarter of my career and I'm practically on death's door."
"That bad?"
"Worse. I worked seven days straight, slept maybe four hours a night, and lived on coffee and whatever food got delivered to the office."
"Jesus. Alright, we'll take it easy today. But only because you look like hell."
"I feel like hell."
"When's the last time you ate a real meal?"
Jay had to think about it. "Thursday? Maybe Wednesday."
"Right. Light workout today, and I'm writing you a meal plan. You can't maintain any kind of fitness routine if you're going to crash your system every three months."
The workout was mercifully basic, but even the simple movements felt awkward after days of hunching over computers. Jay's body protested every move, reminding him of how completely he had neglected everything outside of work.
"This is exactly why consistency matters," Rus observed as Jay struggled with a basic stretch.
"I know. It won't happen again."
"It will, though. That's the problem."
Jay couldn't argue with that assessment. "Just four times a year."
"That's four times too many if you ask me."
Jay spent the rest of the weekend on basic maintenance. He did laundry, grocery shopping, and the minimum household chores necessary to function. The remainder of the time he was horizontal on his couch, catching up on sleep and trying to process the emotional exhaustion that had accumulated during the week. By Sunday evening, he felt better.
He returned to an office that felt subdued, almost shell-shocked, on Monday morning. His colleagues moved through their tasks with sluggishly, still recovering from the trauma. 
Jay threw himself into the fallout from the quarterly reports, minor corrections to submitted documents, the inevitable cleanup that always followed such intense periods. But he was distracted, going through the motions while struggling to focus.
By seven o'clock, the office had emptied except for Jay, who was still working through a backlog of administrative tasks. Outside, the autumn darkness had set in, making the building feel isolated.
"Working late again?"
Jay looked up to see Ian approaching with two cups of coffee.
"Just catching up on things that got pushed aside last week."
Ian sat on the chair next to Jay's desk and set one of the coffee cups within Jay's reach. "I brought reinforcements. Everything alright?"
Jay stared at his computer screen for a moment before answering. "Nothing's wrong, exactly. The opposite, actually. Things are good. The week was brutal, but apart from that, I don't really have anything to complain about. I feel confident, hopeful about the future."
"That sounds positive."
"It is. Which is precisely the problem. Every time I've felt this way before, something happened to put me back in my place. So I guess I'm just bracing for impact, trying not to get too comfortable with feeling good about myself."
"Failure is part of life, especially in an environment like this. I can't promise things will never go wrong again, because they almost certainly will."
Jay's shoulders sagged slightly.
"But," Ian continued, "you already know you can survive setbacks. You've done it multiple times, and you get better at handling them each time. Look at where you are now compared to when you started here. That progression isn't coincidence or luck. You seized every opportunity. Don't forget that, even when things get difficult."
"You have more faith in me than I have in myself."
"I have a clearer perspective. You're too close to your own struggles to see how consistently you overcome them."
Jay felt some of the tension in his chest ease. "Thank you. I needed to hear that."
The following weeks, Jay focused on preparation. He resumed his pool sessions and finished the diving course. Ina put him through increasingly complex scenarios, building his confidence for the trip ahead.
"You're ready. The open water will be different, but you have all the skills you need."
"I hope so. It still feels surreal that I'm actually doing this."
"Best way to conquer fear is to walk straight through it."
At the gym, Rus gradually rebuilt Jay's routine, though he remained skeptical about the sustainability of the schedule.
"You're making good progress," Rus admitted, "but what happens during the next quarterly crisis?"
"I'll try to maintain some kind of routine. Maybe shorter sessions, but something."
"We'll see."
Jay also finally transferred his data to the new laptop, a process that took an entire evening and left him impressed by the machine's capabilities. When he packaged up his college laptop to send to Ari, he felt like he was saying goodbye to an era of his life.
The occasional overtime resumed, but at manageable levels, and the evening conversations with Ian became a regular feature again.
They would meet in the small kitchen area around six o'clock, both making their final coffee of the day while discussing everything from work challenges to random observations about city life.
"Doesn't the caffeine keep you awake?" Ian asked one evening as Jay prepared his beverage.
"I'm usually so tired I fall asleep immediately anyway."
"Are you pushing yourself too hard? I don't want you burning out."
"I don't think so. This feels sustainable, unlike the quarterly madness. I can handle the regular workload."
"Good. Because I'd rather have you working at eighty percent indefinitely than at one hundred percent until you collapse."
Jay felt a warmth that had nothing to do with the coffee. "I'm not pushing myself too hard."
"I'm glad to hear it."
As his departure date approached, Jay realized he felt as ready as he could possibly be. The diving skills were as solid as they could be and his documents were in order. Most importantly, he was returning to something good when he came back. It was a decent foundation to build from, and Jay allowed himself to believe it might last.
Scene 5
Vacation
On Friday afternoon, as Jay made his rounds with final farewells, a surprising warmth spread through the office. He had expected polite wishes for a good trip, but instead got enveloped in a series of embraces.
Max was the first to pull him into a hearty hug. "Don't do anything too adventurous down there. We need you back in one piece."
"I'll try to keep the sharks at bay," Jay replied, surprised by how natural the embrace felt.
Amy followed suit. "Can't believe you're actually doing this. Solo diving trip to the tropics. Very impressive."
Luc's hug lasted longer than the others. "You better come back in one piece, Hall. I've gotten used to having someone competent around here."
"I'll do my best."
"See that you do."
Zoe approached with a warm smile and a folded piece of paper. "This is everything you absolutely must do while you're there," she said, pressing the list into his hands along with a brief hug. "Rent an underwater camera for photos, and try to spot parrotfish if you can. Oh, and remember to equalize frequently during descents. Some people forget when they're excited."
Jay unfolded the list, finding detailed diving tips and marine life recommendations. "This is incredibly thoughtful. Thank you."
"You're going to love it."
His final conversation of the day took place in Ian's office, where Jay knocked on the doorframe in the late afternoon light.
"Do you have a moment?"
Ian looked up from his computer, immediately giving Jay his full attention. "Of course. All set for your adventure?"
"I think so. Triple-checked everything. What about your plans? A whole week off must feel strange."
"Nothing specific. Might visit some old friends, catch up on reading."
The vague response felt deliberate, but Jay didn't press. "That sounds nice. Relaxing."
"Exactly."
In reality, Ian had no plans at all. A week without Jay was an ordeal to be endured, not an enjoyable vacation. But sharing that information seemed inappropriate, potentially burdensome.
Both were aware that this was goodbye for more than a week. Jay was reluctant to leave, wanted to extend the conversation indefinitely. Ian seemed similarly hesitant to bring their time to a close.
"You should get home and finish packing," Ian said finally.
"Right. Early flight tomorrow."
"I want you to be careful out there. Follow the safety protocols, don't take unnecessary risks."
"I won't. Ina drilled proper procedures into me pretty thoroughly."
Jay wanted to say something meaningful, to acknowledge how much these conversations had come to mean to him, but the words felt too large.
Ian got up, coming around his desk. For a moment they stood facing each other, closer than their normal interactions required. Jay wanted to offer some physical gesture of farewell, and from Ian's expression, the impulse was mutual.
But the office setting, the uncertainty of what such a gesture might mean or imply, created a barrier that neither could cross. They stood awkwardly, both wanting something they couldn't name or claim.
"Have a wonderful trip," Ian said.
"Thank you. I'll see you when I get back."
Jay forced himself to turn and walk away, fighting the urge to look back as he headed for the elevator. Behind him, Ian remained standing in his office doorway until the elevator doors closed.
Jay woke up on Saturday morning at five-thirty, with his alarm still an hour away. He lay in bed for a moment, acknowledging that further sleep was impossible. The night was restless. Every half hour brought him bolt upright, checking his phone, then lying back down to repeat the process.
Finally he got up to begin his final preparations. Coffee first, strong and black to cut through the fog of exhaustion. Then a shower to wake himself up properly. One final review of his documents, passport, tickets, diving certification cards.
Everything was exactly as he had left it the night before, and the night before that, and every night for the past week.
The public transport to the airport felt surreal, a ordinary commute that was taking him toward an extraordinary personal milestone. He watched other passengers, wondering who else might be embarking on solo adventures, who else might be pushing past their comfort zones into unknown territory.
The airport was less intimidating than expected. His early arrival gave him ample time to get through check-in and security, and he located his gate without difficulty. The four-hour flight in economy class was cramped compared to his recent experience with Ian, but tolerable. More importantly, flying no longer frightened him the way it once had.
When they landed in Lagoon Belt, humid, flower-scented air rushed in and the immediate disorientation of being somewhere completely foreign set in. The taxi ride to his hotel provided glimpses of palm trees and an ocean bluer than any body of water he had ever seen.
The hotel staff greeted him, providing pamphlets about local activities and evening entertainment options. 
"Welcome party starts at seven. Great way to meet your fellow divers," the desk clerk informed him cheerfully. 
Jay thanked her and went to his room to unpack and try to calm his nerves. He spread the materials across his bed, suddenly overwhelmed by having to be responsible for his own itinerary in a place where he knew no one.
The party was larger and livelier than Jay expected. He wore his resort wear from the company retreat, feeling slightly overdressed. The gathering happened across a beachside terrace, with music, local cuisine, and an abundance of alcohol that quickly loosened tongues and inhibitions.
Jay positioned himself near the edge of the crowd, holding a beer and trying to blend into the background. His strategy worked until a boisterous instructor spotted him.
"First time diving in tropical waters?" he asked, sitting beside Jay without invitation.
"Second, but it's my first time diving solo."
"Excellent! I'm Ash, I'll be your instructor. You're going to love it out there. The visibility is incredible, and we've got some fantastic coral formations. Have you seen many tropical fish before? The variety here is amazing. There's a resident green moray that likes to hang out near the drop-off..."
Ash launched into an enthusiastic monologue about local marine life and diving conditions that lasted nearly two hours. Jay was content to listen, asking occasional questions that kept Ash talking while requiring minimal participation on his own part. The arrangement suited them both: Ash had an attentive audience, and Jay could participate socially without the pressure of carrying conversation.
By ten o'clock, travel fatigue was weighing heavily on Jay's eyelids. He made his excuses, weathering Ash's protests about leaving early.
"Come on, the night's just getting started! This is when the real stories come out!"
"I'm sure they do, but I'm completely exhausted. Long day of travel."
"Alright, alright. Tomorrow we dive, so rest up. You'll need your energy."
Jay retreated to his room, showered quickly, and went into bed, falling asleep instantly. 
On Sunday morning, Jay encountered a truly tropical environment. He walked the hotel grounds in wonder, marvelling at palm trees, white sand, and water in shades of turquoise and deep blue.
The ocean here was different from the seaside of his country in every way. Where home waters were cold and grey-green, these were warm and brilliantly coloured, with beaches that stretched for miles and waves that crashed with impressive force.
Jay spread his towel on the hot sand and lay back, enjoying the morning breeze. His mind felt completely quiet, freed from the constant undercurrent of work concerns and personal anxieties.
His first dive happened in the early afternoon. Jay had expected more nerves, but descending into the warm, clear water felt natural after the months of pool training. His small group of fellow novices moved clumsily at first, but Ash's patient guidance and the forgiving conditions made the experience enjoyable.
Swimming among fish, seeing coral formations, Jay felt a sense of accomplishment. This was purely personal, a goal he had set and achieved entirely for himself.
Later that afternoon, he explored the nearby town, a collection of old continent architecture that seemed transported from another era. At the post office, he selected postcards for his siblings and, on impulse, one for the office. The messages were brief: "Weather beautiful, diving amazing, wish you were here."
The evening's congratulatory dinner celebrating everyone's successful first dive was loud as alcohol flowed. Jay participated enough to be sociable but excused himself early, claiming exhaustion that was entirely real.
The rest of the week moved along in a similar pattern. Morning dives or afternoon sessions, depending on conditions and scheduling. Beach time when he wasn't underwater, either sunbathing or swimming in the ocean. Evening walks around the hotel grounds, appreciating the tropical flowers and the sound of waves.
The diving itself was easier than expected. His technique improved each day, and his confidence in the underwater environment grew. Jay's photos weren't particularly good, but they captured enough of the experience to serve as meaningful reminders.
Ash remained his primary social contact, still as talkative and outgoing as ever, but his attention was distributed among all the guests. Most other participants were couples or friend groups, and the few solo travellers like himself seemed content with their own company.
Jay attended enough group activities to be polite but skipped most evening parties in favour of solitary pursuits. Walks, meals at the hotel restaurant, sightseeing the local town. It suited his temperament perfectly.
By week's end, he had earned his open water certification and accumulated a collection of small souvenirs: local snacks, postcards, a few pieces of simple jewelry that caught his eye. More importantly, he had proven to himself that solo travel was not only survivable but enjoyable.
The return journey felt both too soon and perfectly timed. Jay was tanned, thoroughly exercised from daily diving and swimming, and content with his week. As the plane lifted off from Lagoon Belt, he thought about Ian's vacation, wondering if it had been equally restorative.
The thought led to a comparison between this trip and his recent travels with Ian. Both had been successful in their own ways, but the company retreat and New Continent trip had felt more significant, more memorable. Perhaps because they had been shared experiences, or perhaps because Ian had made every moment feel special.
This vacation had been good for him. But he was glad to be returning home.
Jay got back to his apartment on Saturday evening, and spent Sunday unpacking, sorting clothes for laundry and redistributing items among his collection of suitcases. The tropical warmth was already a memory as chilly November air crept through his windows. Halloween had passed entirely unnoticed while he was away, and evening was falling with the early darkness of approaching winter.
None of the seasonal transition bothered him. The overcast skies and cooling temperatures felt refreshing. He was back in the city that had become his own, in the life he had built for himself. 
Jay finished his unpacking, already looking forward to Monday morning. He was home. Or rather, he would be home tomorrow, right where he belonged: in front of Ian's office, ready to resume their shared work.
