Chapter 40: The storm before the calm
Scene 1
Family visit
Jay stood in the kitchen, checking the oven one last time. The roast chicken was golden brown, the vegetables caramelized at the edges. The soup simmered on the stove, filling the apartment with the scent of herbs and broth. He'd made the kinds of things his mother used to cook when he was young. Simple, hearty food that tasted like home.
His phone buzzed at quarter to seven.
"We're five minutes away," his mother texted.
Jay grabbed his keys and headed downstairs. The evening air was pleasant. He waited at the entrance, watching the traffic until his mother's car pulled up to the curb. The doors opened and chaos erupted.
"Jay!" Ema was the first out, running toward him with her arms outstretched.
"Look at you. Did you grow taller?"
"Maybe a little."
Tim emerged next, followed by Ari, both stretching after the long drive. His mother climbed out last, looking tired but happy.
"There's underground parking. Follow me."
He led them around to the garage entrance, waving at the security camera as the gate rolled open. His mother followed him down the ramp, eyes widening at the spotless garage with its bright lights and neatly numbered bays. Jay walked ahead, gesturing toward a reserved space marked with his name.
“This one’s ours,” he said.
She parked, still taking in the polished surroundings, while the boys jumped out to start unloading the bags from the trunk.
"I can carry mine," Ema insisted, dragging her backpack.
"Let me help," Jay said, taking the heavier cases.
They piled into the elevator. Ari pressed the button for the fourth floor and grinned when the doors closed smoothly.
"This is so fancy," Tim said.
"It's new construction. Everything's still shiny," Jay explained.
The elevator opened into a bright hallway with clean white walls. Jay unlocked his door and held it open.
"Welcome."
They came in, dropping bags and shoes in the entryway. Ema ran straight to the windows.
"You can see the river!"
"And the park. Come on, I'll show you around."
The apartment wasn't large, but it felt spacious. His mother walked through slowly, running her hand along the countertop in the open kitchen.
"It's beautiful. So clean and bright."
Tim and Ari immediately zeroed in on the entertainment console beneath the television.
"Is that the new model?" Tim asked.
"It is."
"Can we play later?"
"After dinner."
Ema was still at the window, pressing her hands against the glass. "I love this view. Can I take pictures?"
"Take as many as you want."
His mother opened the refrigerator, inspecting the contents with approval. "You're eating properly. That's good."
"I cook most nights now."
"I'm glad to hear it. The place suits you. Tidy, organized, but cosy."
"Thank you."
"Now, what smells so good?"
"Dinner's ready. Sit down, I'll serve."
They gathered around the small dining table, which Jay had extended to its full length. He brought out the soup first, ladling it into bowls. Then the chicken, potatoes, and roasted vegetables.
"This looks amazing," his mother said.
"I wanted to make something homey."
They ate with enthusiasm. Ema described her school play. Tim talked about his football team making the regional finals. Ari complained about his maths teacher but admitted he was doing well in history.
"And how's work?" his mother asked Jay.
"Busy. We just finished quarterly reporting."
"That sounds stressful."
"It was. But it's over now."
"Your boss treats you well?"
"Very well. Ian's excellent."
"I'm glad."
After dinner, Ema retrieved a bag from the entryway. "We brought presents."
"You didn't have to—"
"Housewarming and birthday. Open them."
She handed him three painted cache pots, each decorated by one of his siblings. Ema's was covered in tiny flowers and vines. Tim's featured abstract geometric patterns in blue and silver. Ari's had bold orange stripes on a green background.
"We made them for your plant," Ema explained. 
Jay looked at the pots, then at his siblings. "These are wonderful. Thank you."
His mother produced a wrapped package next. "From me."
Inside was a set of high grade kitchen knives. Beneath them were jars of homemade jam and a container of cookies.
"Mom, this is too much—"
"Nonsense. You need good tools if you're cooking regularly. And I know you like my preserves."
Jay set the jars on the counter, then picked up the orange-and-green pot. It was garish and loud, completely unlike anything else in his apartment. But it had been painted by his youngest brother with care.
He retrieved his spider plant and put into the pot. The colours clashed magnificently with the tones of the room, but somehow it worked.
"Looks great," Ema declared.
"It really does," Jay agreed.
They loaded the dishwasher together, his mother insisting on helping despite Jay's protests. Tim and Ari wiped down the counters. Then came the question of sleeping arrangements.
"You and Ema take the bedroom. Tim and Ari can have the couch. I'll sleep on the floor."
"That's not fair to you—"
"It's fine. I've already set everything up."
He showed them the mattress he'd arranged, tucked beside the table with pillows and blankets. It looked cosy enough.
His mother relented. "If you're sure."
"I am."
They prepared for bed. The boys claimed the bathroom first, emerging in sleep clothes and immediately commandeering the console. Ema and his mother took longer.
Jay showered last and returned to find Tim and Ari deeply engaged in a racing game.
"Don't stay up too late," he said.
"We won't."
His mother appeared in the doorway, already in her nightgown. "This is a lovely apartment, Jay. Really. I'm so proud of you."
"Thanks, Mom."
"Sleep well."
"You too."
Jay retreated to his makeshift bed. It was a bit cramped, and he could hear the boys' game, but he didn't mind. He closed his eyes and let the sounds of his family lull him to sleep.
The next morning began with breakfast. Jay made scrambled eggs and toast.
"What's the plan?" Tim asked.
"City tour. I'll show you around. Then lunch, and we'll visit my old neighbourhood."
"Can we ride the metro?" Ari asked.
"Of course."
They left at ten, stepping out into a perfect June day. The weather was warm but not oppressive, with a light breeze coming off the river. Jay led them through the park to the metro station.
"This is so much nicer than our trains," Ema said, marvelling at the clean platforms and modern carriages.
When they reached their stop, Jay led them toward the Northlight Financial Center. The glass tower gleamed in the sunlight, imposing and elegant.
"That's where I work. Thirty-fourth floor."
"It's huge," Tim said.
"Can we go inside?" Ema asked.
"Just the lobby."
They entered through the main doors. The reception area was all marble and polished metal, with a massive chandelier hanging overhead. The receptionist at the desk looked up and smiled.
"Good morning, Mr. Hall." She waved at them cheerfully. His siblings stared.
"She knows your name?" Ari whispered.
"I come through here every day."
"That's so cool."
They didn't linger. Jay ushered them back outside before anyone else could recognize him. His family was impressed enough already.
"Ice cream?" he asked.
"Yes!" Ema said immediately.
He took them to a small artisanal shop near the park, the one with flavours like lavender honey and brown butter. They each chose different ones and ate while walking through the paths. 
"This is really good," his mother said, savouring her pistachio cone.
"I come here sometimes after work."
"It must be nice, living so close to everything."
"It is."
For lunch, he brought them to Willow & Sage. The bistro was busy but they found a table by the window. Jay recommended the seasonal soup and the chicken sandwich. His mother ordered the quiche. The food was excellent, as always. His mother declared the quiche the best she'd ever had. The boys finished their sandwiches quickly and eyed the dessert menu.
"Maybe late. We have more to see."
They walked through the financial district. His siblings took photos of the skyscrapers. Then they took the metro to the old town, emerging in the neighbourhood where Jay had lived when he first moved to the city. The streets were narrower here, the buildings older but charming.
"I rented a studio in that building," Jay said, pointing. "Fourth floor, no elevator."
"How small was it?" Ari asked.
"Very small."
They visited the history museum, which Ari found fascinating, and took photos in front of the landmark statues in the main square.
"One more stop," Jay said.
He led them to Café Lemon. Fay was behind the counter, and she lit up when she saw him.
"Jay! And you brought guests."
"My family. This is my mom, and my siblings—Ema, Tim, and Ari."
"Wonderful to meet you all. What can I get you?"
They ordered tea and pastries. Fay brought everything to their table personally, along with an extra plate of biscuits.
"On the house," she said.
They sat for a while, relaxing after the long day of walking. By the time they left, it was late afternoon. Jay hailed a taxi to take them back across the city. The kids were tired but happy. Jay took them to an upscale restaurant near his building for dinner. Ema looked nervous.
Jay ordered for the table, choosing dishes he knew his family would enjoy. The meal was excellent. His mother praised everything. The kids were on their best behaviour.
After dinner, they walked along the riverside boulevard. The evening was beautiful. Ema and Tim took endless selfies. Ari asked questions about the buildings and Jay answered as best he could. They found a small pier with a fountain and benches arranged around it. 
"My feet are definitely going to fall off," Ema said dramatically, dropping onto a bench.
The boys sat on either side of her. Jay and his mother took the bench opposite. For a few minutes, they just rested. Then his mother spoke.
"I'm very proud of you, Jay. When you first moved here, I worried. You were so young. But look at you now. You have a beautiful home, a good job. You've built a real life here."
"I've been lucky. I found a great job. Good fortune followed."
"It's not just luck. You worked hard. You persevered through difficult times. You should be proud of yourself."
"Thank you, Mom. Let's head home before it gets too late."
By the time they reached the apartment, everyone was thoroughly exhausted.
"Tomorrow I'll take you shopping. You can each pick a birthday present."
"Really?" Ema's eyes lit up.
"Really. Within reason."
"What's reason?" Ari asked.
"You'll find out. Also, my colleagues are planning a small birthday thing tomorrow evening. Just an hour or so at a pub."
"Your work friends?" his mother asked.
"Yes. They insisted on organizing it. I hope that's alright."
"Of course. It sounds lovely."
They prepared for bed again. Jay lay on his mattress on the floor, self-conscious about all the praise, but underneath that, he felt the comfort of having people who cared about him close by.
Scene 2
Affection
Saturday morning began with the chaos of four people trying to use one bathroom. Jay made breakfast while waiting for his turn, scrambling eggs and toasting bread. Ema was already planning her shopping strategy.
"I want to look at everything before deciding," she announced.
"That'll take hours," Tim said.
"So?"
"So the rest of us will die of boredom."
"Then don't come with me."
"We're all going together," their mother said firmly. "And you'll be reasonable about what you choose."
Ema sighed dramatically but nodded.
They took his mother's car, Jay navigating from the passenger seat. The mall was busy but manageable. Ema made a beeline for the clothing stores.
"Can I get a dress?" she asked.
"You can get whatever you want."
Her eyes went wide. His mother immediately intervened.
"Within reason. You don't need six dresses."
"But they're all so pretty—"
"Pick two. And maybe a nice top."
They spent an hour in various shops while Ema deliberated. Tim and Ari sat on a bench outside the store, playing on their phones.
She tried on everything, asked everyone's opinion, changed her mind repeatedly. Eventually she decided on a floral sundress and a more formal navy one, plus a blouse with embroidered sleeves.
The boys were more decisive. Tim wanted new trekking boots and a jersey. Ari asked for books and a model ship kit. 
"You're spoiling them," his mother said.
They loaded their bags into the car and returned to the mall's food court for lunch. The siblings were thrilled with their gifts.
Jay's phone buzzed while he was eating.
"I need to inform you that I'm collecting your family at three. We're going shopping for proper attire before the event." Luc's text read.
Jay stared at the message. His stomach sank.
"What's wrong?" his mother asked.
"Nothing. Just work."
He called Luc back, stepping away from the table.
"What do you mean, proper attire?"
"It's a nice venue. They need nice clothes."
"This is supposed to be casual—"
"It is casual. Casually upscale. Trust me, they'll thank me later."
"Luc—"
"Three o'clock. Don't argue."
The call ended. Jay returned to the table, trying not to look annoyed.
"Everything alright?" his mother asked.
"Fine. My colleague wants to take you shopping this afternoon before the party."
"That's not necessary—"
"I know. But he's insistent."
They finished lunch and returned to the apartment to drop off the bags. Jay had barely set everything down when the intercom buzzed.
"Hello?"
"It's Luc. Let me up."
Jay buzzed him in. A minute later, there was a knock on the door. Jay opened it.
Luc stood there with Leo.
"Hello. We're here for the makeover," Leo said with a huge grin.
Jay stared. "Why are you here?"
"I'm helping."
"That's not an explanation."
"Can we come in?"
Jay stepped aside, deeply suspicious. His family gathered in the living room, looking uncertain.
"This is Luc and Leo. They work with me. Apparently they're taking you shopping."
Leo immediately approached Jay's mother with his most charming smile.
"You must be Mrs. Hall. I'm Leo Turner. Lovely to meet you."
"Oh. Hello."
"And you must be Ema, Tim, and Ari. Jay's told us so much about you."
"He has?" Ema asked.
"Constantly. He's very proud of you all."
Jay felt a headache forming. He grabbed Leo's arm and pulled him into the kitchen bedroom.
"What are you really doing here?"
Leo's smile didn't waver. "Can't I just want to celebrate your birthday?"
"No."
"Fine. I have an ulterior motive."
"I knew it."
"Ian turns forty in September. That's a big milestone. He needs a proper celebration."
"He hates parties."
"Exactly. Which is why I need to soften him up to the idea first. Tonight seems like a perfect opportunity. Small gathering, casual atmosphere. He'll see it's not so terrible."
"You're using my birthday party to manipulate Ian into tolerating his own birthday party?"
"When you say it like that, it sounds bad."
"Because it is bad."
"Jay, listen. Ian never celebrates anything. He never lets anyone do anything nice for him. He spends every birthday working late and pretending it's just another day. Don't you think he deserves better?"
Jay wanted to argue, but he couldn't, because Leo was right.
"He needs more in his life than just work," Leo continued. "You know that as well as I do. Maybe better. So help me out here. Let tonight be a test run. Show him that gatherings with friends can actually be pleasant."
Jay sighed. "Fine. Do whatever you want."
They returned to the living room. Luc had already charmed Jay's siblings and was explaining the plan.
"We'll split up. I'll take Tim and Ari. Leo will take Mrs. Hall and Ema. That way we can cover more ground."
"What about Jay?" his mother asked.
"Ian's picking him up at six. Jay, wear something nice."
Jay's mother looked at him questioningly. Jay nodded.
"Alright then," she said.
Before Jay could protest further, they were herding his family out the door. Ema waved enthusiastically. His mother looked bemused.
The door closed and the apartment fell silent. Jay sighed heavily and checked the time. Two hours.
He tidied up the apartment, then he showered, taking his time.
When he emerged, he dried off and went to his closet. The navy three-piece suit was the obvious choice. He dressed up, adding the sapphire cufflinks and matching tiepin. His hair had been cut recently and still held its shape. He combed it, checking his reflection.
He looked presentable. Hopefully not overdressed.
At quarter to six, he sat on the couch and waited, hoping this wouldn't turn into a disaster. The buzzer rang at ten minutes before six.
Jay opened the door. Ian stood there in a pale gray suit, looking dashing.
"Hello," Ian said.
"Hi. Come in."
Ian stepped inside, closing the door behind him. "You look very nice."
"Thanks. I'm sorry about all this. Luc turned it into an entire production."
"That's Luc's nature."
"I know, but still. It was supposed to be casual." Jay caught himself before he complained too much. The whole point was to get Ian comfortable with celebrations. "I mean, it's fine. I'm sure it'll be nice."
"I'm sure it will be."
Ian reached into his jacket and produced a small wrapped box.
"What's that?"
"A gift."
"You already gave me a gift."
"That was for your home. But since there's a party, I couldn't arrive empty-handed."
"Ian—"
"Please."
Jay took the box and unwrapped it. Inside was a set of cufflinks and a tiepin, white gold and onyx. The design was modern, geometric, more serious than the sapphire set.
"These are beautiful," Jay whispered.
"I thought they'd suit you."
Jay felt heat rise in his face. It wasn't the first time Ian had given him a gift, but this moment felt different, more weighted. His heart was beating too fast.
"Thank you," he managed.
He tried to remove the sapphire cufflinks he was wearing, but his hands trembled slightly. He fumbled with the mechanism.
"Here," Ian said gently. "Let me."
He took Jay's wrist, removing the cufflink. Then the other one. He replaced them with the new set.
Jay stood frozen, watching Ian's hands work. The touch was light, but the intimacy of the gesture made his breath catch.
Ian finished with the cufflinks and reached for the tiepin.
"May I?"
Jay nodded, not trusting his voice.
Ian removed the sapphire pin and replaced it with the onyx one, adjusting it so it sat perfectly straight. His fingers brushed Jay's chest through the fabric.
"There," Ian said.
Jay looked up and found Ian watching him. Their faces were close. Then Ian stepped back.
"We should go."
"Yes," Jay agreed, his voice slightly unsteady.
They left the apartment together. Ian's car was parked at the curb. He opened the passenger door for Jay.
Jay watched the city pass outside the window, acutely aware of Ian beside him. His wrist still felt warm where Ian had touched it. His hands were still trembling.
"Are you nervous?" Ian asked.
"A little. My family meeting my colleagues feels strange."
"They'll get along well."
"I hope so."
Jay glanced at Ian's profile, at his hands resting on the steering wheel.
He thought about those same hands fastening his cufflinks, adjusting the tiepin. The focused expression on Ian's face, the gentleness of his touch. Jay looked away quickly, his heart racing again.
This was dangerous territory. He knew that. But it felt like something more than mentorship.
It felt like affection.
Ian pulled into a parking space near the venue. He turned off the engine but didn't immediately move to leave.
"Jay."
"Yes?"
"I hope you have a good evening. You deserve to be celebrated."
"Thank you. For everything. Not just tonight. For all of it."
"It's my pleasure."
They sat for a moment longer, then Ian opened his door. "Shall we?"
"Yes."
They walked to the venue together, close but not touching, both maintaining the line neither was brave enough to cross.
Scene 3
Celebration
Jay stopped in his tracks when he saw the restaurant's entrance.
"The Palladium."
"Yes."
"Did Leo organized this?"
"I believe so."
Jay pushed through the doors and immediately spotted Leo holding a glass of wine near the private dining room entrance. He sent him a vicious glare. Leo smiled innocently and raised his glass in greeting.
The private room was elegant without being oppressively formal, servers moving discreetly between guests. Still, it was one of the most expensive restaurants in the city.
"Jay!"
His mother approached, and Jay barely recognized her. She wore a deep green dress that skimmed her knees, her hair styled and wearing makeup. Ema was beside her in a cream-coloured dress with delicate beading, looking thrilled with herself.
"You both look beautiful," Jay said.
"Leo's stylist was very skilled," his mother said. There was wariness in her voice, like she wasn't entirely comfortable with the situation.
Tim and Ari appeared next, both in well-cut suits that somehow managed to look relaxed despite being clearly designer. Tim tugged at his collar.
"These are really comfortable. I thought fancy suits were supposed to be stiff."
"You look very handsome," Jay assured him.
His mother stepped back, examining Jay with obvious pride. "Look at you. So refined."
"Mom—"
"You look like you belong here," Ema added.
"I don't know about that—"
"You do. I'm so proud," his mother insisted.
"Thank you."
Rus appeared, grinning widely, wearing a burgundy shirt and black trousers that actually fit properly. Beside him, Mic and Van were similarly well-dressed.
"Luc's work?" Jay asked.
"Obviously. Happy birthday."
"Thanks."
Luc himself was near the bar with his flatmate Gav. He waved at Jay. Most of Jay's colleagues were already present—Zoe, Amy, Max, Ela, and Kim clustered together near the windows. And Rin, standing awkwardly in the corner by himself.
Jay made his way over.
"Rin. I'm glad you came."
Rin looked relieved. "Luc said I should. I hope that's alright."
"Of course it is."
"I wasn't sure if—since I'm still new—"
"You're part of the team. Stay as long as you like."
Rin relaxed slightly.
Jay's mother approached, watching the exchange. After Rin wandered toward the drinks table, she whispered.
"That young man works for you?"
"He's a junior analyst. I've been helping him."
"You have subordinates." She sounded surprised.
Ian stood near the entrance, surveying the room. Jay's mother looked at him. Her expression cooled slightly.
"That's your boss."
"Yes. Ian Hagen."
"He seems very formal."
Ian noticed them and approached. "Mrs. Carter. It's a pleasure to meet you properly."
"Mr. Hagen." Her tone was polite but notably lacking in warmth.
"I hope you're enjoying the city."
"Jay's been an excellent guide."
"I'm sure he has."
There was a pause. Jay could feel the tension, the way his mother's shoulders had gone slightly rigid. Ian seemed to sense it too. He didn't push for more conversation, simply inclined his head and said, "Please let me know if you need anything this evening."
"Thank you."
He moved away, giving them space. Jay watched him go, then looked at his mother.
"He's a good person."
"I'm sure he is."
"Mom—"
"I'm being polite, aren't I?"
"You're being vigilant."
"Rich, powerful men don't do things without reasons, Jay. I just want to make sure his reasons are good ones."
"They are. I promise."
"Alright. I trust your judgement."
The servers began directing people toward their seats. The room had been arranged with several tables, allowing for smaller conversations. Before they sat, Jay caught Ema talking animatedly with Leo, who was telling some story that made her laugh. She pulled out her phone, clearly asking for his social media.
Jay moved quickly.
"Ema—"
"Leo's so interesting! He was just telling me about art galleries."
"That's nice, but—"
"She's a delightful conversationalist," Leo said innocently.
Jay gave him a warning look. Leo's expression remained perfectly pleasant.
"Maybe talk to some other people too."
"I will!"
She bounded off toward the drinks table. Jay turned to Leo.
"Don't be a bad influence."
"I would never."
"I mean it."
"She's perfectly safe with me. I promise."
Jay wasn't entirely convinced, but he couldn't make a scene, so he let it go.
Across the room, Tim was looking lost. Jay went over.
"You alright?"
"Yeah. Just—everyone's very sophisticated."
"You see that woman over there? With the blonde hair? That's Zoe. She likes hiking and camping. You should talk to her."
Tim's face brightened. "Really?"
"Really. Go on."
Tim approached Zoe hesitantly. Within minutes they were deep in conversation, both pulling out their phones to show each other photos. Zoe was gesturing enthusiastically about some trail. Tim was grinning.
Ari, meanwhile, had planted himself firmly behind their mother and showed no signs of moving.
Jay knelt down beside him. "You can sit with me at dinner if you want."
"It's very fancy here."
"I know. But everyone's friendly. And the food will be good."
"Okay."
Jay guided him to the seat beside his own. Ari sat and looked around with wide eyes.
Dinner was served in courses. The food was exceptional, though Jay barely tasted it. He was too busy watching his family and colleagues mingle, making sure everyone was comfortable.
His mother sat with Max and Amy, both of whom were working hard to put her at ease. Max's natural joviality helped. Amy's sincere questions about the family seemed to thaw some of her reserve.
Ema had collected half the room's social media information and was taking endless selfies with anyone who would stand still long enough. Tim and Zoe had become fast friends, now discussing trail safety and wildlife photography. Luc was entertaining Rin, who laughed at something Luc said.
Gav had joined Rus's group and they were all getting progressively louder.
And Ian—
Ian was watching Jay with a tender expression. Their eyes met across the room. Ian smiled. Jay smiled back.
Leo appeared at Ian's shoulder, murmuring something. Ian's expression turned sour immediately. Leo grinned and moved away.
After dinner came the cake, a beautiful three-tiered creation that was absolutely unnecessary but looked spectacular. Everyone sang. Jay endured it with good humour, blowing out the candles while Ema recorded everything on her phone.
Then came the gifts. His colleagues presented a stack of packages that Jay promised to open later. Rus and his friends handed over a big bag that was suspiciously heavy. Gav produced an elegant bottle.
"Thank you," Jay said. "Really. This is too much."
"Nonsense," Max said. 
Jay circulated through the room, receiving wishes and making small talk. He checked on Rin, who was looking less anxious. He thanked Leo for organizing everything, despite his lingering annoyance about the venue choice.
He found Ian standing near the windows.
"How are you holding up?" 
"Very well."
"You're not bored?"
"Not at all."
"My mother's being cold to you. I'm sorry."
"It's alright. She's protective. She has every right to be cautious around someone like me."
"She just—she's not a fan of rich people generally."
"I understand."
"It's not personal."
"I know. She loves you. She wants to make sure you're safe. I respect that."
"Thank you for being here."
They stood together for a moment, watching the party continue around them.
"You're happy," Ian said.
"I am."
"Good. You should be surrounded by people who care about you more often."
"So should you."
Ian's smile turned slightly sad. "Perhaps."
By ten o'clock, people were starting to fade. Ari had fallen asleep with his head on the table. Tim and Ema were still energetic, but their mother looked tired.
"We should head home," Jay said.
"I arranged a car. They'll take you wherever you need to go," Leo said.
"You didn't have to do that," Jay said.
"Of course I did. Can't have you taking the metro after your birthday party."
"Thank you."
"You're welcome. And Jay? I'm glad you had a good time."
"I did. Despite the venue."
"The venue was perfect."
"It was obscenely expensive."
"It was appropriate. Accept nice things graciously."
Jay shook his head but smiled. "Thanks, Leo."
"Happy birthday."
They gathered coats and bags. Jay's colleagues said their goodbyes, each offering warm wishes. Rus hugged him enthusiastically.
"Best party," he declared.
"I'm glad you enjoyed it."
Sunday afternoon arrived too quickly.
Jay's family had packed their bags and loaded the car. They'd had a late lunch together, lingering over the meal as long as possible. Now they stood in the apartment's entryway, ready to leave.
"Drive safely," Jay said.
"We will." His mother hugged him tightly. "Take care of yourself."
"I will."
Ema squeezed him next. "Can I visit again?"
"Anytime."
Tim and Ari both hugged him in turn. Then they were gone. Jay went back inside and started unpacking the birthday gifts. Advanced academic textbooks from his colleagues, topics ranging from financial theory to market analysis. Various pre-workout powders and supplements from Rus, Mic, and Van. A bottle of expensive whiskey from Gav with a note apologizing again for the disastrous blind date.
And an envelope from Leo. Inside was a handwritten note on expensive stationery.
"Happy birthday. Your new jewellery is remarkable and you should have more pieces to properly present it. Appointment scheduled for next Saturday at noon. Don't be late. - L"
It was for the same tailor as last time. Jay stared at the note. He wasn't sure if he was more mad or amused.
Scene 4
Downfall
The week after Jay's birthday party should have been pleasant. Instead, it became increasingly uncomfortable. Gal had stopped hovering around Jay's desk. At first, it seemed like Ian's intervention had worked.
But by Tuesday, Jay noticed something else. Gal was watching him. Waiting for opportunities when he was alone. In the break room. By the printer.
He started avoiding those situations. He started taking coffee back to his desk before she could approach and printing documents only when others were around.
Ian noticed. Jay could see him watching through the glass wall, his expression growing increasingly concerned.
Thursday afternoon, Jay was in the archive room, retrieving files. The space was small, lined with shelves and filing cabinets.
He was reaching for a folder on the top shelf when he heard the door open.
"Jay."
He turned. Gal stepped inside and closed the door.
"Hi," he said cautiously.
"I've been wanting to talk to you."
"I'm a bit busy right now—"
"It won't take long." 
"Gal, this isn't—"
"I just want to know why you're avoiding me."
"I'm not—"
"You are. Ever since Ian spoke to me, you've barely looked at me. Is it because of what I said at the party? Because I was drunk and I didn't mean—"
"It's fine. Really. But I need to get back to work—"
She moved closer. Too close.
"Gal, please step back."
"I just want us to be friends again—"
"We are. But right now I need space."
"Why? What did I do wrong?"
She reached for his arm. Jay pulled away, but the shelves were behind him and there was nowhere to go.
"Don't touch me."
"I'm just trying to talk—"
"Gal, leave the room. Now."
Her expression crumpled. "You're just like everyone else. You think you're better than me—"
"I don't think that—"
"You do. You all do."
She turned and stormed out. The door slammed behind her. Jay stood frozen, his heart pounding. That had been bad.
He took a long moment to collect himself, then gathered the files and headed back.
When he reached his desk, the atmosphere was wrong. People were clustered in small groups, whispering. Rin looked stricken. Zoe was on her phone, her expression grim.
Ian emerged from his office.
“Jay. I need you to come with me. Conference room.”
Jay's blood turned to ice. "What happened?"
“I promise everything will be all right. But I need you to come with me now.”
Jay followed him. Inside were two people—an older, stern woman from HR and a man with a security badge he didn't recognise.
"This is Ms. Miller from HR and Mr. Oakford from security. Ms. Gray has filed a complaint."
Jay's legs nearly gave out. "What kind of complaint?"
"She's claiming you assaulted her in the archive room."
The world tilted. "What? No. I didn't—she came in while I was working and got too close and I told her to leave—"
"Please sit down," Ian said.
Jay sat. His hands were shaking.
Ms. Miller opened a tablet. "Mr. Hall, I need you to describe exactly what happened. Every detail."
Jay recounted the entire interaction. His voice was level but his mind was screaming. This couldn't be happening.
"The archive room has surveillance cameras. We're reviewing the footage now."
"Cameras?" Jay repeated.
"Every room in this building has them."
Ten minutes later, Mr. Oakford returned with his tablet. He placed it on the table and pressed play.
The footage showed everything. Jay reaching for files. Gal entering. The conversation, audio included. Her moving closer despite his clear discomfort. Him asking her to leave. Her storming out. At no point did Jay touch her.
Ms. Miller's expression was glacial. "Where is Ms. Gray now?"
"Still in the building. Waiting in Conference Room D."
"Bring her here."
Five minutes later, Gal entered. She saw the tablet and went pale.
"Ms. Gray. You filed a false report claiming Mr. Hall assaulted you. The surveillance footage shows this is completely untrue."
"I—he—"
"You have ten minutes to collect your belongings. Security will escort you out. Your termination is effective immediately. Our legal team will be in contact regarding this incident."
Gal's face went white, then red. "You can't—"
"We can and we are. Mr. Oakford, please escort her."
Security took her out. She didn't look at Jay.
Ms. Miller turned to him. "Mr. Hall, I apologize for putting you through this. The complaint has been dismissed and removed from any records. If you need time off or would like to speak with a counselor, those resources are available."
"Thank you," Jay said automatically.
"Mr. Hagen, if you have nothing to add, I'll file my report."
"I have nothing to add. Thank you for your swift response."
Ms. Miller left. The conference room fell silent. Jay stared at the table. His hands were still shaking.
"Jay."
He looked up. Ian's expression was calm, but his eyes were furious.
"Are you alright?"
"Yes."
"You don't look alright."
"I'm fine. It's resolved."
"That doesn't mean you're fine."
Jay's throat was tight. "I will be."
"I'm taking you home."
"That's not necessary—"
"Yes, it is. Get your things."
Jay didn't have the strength to argue. He collected his bag from his desk, ignoring the concerned looks from his colleagues. 
Ian drove in silence. When they reached Jay's building, he parked and turned off the engine.
"Do you want me to come up?"
"No. Thank you. I just need to rest."
"Call me if you need anything."
"I will."
Jay went inside. He dropped his bag by the door and sat on the couch, staring at nothing.
It was resolved. Gal was gone. The legal team would handle the rest. But his hands wouldn't stop shaking.
He'd recommended her for the position. He'd been the one to tell Ian she was promising. And she'd tried to destroy him.
His phone rang at seven. It was Leo.
"I'm outside. Let me in."
"I'm fine—"
"Let me in."
"You’re the last person I want to see right now."
"No one in this company has as much experience with failed hires as I do, so I figured I’m the best man to share the current pain with."
Jay sighed and buzzed him up. Leo arrived with a bag of takeout  and a determined expression.
"You're eating dinner," Leo announced.
"I'm not hungry."
"You're eating anyway."
He unpacked containers of food and set them on the table. 
"Ian told me what happened," Leo said.
"It's resolved."
"That doesn't make it less awful."
Jay said nothing.
Leo sat back. "This isn't the first time something like this has happened at the company. We've had similar incidents over the years. One was particularly bad. Do you want to hear about it?"
"Why would I want to hear about it?"
"Because sometimes it helps to know you're not alone."
"Fine."
Leo told him about a junior analyst who'd falsified reports, blamed a senior colleague, and tried to blackmail their way into a promotion. About a secretary who'd stolen proprietary information and claimed harassment when caught. About an intern who'd vandalized equipment and accused a manager of creating a hostile work environment.
"People do terrible things when they're desperate or entitled or both. It's not your fault for not seeing it coming."
"I recommended her."
"You recommended someone who interviewed well and seemed competent. How were you supposed to know she'd turn out like this?"
"I should have—"
"Jay. Stop."
Jay looked at him.
"Something similar happened to Ian. Years ago, when he was newer to the company. A coworker accused him of inappropriate conduct."
Jay went still. "What?"
"We didn't have as many cameras back then. It turned into a nasty legal battle. Took months to resolve."
"What happened?"
"Eventually we found enough evidence to disprove the claims. But it was brutal. Depositions, interviews, the whole thing dragged through the mud."
"How did Ian handle it?"
"He was stoic. Unruffled, at least on the surface. But this was shortly after his scandal. I think he just expected people to be scum. Like it was confirmation of what he already believed about the world."
"That's horrible."
"It is. But it's also why we installed cameras everywhere after that. Why we have strict protocols. So this kind of thing gets shut down immediately instead of dragging on."
"So I got lucky."
"You got protected by systems we built specifically to protect people."
"Is Ian alright? This must have brought back bad memories."
"He's more concerned about you than himself."
Jay picked at his food. His appetite was still gone, but he forced himself to eat.
Leo stayed for another hour, telling ridiculous stories about past company disasters until Jay almost smiled despite everything.
"Thank you. For coming over."
"Anytime. And Jay? Take tomorrow off. Don't argue."
When Leo finally left, Jay felt marginally better.
He did take Friday off. He spent the day in his apartment, alternating between restless pacing and sitting motionless on the couch.
His mind kept returning to the same thoughts in circles.
He'd recommended Gal, and she'd tried to ruin him. What did that say about his judgment? 
By Saturday, the spiraling thoughts had calmed down.
This was just another ordeal to endure if he wanted to stay where he was. And he did want to stay.
He wanted to stay by Ian's side. More than he wanted safety or certainty or freedom from complications. No matter how difficult it became. No matter what he had to endure.
That resolve gave him strength.
Scene 5
Even if it hurts
Jay went to the gym on Saturday morning. Rus was there, as always, cheerful and loud.
"How was the rest of your birthday weekend?"
"Fine."
"Your family get home safe?"
"Yeah."
"You alright?"
"Just tired. Long week."
It wasn't exactly a lie. The situation with Gal felt too raw to discuss, too complicated to explain, too close to things he'd spent years trying to forget. Rus seemed to sense this and didn't push. They worked out, then parted ways with plans to meet again next week.
Jay spent the rest of the weekend at home. Cleaning. Reading. Sitting on the balcony and watching the river. Preparing himself mentally for Monday. Monday morning was warm and sunny. Jay dressed in his best office suit. He needed the armour today.
He arrived at his desk and started working. Everything felt normal on the surface. Inside, he was a mess. His facade was paper thin. At ten, Zoe stopped by his desk.
"For what it's worth, everyone knows what actually happened. You're not under suspicion."
"That's good."
"And we've all dealt with problem hires before. It's not your fault."
Jay nodded. Zoe squeezed his shoulder and left.
At lunch, Max sat down across from him.
"When I was your age, I recommended someone for a position. They lasted three weeks before getting caught stealing equipment. I felt terrible about it for months."
"What did you do?"
"Eventually accepted that I'd made the best decision I could with the information I had. That's all anyone can do."
Their support helped. But it didn't erase the underlying guilt or the uncomfortable feeling that Jay had caused this entire situation.
Ian sat in his office and watched Jay through the glass wall.
Jay was working. Typing, reviewing documents, responding to messages. But his shoulders were tense, like he was holding himself together through sheer willpower.
Ian felt fury at himself. He should have fired Gal immediately after the quarterly party incident. He'd delayed, wanting to minimize disruption, wanting to avoid making Jay feel guilty before his family's visit. And that delay had resulted in this.
Jay had been cornered. Subjected to an HR investigation. All because Ian had made a calculated decision to wait.
The cameras had resolved it quickly, but the damage was done. Jay had experienced that moment of terror, that feeling of being falsely accused with no way to defend himself. Ian knew that feeling intimately. It left scars. He'd caused this. His choice. His failure to act decisively.
Ian stood and walked to Jay's desk. Jay looked up.
"Do you have a moment?"
"Of course."
They went to Ian's office. Ian closed the door and gestured to the chair. Jay sat.
"I wanted to check in. Make sure you're managing alright."
"I'm fine."
"Jay."
"Really. It's resolved. Everyone's been supportive. I'm handling it."
Jay's smile was brittle. Everything about him screamed that he was not fine, but Ian didn't want to push. He didn't want to make it worse by forcing a conversation Jay clearly wasn't ready for.
"If you need anything. Time off, adjusted responsibilities, anything at all. Tell me."
"I will. Thank you."
"I mean it."
"I know."
They returned to work, but Ian couldn't stop worrying.
Tuesday was worse. Jay's facade was crumbling. He stared at his screen without typing. Wednesday was the same. Ian couldn't stand it anymore.
He waited until the end of the workday. He watched Jay leave the office and gave him thirty minutes to get home, then he followed.
He knew it was crossing a line. Showing up uninvited at Jay's apartment was not something a boss did for an employee. But he couldn't just stand by and watch Jay spiral.
Jay opened the door looking surprised. 
"Ian. Is something wrong?"
"Can I come in?"
"Of course."
Ian stepped inside. The apartment was tidy, as always.
"I was worried," Ian said.
"I'm fine."
"You're not."
"I will be."
"Jay. Please. Talk to me."
They sat on the couch. Jay pulled his knees up, wrapping his arms around them.
Ian was terrified that Jay was thinking about leaving again. That this incident had been the final straw. That Ian was about to lose him.
"I keep thinking about how I recommended her. How I thought she'd be good for the team."
"You couldn't have known."
"But I should have seen something."
"There was nothing to see. She interviewed well. She performed adequately for weeks. Then she made terrible choices. That's not your failure."
Jay didn't respond. He looked small and miserable. Ian wanted to take away Jay's pain, to make everything better.
"When Leo first started hiring assistants for me, most of them were disasters. One tried to seduce me within the first week. Another stole files and sold them to a competitor. Another spread rumors that I was having affairs with half the executive team."
Jay looked up. "Really?"
"Really. Leo thought it was hilarious. I thought it was a nightmare. But it taught me something. People are complicated. Sometimes they interview well and perform terribly. Sometimes they seem harmless and turn out to be dangerous. You can't predict it. You can only respond when it becomes clear."
"I thought Gal was just awkward."
"So did I. That's why I didn't act sooner. I underestimated the danger because she seemed so uncertain and unthreatening. That was my mistake, not yours. I'm sorry this happened to you. I'm sorry I didn't prevent it."
"It's not your fault."
"It is. I should have removed her immediately after the party incident. I chose to wait and that choice led to this."
"You were trying to be fair."
"I was trying to avoid disruption. And in doing so, I created worse disruption."
Ian wanted to understand what Jay was thinking. He wanted to ask if he was planning to leave. 
Instead he said, "It will get better. The gossip will fade. The memory will become just another unpleasant incident that happened and was resolved."
Jay's eyes were bright with unshed tears. "Thank you."
Ian stood to leave. He'd crossed a line by coming here uninvited, but he couldn't regret it. Not when Jay looked like he was drowning.
At the door, Ian turned back. Jay was looking so profoundly sad that Ian couldn't stop himself. He closed the distance and pulled Jay into a hug.
Jay went still for a heartbeat. Then he clung back desperately, his arms wrapping tight around Ian's waist, his face pressed against Ian's shoulder.
Ian held him like something precious and fragile. Jay's breathing was uneven. They stood like that for a long time, neither speaking, just holding on. When they finally separated, Jay's cheeks were flushed.
"Do you remember, back in the winter, we planned that outing, but it got cancelled because of the client meeting," Jay asked.
"I remember."
"Can we still do that? Someday?"
"Yes. Whenever you want."
Jay nodded. He looked like he wanted to say something else but couldn't find the words.
Ian wanted to stay. He wanted to pull Jay back into his arms and never let go. But he also knew that would be risking too much.
"I'll see you tomorrow," Ian said.
"Tomorrow."
Ian left. The door closed behind him. He stood in the hallway, leaning against the wall beside Jay's door. Inside, Jay leaned against the same wall. Both of them separated by mere centimetres. Both longing for the other. Both battling that longing.
Ian was terrified. Jay's request had sounded desperate, like a farewell, like someone trying to capture one last good memory before leaving. Ian couldn't bear the thought of losing him. He would fight for this. Make things better. Make sure Jay wanted to stay.
Jay was simply tired. Tired of wanting something he believed he could never have. But also determined to stay. To collect these sweet moments, these brief touches. Even if it hurt. Even if it was hopeless.
Jay slid down the wall and sat on the floor. The warmth of that embrace still lingered on his skin. He wanted more. He wanted everything.
But he would take what he could have. And he would be grateful for it.
