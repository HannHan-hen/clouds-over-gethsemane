Chapter 37: Thunderstorm
Scene 1
Pine woods
Ian arrived at Jay's building at exactly seven. He used his emergency key to access the entrance and parked in the underground garage. Jay was waiting by the elevator with his large suitcase.
"Good morning," Ian said.
"Morning. Thank you for this."
They loaded the suitcase into Ian's trunk and drove to the office together. The streets were quiet this early, the city still waking. Ian glanced at Jay in the passenger seat. He offered to pick Jay up the previous afternoon, and Jay had accepted without hesitation, without the anxious overthinking that used to come with such suggestions in the past. This was exactly what Ian had hoped for. Slowly and seamlessly blending their lives together
Late May remained chilly. The year continued to be rather cold. But for Ian, the spring was unusually beautiful this year.
The workday passed quickly. Everyone rushed to finish their tasks before the four o'clock departure. The office filled with luggage as people brought their bags in throughout the morning. Ela arrived with three suitcases, causing widespread amusement.
"Are you moving there permanently?" Luc asked.
"I need options," Ela said defensively.
At four everyone abandoned their desks and grabbed their bags. Kim carried his own suitcase and one of Ela's, but she still struggled with the remaining two. Everyone else was too loaded to help.
Ian had two massive suitcases. Jay managed his single suitcase and laptop bag. Zoe had one large bag and tried to help Ela, but couldn't manage both.
They were trying to reorganize when Ray picked up Ela's wandering suitcase and headed for the elevator. Everyone stared after him. Ray followed them to the waiting buses, set down the suitcase, and left without looking back.
Jay smiled to himself. Gruff but not unkind. Just as Ian had said.
The buses were different from last year. Only two instead of four, but these were brand new luxury coaches. Wood paneling, reclining armchairs, individual screens and climate controls. Definitely an upgrade. Jay felt secretly delighted. He'd get to sit next to Ian for six hours.
Staff loaded their luggage while everyone boarded. Jay claimed a seat next to Ian, who immediately offered him the window.
"You'll want to see the scenery," Ian said.
"Thank you."
The armchairs were enormous and comfortable. Individual separators gave each seat privacy. Jay immediately started pressing buttons, adjusting his seat up and down, testing the heating and air conditioning. He was still amazed by such displays of wealth.
Ian watched him with amusement. "Comfortable?"
"Very. This is incredible."
The bus departed with minimal delay. Outside, the sky was gray and threatening. Everyone had checked weather forecasts obsessively all week, but predictions kept changing. Current forecasts showed possible storms tomorrow.
Zoe leaned across the aisle. "I hope the weather clears."
"We'll have fun regardless," Amy said.
The drive would last six hours with a dinner stop at the halfway point. Jay turned to the window, watching the city give way to countryside. Bus staff dispensed refreshments. Coffee, tea, pastries. Jay accepted coffee.
"Have you spent much time in the mountains?" he asked Ian.
"Some. My family had a ski lodge when I was young."
"You mentioned skiing once before."
"We went every winter. A family tradition."
"Were you good at it?"
"Competent. My father insisted we all learn properly. He hired instructors every year."
"Did you enjoy it?"
"I did. It was one of the few times I felt truly free. Just the mountain and the speed. No expectations or protocols. We'd spend mornings on the slopes and afternoons by the fire."
"That sounds wonderful."
"It was. I haven't been back since I was eighteen."
Jay understood what he wasn't saying. Since he was disowned. Since his family cut him off and took everything away.
"Would you want to go back?" Jay asked.
"Perhaps. Someday. Have you ever been to the mountains?"
"No. I grew up in the south, but we never traveled much."
"You would have liked it. The air is different there."
"Maybe we could go sometime."
The words came out before Jay could stop them. He felt heat rise to his face, but Ian's expression didn't change.
"I'd like that," Ian said simply.
Jay asked more questions and Ian answered, describing the lodge, the slopes, the instructors who'd taught him. Despite the bus being full, the sound management was excellent. Everyone existed in their own small cocoon of space.
They talked the whole journey. Jay felt relieved that his strange thoughts from earlier in the week weren't making things awkward. This felt as good as always, sitting and talking with Ian, sharing stories and observations.
After three hours they reached the midpoint stop. A secluded restaurant built in traditional regional style, rustic but clearly expensive. Everyone was glad to stretch despite the comfortable bus.
The feast was impressive. Long wooden tables, huge portions of traditional food. Beer in enormous mugs, platters of ribs and game, roasted vegetables, fresh bread. Everyone ate and drank and relaxed into the evening.
Jay sat next to Ian with Luc on his other side. The beer was strong and the food was rich. Luc told increasingly absurd stories about previous company events. Everyone laughed.
The feast dragged on for over an hour. When they finally returned to the bus, Jay was exhausted. He reclined his seat fully. The motion of the bus was soothing and his eyes drifted shut. He woke briefly when the bus slowed, but couldn't make himself sit up. Sleep pulled him back under.
Ian watched Jay sleep beside him, fighting the urge to smooth the black hair that had fallen across his forehead. Jay looked peaceful, his face relaxed and soft. Beautiful.
They arrived at ten. Darkness had fallen completely, and light rain misted the windows. Thunder rumbled in the distance.
"Jay. We've arrived."
Jay woke up disoriented. "Already?"
"You slept for over two hours."
"Oh."
The resort was gorgeous. Modern buildings constructed from stone and dark wood, huge glass walls revealing warm interiors. Lights hung from trees, illuminating stone paths. Through the mist, they could see the lake rippling with rain.
They gathered their things and filed off the bus. Resort staff unloaded luggage. An elegant woman in a dark uniform handed out envelopes containing keys and guidebooks.
"Welcome to Pinewood Resort. Each department has a private lodge. Please follow the marked paths. If you need anything, the main building is always staffed."
She led them along a stone path to their lodge. 
"Your team has the entire Oakwood Lodge. The main floor has a common area with a fireplace, and there's a small kitchen if you need anything. Your rooms are upstairs. Breakfast is served in the main dining hall starting at seven."
Everyone claimed their rooms quickly. Ela and Kim took the largest room together, no longer bothering with pretence. 
Luc disappeared up a narrow spiral staircase at the back. "There's an attic room up here!"
Amy chose a spacious room with a balcony. Max and Zoe selected small rooms with lake views.
Jay and Ian took rooms next to each other facing the woods. Jay pushed open his door and found a cosy space with a large bed, a desk, and a window seat.
"This is lovely," he said.
Ian appeared in the doorway. "Your room is identical to mine. Looks comfortable."
"I'm exhausted."
"As am I. We should rest."
"Goodnight, Ian."
"Goodnight, Jay."
They disappeared into their rooms. Jay showered quickly and fell into bed. His last thoughts before sleep were of Ian in the room next door. Just a wall between them.
The rain intensified outside, drumming against the roof and windows. But inside the lodge was warm and dry, the fireplace crackling softly in the salon below.
Jay pulled the blanket up to his chin and smiled in the darkness. Three days here. Three days of activities and meals and conversations. Three days near Ian. He couldn't wait until morning.
Scene 2
Fragrance
Jay woke to the sound of heavy rain against his window. He checked his phone. Quarter past six. The weather forecast showed a storm incoming, expected to last most of the day.
He dressed in casual clothes and descended the stairs. The salon was quiet except for the crackling fire. Ian sat in one of the armchairs near the fireplace, tablet in hand, coffee cup on the side table.
"Good morning," Jay said.
Ian looked up. "Morning. Did you sleep well?"
"Very well. You're up early."
"Habit. Coffee's fresh if you want some."
Jay poured himself a cup from the pot on the counter and joined Ian by the fire. The warmth was welcome after the cool upstairs hallway.
"The weather is terrible," Jay said.
"Unfortunately, yes. I was just reviewing the schedule changes. All outdoor activities are cancelled. No paddle boats, no river rafting."
"That's a shame."
"Were you looking forward to them?"
"A little. But I wasn't too invested."
Ian scrolled through the screen. "The alternative activities are indoor. Fashion workshops, styling sessions, a fashion show tonight followed by dinner."
Jay made a face. "Not really my preference."
"Nor mine. But there are other options. Dancing workshops, yoga, various tastings."
"What are you planning to do?"
"I haven't decided yet."
Jay took the tablet and flipped through the digital pamphlet. Most of the fashion activities didn't appeal to him at all. He kept scrolling until something caught his attention.
"There's a scent workshop," he said, pausing on that entry.
"In the fashion corner, yes."
"I've always wanted to learn more about that."
Ian raised an eyebrow. "Really?"
"So I won't end up smelling like an overzealous teenager on their first date during some important occasion. I'm never sure what's appropriate."
Ian looked slightly surprised, but only for a moment. That was on point for Jay, worrying about violating subtle social norms he was unfamiliar with.
"Is that strange?" Jay asked sheepishly.
"Not at all. I'll join you."
Jay felt a surge of delight. "Really?"
"If you don't mind the company."
"Of course not. I'd like that."
They sat together watching the rain fall on the lake through the glass wall. The water was gray and choppy, the trees beyond swaying in the wind. It was beautiful in its own way.
Slowly other team members started descending from their rooms. Zoe appeared first, took one look at the weather, and groaned.
"This is terrible."
"Good morning to you too," Jay said.
"I wanted to do the hiking trail today. It's supposed to be spectacular."
"Maybe tomorrow," Ian said.
"Maybe." She poured herself coffee and collapsed into an armchair. "This is so disappointing."
The others trickled down over the next hour. Max arrived looking fresh. Amy appeared perfectly composed. Luc stumbled down at half past seven, clearly not a morning person. Ela and Kim were the last to emerge, just before eight.
"Still raining," Ela observed.
"All day according to the forecast," Kim added.
"Well, at least there are indoor activities."
Everyone gathered around the fire with their coffee, discussing options. 
"Well. No point in waiting for it to clear. Let's get breakfast," Luc said.
The resort had provided rain capes in a basket by the door. Everyone grabbed one and an umbrella from the stand. They made a soggy procession along the stone path to the main building, hunched against the wind.
The breakfast hall was still pretty empty. They loaded their plates with eggs and pastries and fresh fruit, then claimed a large table near the windows.
"Remember last year?" Luc said. "That beautiful seaside weather?"
"Uncommonly warm for the season," Amy agreed.
"Our weather luck ran out," Max said cheerfully.
Zoe just ate her eggs and continued looking miserable.
Eventually conversation turned to activities. Ela was determined to do everything fashion-related.
"All of it?" Kim asked.
"Every single workshop if possible. The styling, the makeup, the photo shoot, the show."
"I want nothing to do with any of that."
"You're not even a little curious?"
"Not even slightly."
They stared at each other. It was clear they weren't thrilled about separating. Originally everyone wanted water activities in the morning, then split up afterwards. But now everything had changed.
"I'll do all the fashion things. I don't mind," Amy said.
Ela brightened. "Really? Thank you."
Kim relaxed visibly. "What are the rest of you doing?"
"Modern dance workshop," Luc said immediately. 
"Disco music. Music from my youth," Max said.
"You're not that old," Luc said.
"I'm old enough to remember when disco was current. That makes me ancient."
"I like the retro vibe. I'll join you," Kim said. 
"Me too. Jumping around is better than moping about the rain," Zoe said without enthusiasm.
"What about you two?" Luc asked Jay and Ian.
"Scent workshop," Jay said.
"That sounds very sophisticated."
"It's practical," Jay insisted.
"Sure it is."
They finished breakfast and headed toward their various activities. Ela and Amy went toward the fashion corner, already discussing dress options. Kim, Luc, Zoe, and Max headed for the dance studio.
Jay and Ian followed the fashion corridor but turned into a smaller room labeled Scent Workshop. It was elegant and intimate, with white counters and rows of glass bottles. A pleasant older woman greeted them warmly.
"Welcome, welcome. First time exploring fragrance?"
"Yes," Jay admitted.
"Wonderful. Let me show you the basics."
She led them to a counter covered in bottles. "These are the building blocks. Top notes, heart notes, base notes. Each category serves a purpose."
She explained the theory while Jay listened intently. Ian already knew most of this but remained attentive, occasionally asking questions that drew out more detailed information.
"Now, let's explore what appeals to you," she said.
"I've always been curious about your scent. It's very distinctive," Jay admitted to Ian. 
"It's called Ambre du Solstice."
Jay repeated the name in his head several times to remember. "I've always been impressed by how rich and deep it is. But not overwhelming. Just warm."
"What do you prefer?" the woman asked Jay.
"Lighter, more fresh scents."
"Let's try some options."
She guided Jay through various scents. Mint and lemon and lavender and cedar. He smelled each, testing combinations, asking questions about composition.
"These are lovely," he said, holding up a mint and cedar combination.
"Very clean. Versatile for any occasion."
"Could I mix something similar?"
"Absolutely. Here, try this."
She set out several bottles and guided him through creating his own blend. Ian watched, giving occasional suggestions. They adjusted ratios, testing results.
"This is perfect," Jay said finally, smelling the result on his wrist.
"Let me try," Ian said.
Jay held out his wrist. Ian took his hand and brought it closer, inhaling deeply.
"Yes, that suits you very well."
Jay's heart was racing as he pulled his hand back.
"Now let's create something together. A shared scent, if you'd like."
"Together?" Jay asked.
"Why not? It's a lovely memento of your time here."
Jay looked at Ian. "Would you want to?"
"Yes."
They worked on it together, combining elements from both their preferences. The warm depth of Ian's choice with the fresh brightness Jay favoured. It took several attempts to balance properly.
"That's beautiful. Rich but fresh. Perfectly balanced."
Jay smelled it and grinned. It warm and clean and somehow exactly right.
"We'll take two bottles," Ian said.
She prepared them while Jay kept smelling his wrist. They had their own fragrance now. Something that belonged to both of them.
They left the workshop with their bottles. Jay was absolutely delighted, unable to stop smiling.
"That was wonderful," he said.
"I'm glad you enjoyed it."
"Did you?"
"Very much."
They went to a tea ceremony next to refresh themselves after all the smelling. The room was empty except for a young woman in traditional dress who welcomed them and guided them to cushions on the floor. She prepared tea with graceful movements. The ceremony was meditative, focusing on each small action. She served them in tiny cups, the tea fragrant and delicate.
The rain kept hitting the lake surface beyond the windows, creating rippling patterns. The room was warm and serene.
"We smell like a perfumery," Jay whispered.
Ian's mouth twitched. "Probably."
Jay kept smelling his wrist between sips, grinning each time. The scent was divine. When the ceremony concluded, the woman bowed and departed, leaving them alone in the room.
"Should we head back?" Ian asked eventually.
"I suppose we should."
They stood and made their way to the dining hall for lunch. The rest of the team was already there. Ela and Amy were dressed extravagantly in long, elaborate dresses with heavy makeup. The others wore sports clothes and were breathing heavily.
"How was dancing?" Jay asked.
"Exhausting. I'm too old for this," Max said.
"You kept up fine," Luc said.
"I'll be sore tomorrow."
"Worth it though. That was actually fun," Kim added.
They loaded their plates with herbal meat pies and cured meats. The food was good, regional and warming. Jay liked it well enough, though last year's tropical grilled skewers had been phenomenal.
He looked around the venue as he ate. The glass ceiling and walls gave an amazing view of the surrounding area, but the overcast skies and rain made it look vaguely foreboding. Thankfully the food and jovial atmosphere mitigated the unfriendly aura outside.
Soon everyone finished eating and departed to prepare for their afternoon activities. Jay and Ian walked back through the rain to their lodge, umbrellas barely keeping them dry. Inside, the fire was still burning. They stood near it, drying off.
Jay smelled his wrist again. He couldn't stop smiling.
Scene 3
Fashion
Jay and Ian grabbed their evening clothes from the lodge and returned to the main building. Better to change there than risk getting their formal wear wet walking back and forth. The fashion area included numerous changing rooms and styling stations. Staff moved between them with clothes and accessories. Music played in the background.
Jay went to the changing room to get dressed. His blue three-piece suit fit perfectly. He fastened the sapphire cufflinks Ian had given him, then the matching tiepin. The effect was striking. He looked like a prince.
Jay stepped out and found Ian waiting, dressed in a slate gray three-piece suit. They had both applied their shared scent. Jay caught the fragrance as Ian approached and smiled.
"You look excellent," Ian said.
"So do you."
They moved toward the styling area. The rest of their team was scattered throughout, in various states of preparation. Some were still arriving. Others were already fully dressed and posing for photographers.
A stylist approached Jay immediately. She looked him up and down with an approving expression.
"Perfect. Absolutely perfect. We'll just need some minor hair adjustments."
"Thank you."
She gestured to a hairdresser. "Take him to station three. Classic style."
Before Jay could respond, two other stylists descended on Ian.
"No, no, no. You absolutely cannot show up to the party looking like this."
"I beg your pardon?" Ian said.
"Trust us. We have a vision."
They whisked Ian away before he could protest. Jay watched him disappear into a private styling room, looking resigned. He suppressed a smile as he allowed himself to be led to the hairdresser.
The process took less than twenty minutes. The hairdresser worked efficiently, creating an old-fashioned style that made Jay look distinguished. When she finished, he thanked her and wandered back into the main area.
Luc appeared at one point looking like a movie star from a spy film. Perfectly tailored tuxedo, slicked-back hair, an air of dangerous charm.
"How do I look?" he asked, striking a pose.
"Like you're about to order a martini," Jay said.
Kim and Ela emerged together, both wearing opulent outfits with elaborate accessories. Their ensembles matched, coordinated in deep burgundy and gold.
"You two look incredible," Jay said.
"We know," Ela replied happily.
Amy wore a long flowing dress with sparkling diamond jewellery. She looked timeless, like she'd stepped out of a classic film. Zoe eventually appeared in extremely high heels and a short seductive dress, looking quite amused by the result.
"These shoes are death traps," she said.
"You look amazing though," Jay replied.
"I know. It's worth the pain."
Max arrived dressed like old royalty, all velvet and brocade. He looked both magnificent and slightly ridiculous.
"Don't say a word," Max warned.
Jay grinned. "You look very refined."
"I look like I'm attending a coronation."
"That too."
Jay kept glancing toward the private styling room where Ian had disappeared. Nearly two hours had passed. What were they doing to him?
Finally, the door opened.
Ian emerged, and Jay forgot how to breathe.
The outfit was completely unlike anything Ian would ever choose. A top that was far too tight, showing every line of his athletic build. An asymmetrical jacket draped over one shoulder. A long scarf in bold colours draped loosely around his neck. Skintight pants that left absolutely nothing to the imagination. Tall boots that added another few centimetres to his already imposing height.
It had no right to look as good as it did. But Ian's natural musculature and perfect proportions somehow made it work. He moved with complete confidence, as if he wore this sort of thing every day.
"Well?" Ian asked, approaching Jay.
"You look incredible."
"This is definitely not what I would have picked myself."
"But it works."
"Does it?"
"Yes."
Leo appeared from somewhere, wearing what looked like several furs stitched together with gold chains in bizarre places. He took one look at Ian and burst out laughing.
"Oh, this is perfect. Absolutely perfect."
"You really have no right to laugh at anyone, looking like you robbed several grandmas and stole their prized foxes from before the war."
"These are vintage pieces."
"They're ridiculous."
"So are those pants."
"At least I look good."
Leo grinned. "You do. I hate to admit it, but you do."
The staff began herding everyone toward where the fashion show would take place. Jay walked beside Ian, very aware of how different they looked. His own classic suit contrasted sharply with Ian's avant-garde outfit. They filed into a large hall with rows of seating facing a raised runway. Jay sat next to Ian.
The show began with dramatic music and lasted maybe two hours. The host presented collections from designers Jay had never heard of. Models walked the runway in elaborate creations, some beautiful, some bizarre. Ela nodded knowingly every now and then, discussing something animatedly with Amy in hushed voices. Jay had no idea what was happening, but at the very least most of the outfits looked presentable.
When the show finally ended, staff directed everyone to a photography area, where photographers had set up backdrops and lighting.
"Individual shots first," someone announced. "Then groups."
Jay posed awkwardly, unsure what to do with his hands. The photographer gave him direction and he did his best to follow. The results, when shown on the screen, were surprisingly good.
Ela and Amy were absolutely delighted with their photos. Kim looked pleased. Even Zoe couldn't complain, holding an old-fashioned cigarette pipe and pretending to smoke like the fancy socialites from the prewar era.
The group photos were chaotic but fun. Their entire team crowded together, then individual departments, then random combinations. Jay ended up with a folder full of images by the time they finished.
"These are fantastic," Ela said, flipping through hers.
"Very glamorous," Amy agreed.
By the time they were done, evening had fully arrived. Staff directed them toward the dinner hall.
The space was enormous. Glass walls and ceiling stretched overhead. Lights floated in midair, suspended by invisible wires. The storm had intensified. Lightning illuminated the sky in dramatic flashes, visible through the transparent roof. Thunder rolled constantly, deep and ominous.
The theme was old time cinema. Everyone remained in their glamorous outfits. Staff circulated with trays of champagne, caviar, lobster. A live band played vintage music in the corner.
It was completely different from last year's refined elegance. This was playful and dramatic, enhanced by the violent weather outside.
Jay grabbed a glass of champagne and wandered between tables. People laughed and showed each other photos from earlier. Some danced to the band's music.
Jay kept looking for Ian. Every time he spotted him across the room, his heart skipped a beat. Ian looked so different in that outfit, but he owned it completely. He could have been a model with how naturally he presented himself. Jay knew he was staring. He tried to be discreet and failed completely.
The evening progressed through multiple courses. More champagne appeared. The band played faster songs and more people danced. Lightning continued to flash overhead, adding to the atmosphere.
Finally, late in the evening, Jay found Ian in a relatively secluded corner. The party was still going strong, but this section was quieter.
"Are you enjoying yourself?" Ian asked.
"Very much." Jay moved closer, catching their shared scent on Ian. He smiled. "You look great."
"Thank you. Though I have to say, this outfit is excruciatingly uncomfortable."
"Really?"
"The pants are far too tight. And I'm fairly certain the boots have given me a blister."
Jay laughed. "We could excuse ourselves. It's already after dessert. There really isn't any reason to stick around. I can pretend to be super drunk and you can escort me again."
"That's a brilliant idea."
They approached their team's table. Ian put a hand on Jay's shoulder.
"I'm taking Jay back to the lodge. He's had enough to drink."
"Already?" Luc asked.
"And I need to get off these pants as soon as possible," Ian added.
Everyone laughed. Ela waved them off.
"Go, go. We'll see you tomorrow."
They grabbed coats and umbrellas at the entrance, but the rainfall was absolutely insane. Even with protection, they were quite wet by the time they reached their lodge.
Jay undressed in his room, hanging his suit properly so it would dry without damage. He heard Ian moving around next door, presumably removing his cursed fashion outfit with much less care.
They both showered and changed into pyjamas, then reconvened in the living room. The fireplace still burned warmly. Ian retrieved a bottle of wine from somewhere and two glasses.
"To commemorate our successful fashion debut," he said.
Jay laughed and accepted a glass. They sat together on the sofa, close enough that Jay could still catch hints of their shared scent. Outside, the storm raged violently. Wind howled. Rain hammered the windows. Thunder shook the building. Inside, everything was warm and comfortable.
"It's not fair," Ian said after his first sip of wine.
"What isn't?"
"I had to dress up as a clown while you were left alone looking dignified."
Jay grinned. "It was definitely Leo's doing."
"Obviously."
"I can't believe you stay friends with someone who clearly wishes you ill."
"He doesn't wish me ill. He just enjoys chaos."
"Same thing."
"He wasn't always like this. When we were in college together, he was quite different."
"Really?"
"He was younger, in an earlier year. Quite awkward. Our families knew each other, so I took him under my wing. I mentored him through the social aspects of university life."
Jay tried to imagine Leo as an awkward teenager and failed. "I can't picture that at all."
"He was very earnest. Tried too hard to fit in. Made terrible jokes that nobody laughed at."
"And now you're stuck with him."
"I am. Though I admit, life is rarely boring with Leo around."
Jay sipped his wine, watching the fire. "I always thought rich people were naturally worldly and polished. That they never had awkward phases."
"Everyone has awkward phases. Wealth doesn't prevent that."
"I suppose not."
They talked until almost one in the morning, about the day's activities, the ridiculous fashion show, the photos they'd taken. Ian told more stories about Leo's college years, each one more absurd than the last. Jay shared memories from his own university days, the dormitories and terrible cafeteria food.
The wine disappeared slowly. The fire burned down to embers. Outside, the storm continued its assault. Finally, reluctantly, they got up.
"We should sleep," Ian said.
"Probably."
They walked upstairs together. At their adjacent doors, they paused.
"Today was wonderful," Jay said.
"It was. Sleep well."
"You too."
Jay entered his room and got into bed. Late-night talks with Ian over drinks were definitely the best thing in the world.
Scene 4
The Green Fairy
Jay's alarm went off at six thirty. He'd only managed about five hours of sleep, but he silenced it immediately and got out of bed. He wouldn't miss morning coffee with Ian for anything. He dressed in casual jeans and a comfortable shirt, then headed downstairs. Ian was already there. A fresh pot of coffee sat on the side table.
"Good morning," Ian said.
"Morning." Jay poured himself a cup and joined Ian on the sofa. "Do you always wake up this early?"
"I wake at five thirty most days."
"Every day?"
"I normally sleep six hours, but I can function on four if necessary. At least for a few days."
"I've never been good with little sleep."
"It's something I've always done. Even when I was younger."
Jay sipped his coffee, waiting for the caffeine to work its magic. Five hours definitely wasn't enough for him, but this serene rainy morning with Ian, before the chaos of the day began, was worth the sacrifice.
Slowly, the rest of the team came down. Each one looked worse for wear after yesterday's partying. Zoe looked absolutely miserable. "It's still raining."
"Maybe it'll clear later," Max said.
"It's not going to clear. This whole retreat is ruined."
"We're making the best of it."
"I wanted to do the trail hike."
"I know."
Luc dropped onto the sofa with a heavy sigh. "The horseback archery is cancelled too. I checked the schedule."
"How can you even think about archery right now? My head is killing me," Ela asked.
"I'm resilient."
They eventually rallied enough to make the walk to breakfast. The rain was lighter than yesterday, and they arrived mostly dry. The breakfast hall was busy. Jay loaded his plate and found a seat. The food helped, though he still felt tired.
After breakfast, Leo appeared and announced a grand cook off.
"Originally an outdoor party was supposed to happen in a charming grove. With team sports. But that's cancelled. Instead, each department sends a team of four to prepare lunch dishes."
Murmurs spread through the hall.
"You'll have access to our kitchens and ingredients. The winning team receives a mystery prize!"
Leo looked positively gleeful. Ian immediately looked suspicious.
"I'm volunteering," Luc said instantly.
Jay remembered the absolutely awful breakfast Luc had once prepared him. "Can you even cook? Because it didn't seem that way."
"Not at all. I never cook. But I like a challenge."
"That's a terrible reason to volunteer."
Amy shook her head. "I never cook either. I'm definitely passing."
Kim and Ela exchanged amused looks. "We're definitely not very good."
"I have some experience. I can help," Max said.
"It's not my favourite activity, but I feed myself regularly, so I won't burn everything," Zoe added.
Ian and Jay exchanged glances. Jay grinned shamelessly. They were absolutely going to win this.
"Ian and I volunteer," Jay announced. "We need to keep the record of winning team activities."
Ian raised an eyebrow but didn't object.
Leo clapped his hands. "All teams, report to the kitchens in one hour. You'll have twenty minutes to plan your menu, then three hours to prepare at least four distinct dishes."
They made their way to the kitchen area. Multiple cooking stations had been set up, each with full equipment. Other departments were already gathering, looking various degrees of confident and terrified.
Leo stood at the front wearing an absurdly enthusiastic expression, like he'd personally won some prestigious award. Ian's suspicion deepened.
"Welcome, competitors! Your ingredient selection is over there. Plan wisely. Cooking begins at exactly eleven o'clock."
Ian immediately took charge. He did the most crucial tasks himself with absolute mastery, to everyone's great surprise. Except Jay, who just smiled and followed his orders. He didn't admit to having done this before, but he was quite confident in their cooperation.
Zoe and Max did the chopping, washing, peeling, stirring. Ian coordinated everything while frying simultaneously.
"Start the vegetable stock," Ian told Jay. "Exact measurements. I'll prep the fish."
The other teams struggled in various ways. IT was consistently the fastest to finish each dish, but their presentations were sloppy. Accounting produced surprisingly good food but nowhere near Ian's level. Legal tried very hard, but the results were subpar across the board.
Jay stirred the soup while watching Ian sear the fish. His movements were confident. This wasn't someone who occasionally cooked. This was someone with serious training.
The dishes came together beautifully. The soup was velvety. The fish was crisp on the outside, tender inside, with herb butter that elevated everything. The roasted vegetables were caramelized and sweet.
They plated everything and delivered it to the serving area. Other team members gathered to sample the various dishes.
The reactions to Ian's team were immediate and enthusiastic.
"This is restaurant quality," someone from accounting said.
Ela tried the soup and looked stunned. "Ian, this is incredible."
Kim sampled everything. "You're wasted in finance. You should open a restaurant."
Lunch that day was complete chaos, but elicited many laughs.
The final results were announced after everyone had eaten. Ian's team won by a huge margin. Their department would receive a mystery prize at the retreat's conclusion.
Ian had a very bad feeling about it.
The afternoon involved multiple concerts to choose from. Everyone went back to change into evening clothes. Jay wore his second three piece suit. He met Ian in an equally polished outfit.
"At least you don't have to suffer tight trousers this time," Jay said.
"Thank god for that."
They reviewed the afternoon schedule. Multiple concerts were available. Electronica, pop, alternative rock, and classical chamber music.
"The string quartet looks interesting," Ian said.
"You want to go to that one?"
"If you're interested."
"I am."
Most of their team departed for either the electronica or pop concerts. The classical venue was small and intimate. Plush chairs faced a small stage. Only about twelve people attended, making it the least popular option by far.
Jay and Ian found seats near the middle. The string quartet entered and took their positions. The music began immediately. It was beautiful. Serene and calming, occasionally haunting. The strings wove together in complex harmonies that filled the space.
But Jay mostly watched Ian.
Ian looked positively beaming. He sat with his eyes closed, completely absorbed in the music. His expression was tranquil, more relaxed than Jay had ever seen him. It was a beautiful sight.
The concert lasted about an hour. When it ended, Ian opened his eyes slowly, as if returning from somewhere far away.
"Did you like it?" Ian asked.
"I loved it," Jay said honestly.
The music had been pleasant enough. But it was simply a backdrop to the more heartfelt display he'd just witnessed.
Dinner was themed around global cuisine. Chefs from various southern countries presented their national dishes. The food was rich and unusual, with flavour profiles Jay had never experienced before. Some were quite bold.
Kim was absolutely delighted. "This is incredible. The organization of this event is spectacular."
Afterwards, a disco was organized. The entire team went. Jay and Ian lasted maybe fifteen minutes in the noise and lights before they fled after exchanging miserable glances. Way too loud. They didn't even excuse themselves, just escaped back to their lodge.
"That was unbearable," Jay said once they were outside.
The rain had finally stopped. The air was cold but fresh. They reached their lodge and sat on the sofa. The fireplace still burned warmly.
"There are alternative activities. Movie viewings, spa packages, board games," Ian said.
"Do you want to do any of those?"
"Not particularly."
"Would you be interested in trying something different?"
"What kind of different?"
"Come upstairs. I'll show you."
Jay followed Ian up to his room. Ian opened his suitcase and pulled out a dark green bottle along with several implements Jay didn't recognize.
"Absinthe. It was popular in certain circles during the early previous century. I acquired an authentic bottle by chance."
Jay examined the bottle. The label was old-fashioned and elaborate. "I've heard of it. Never tried it."
"We might as well try now. There's an entire drinking ritual involved."
"A ritual?"
"I'll show you."
He began preparing the drinks. First, he poured a measure of the green liquid into each glass. Then he placed the slotted spoon across the rim and set a sugar cube on top.
"Now we add cold water. Slowly, over the sugar."
He picked up a bottle and began dripping water over the cube. It dissolved gradually, the sweetened water falling into the absinthe below. The liquid began to cloud. The process was almost meditative. Ian moved through the steps like the tea ceremony they'd attended earlier. Jay watched, fascinated, then took the glass and sniffed cautiously. It smelled herbal, with undertones of anise. He took a small sip. The taste was mouth numbing and intensely medicinal. Definitely distinct.
"What do you think?" Ian asked.
"It's unusual. Strong."
Jay leaned back against the headboard, feeling the alcohol work through his system. "This feels decadent."
"That is the idea. Alcohol is a dangerous vice, but it's brilliant at creating exactly this atmosphere. Dreamy, almost mystical."
"I can feel it already."
Ian prepared another round. The water dripped slowly over the sugar cube. The liquid clouded.
"I'm glad you look better now," Ian said quietly, not looking up.
"Better?"
"Earlier this year, there was a time when I was terrified. I thought I'd pushed too hard. Pushed everyone too far. I was scared you would finally break."
"You were worried about me?"
"Very worried. I'm glad things are moving in the right direction. That this retreat is going relatively well."
Jay laughed, feeling mellow and floaty. "Yeah, it was difficult. I wanted to run away."
Ian looked up sharply. "You did?"
"A lot of little things happened at the same time. Made me doubt my place in the world. Made me believe I should return to where I belonged. A gray and unassuming existence."
"Jay..."
"When things go poorly, I spiral. I can't control it. I just sink deeply into misery. And I know things will go badly again. I'll feel miserable again. That's why I wanted to run. Because even though I know this misery will pass, it still terrifies me to go through it."
"It shouldn't be this difficult. It's my fault."
"It isn't. Things just sometimes go badly. I know I'm being ridiculous. There's no guarantee things will go well elsewhere. But somehow in this world, failures feel more monumental. Like I'm not just failing at a task, I'm proving I don't belong."
"That's not true."
"I know. Logically, I know. I have to work on it, not run away. And I'm glad I didn't, because I've never been happier."
Ian slowly prepared another round. The absinthe made everything feel soft and strange. Jay moved from the bed to sit on the floor, leaning against the side of the mattress. Ian stayed in his chair, preparing drink after drink.
"The green fairy. That's what they called it."
"Why?"
"Hallucinations. Supposedly. Though that was probably just the alcohol content."
"Are we going to hallucinate?"
"Probably not. But we're definitely getting drunk."
Jay laughed. The room became dreamlike. At some point Jay ended up sitting on the bed again, though he couldn't remember moving. 
Ian squinted at the bottle. "How much have we drunk?"
"A lot."
"We should probably stop."
But neither of them moved. Ian prepared another round. He was sloppy now, water spilling, sugar dissolving too fast. But they drank anyway.
"I'm really drunk," Jay announced.
"Me too."
Jay laughed so hard he nearly spilled his drink. Everything was hilarious. The room spun gently. Jay wasn't sure when he closed his eyes. But at some point he let himself drift. The last thing he remembered was Ian's voice saying something he couldn't quite make out, and the feeling of being exactly where he belonged.
Scene 5
Spa treatments
Jay woke to blinding pain. His head felt like it was splitting open. Every muscle ached. He opened his eyes slowly and immediately regretted it.
He was lying on a bed. Not his bed. Ian's bed. He was still fully dressed. His jacket lay crumpled on the floor beside Ian's. The empty absinthe bottle sat on the desk.
Ian lay beside him, perfectly still, eyes closed. His face was pale and drawn.
"Ian?" Jay whispered.
"Yes."
"Are you alive?"
"Debatable."
Jay tried to sit up and the room spun violently. He fell back against the pillows with a groan. "What time is it?"
Ian opened one eye and looked at his watch. "Seven thirty."
They lay there in mutual misery. Jay's head pounded with every heartbeat. He'd never had a hangover this severe. His stomach rolled dangerously. He swallowed hard, trying to keep everything down. "I'm going to die."
"You're not going to die."
"I might."
"You won't."
Ian sat up slowly, moving like everything hurt. His hair was disheveled, his shirt wrinkled. He looked as terrible as Jay felt.
"We need water," Ian said. He swung his legs over the side of the bed, got up and made his way to the bathroom. Jay heard the tap running, then Ian returned with two glasses and a bottle of painkillers. He handed one to Jay.
"Sit up slowly," Ian instructed.
Jay obeyed, moving with excruciating care. The room tilted. Ian handed him water and pills. Jay swallowed them gratefully. He looked toward the window. Bright sunshine streamed through. The sky was blue and clear. After two days of rain, it was almost offensive.
"Everyone will be hiking," Jay said.
"Probably."
"We can't go."
"Definitely not."
"What should we do?"
"The spa is available. We could spend the morning there."
"Sounds reasonable."
"We should probably get cleaned up first," Ian said.
"I should go to my room."
"Can you walk?"
"I'll manage."
Jay got up clumsily. The room tilted but he stayed upright. He retrieved his jacket from the floor and made his way to the door.
"Jay," Ian said quietly.
"Yes?"
"I'm sorry. This is my fault."
"It's not. We both made terrible decisions."
Jay returned to his room and collapsed onto the bed, his heart still pounding, not from the hangover, but from the memory of waking beside Ian. They’d spent the night together, if only because he’d been too drunk to move. And even now, aching and half-alive, he couldn’t bring himself to mind. The misery felt almost sweet for having happened in Ian’s company.
An hour later, Jay felt marginally better. He'd showered and changed into clean clothes. His head still throbbed, but less violently. He went down to the empty living room. Everyone else had already left for breakfast and activities. Ian appeared shortly after. He'd changed into slacks and a sweater.
"Ready?" Ian asked.
"As I'll ever be."
They made their way to the spa building. It was dim, with meditative music playing. The staff welcomed them and led them to a relaxation room with heated loungers. Jay lay down gratefully. The warmth seeped into his aching muscles. Someone brought them cucumber water and cool cloths for their faces.
"This was the right choice," Jay muttered.
Ian lay on the next lounger, eyes closed. Even hungover and exhausted, he looked good. Jay watched him for a moment before closing his own eyes. They were spending another morning together. Recovering from their terrible decisions, but together nonetheless.
Eventually the staff came to offer massages. Jay's massage therapist worked magic on his tense shoulders and back. By the time it ended, he felt mostly recovered. They reconvened in the relaxation room, both looking better.
"I think I might survive," Jay said.
"I believe you will."
"Should we attempt lunch?"
"We should try."
They made their way to the dining hall. Most people were already there, energetic from their outdoor activities.
"There you are! We were worried," Ela called.
"We weren't feeling well this morning," Ian said.
"Too much wine last night?"
"Something like that."
Food was laid out buffet style, but Jay stuck to plain rice and steamed vegetables. Ian chose similarly safe options. The rest of the team looked happy and refreshed. Zoe was particularly excited, having finally gotten to do her trail hike.
"It was spectacular. The views were incredible. You should have come."
"Next time," Jay said weakly.
After lunch, Leo stood and called for attention. He looked far too pleased with himself.
"As promised, we have a mystery prize for the winning cooking team!"
Ian looked deeply concerned.
"The finance department will receive an all-expenses-paid weekend trip to the thermal springs resort! Hot springs, mineral baths, mountain views. A perfect getaway."
Everyone cheered. Kim and Ela looked delighted. Even Zoe smiled.
"When is this trip?" Ian asked.
"To be scheduled at your convenience."
"That's very generous."
"Only the best for our champions. I hope you all enjoy it."
Ian looked like he suspected a trap but couldn't identify it yet.
After lunch, they returned to their lodges to pack. Jay folded his suits and organized his belongings. Everything fit back nicely into his suitcase. He stood in his room for a moment, looking around. They'd been here only three days, but it felt longer. So much had happened.
He went downstairs with his luggage. The rest of the team trickled down gradually. The buses arrived at two o'clock. Staff loaded luggage. Everyone boarded and found their seats.
Jay claimed the same spot as before, window seat with Ian beside him. The buses pulled away from the resort, beginning the long journey home.
The weather was beautiful now, bright and clear. Through the windows, Jay could see the mountains properly. They were stunning, all green forests and gray stone peaks.
"It's beautiful," Jay said.
"It is. A shame we couldn't see it earlier."
"At least we got one nice day."
The bus rolled smoothly along mountain roads. People chatted or dozed. Jay turned to look at Ian. He'd reclined his seat and closed his eyes.
Three days together. Cooking, concerts, drinking too much absinthe. Waking up in Ian's bed. Recovering in the spa side by side. Now they were going back to the city. Back to the office.
He didn't want this to end. He wanted more mornings drinking coffee before anyone else woke. More evenings talking by the fire. More moments where it was just the two of them.
Ian opened his eyes and turned to look at him. "Are you alright?"
"Yes. Just tired."
It was still bright when they finally reached the city. The buses pulled up to the office building at eight o'clock. Everyone got out, retrieving their luggage. People said their goodbyes and scattered to their cars or taxis.
"I can drive you home," Ian offered.
"That would be nice. Thank you."
They loaded Jay's luggage into Ian's car. The drive was short. Too short. They pulled up to Jay's building and Ian turned off the engine.
"Thank you for a wonderful weekend," Ian said.
"Thank you for inviting me to try the absinthe. Even if we paid for it dearly."
Jay opened the door but didn't get out. He wanted to say something more. How he'd never been happier than sitting by the fire drinking wine with Ian. How the thought of going back was unbearable. But he couldn't. It would be too much, too obvious.
"See you Monday," he said instead.
"See you Monday, Jay."
Ian retrieved Jay's suitcase from the trunk. They stood on the sidewalk, facing each other. Jay wanted to hug him. To hold on and not let go. Instead he took his suitcase and smiled.
He entered his apartment and set down his suitcase. Ian was probably entering his own apartment. So close. Just twelve minutes away. But it felt impossibly far.
