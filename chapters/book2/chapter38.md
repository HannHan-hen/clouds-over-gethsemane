Chapter 38: New faces
Scene 1
New hires
Jay arrived at the office at seven twenty. He'd been awake since five, unable to sleep. The retreat felt like a dream now. Three days where the rules had been different. Where he'd woken up beside Ian in the same bed.
He turned on his computer. The office was empty, silent. He opened his email and tried to focus on the messages that had accumulated over the weekend.
The elevator doors opened at seven thirty. Ian walked in. He stopped when he saw Jay.
"You're here early."
"I couldn't sleep."
They looked at each other. Jay wanted to say something, but the glass wall of Ian's office felt like a barrier again. The desk between them was back.
The rest of the team arrived around nine. The office filled with noise. Everyone was talking about the retreat.
"That cooking competition was incredible. Ian, you destroyed everyone. Where did you learn to make that sauce?" Luc said the moment he arrived.
"Practice."
"The fashion show was the best part," Ela said. "Ian, that outfit was absolutely wild."
"It was not my choice."
"You looked amazing though. Like some kind of avant-garde sculpture."
"You two disappeared after the disco," Ela said. "Where did you go?"
"We returned to the lodge," Jay said. "The disco was too loud."
"I heard people were still partying at three in the morning."
At the far end of the office, Ray sat at his desk with his headphones on. He hadn't acknowledged anyone. 
During the morning, Jay tried to focus but kept looking up at Ian through the glass. Ian was on the phone, then reviewing documents, then typing emails. The person who'd fallen asleep beside him on Saturday felt impossibly distant.
The afternoon was busier. The last week of May involved preparation for new hires. Ian called Jay into his office at three.
"We should review the onboarding procedures. The juniors arrive Monday morning at nine. HR will handle most of their training, but we'll need to welcome them and introduce them to the team."
"What should I prepare?"
"Nothing elaborate. A brief introduction to the department structure and the team members. HR will cover policies and systems."
"And the senior analyst?"
"Liv Moreau arrives at ten. She'll receive a personal onboarding session. I'll handle that directly."
"Should I sit in?"
"If you'd like. It might be useful for future reference."
They spent the next two hours reviewing procedures. Ian explained the timeline for integrating new hires, the typical adjustment period, the common challenges. Jay took notes and asked questions.
They worked until eight. When Jay finally left, Ian was still at his desk. Jay wanted to stay longer, to find an excuse to remain.
The apartment felt too empty when he got home. He retrieved the bottle of perfume they made and sprayed it into the air. The room filled with the fragrance they'd created together. Then he sat on the couch and closed his eyes. Three days. That was all it had been. 
The next day Jay helped Ian organize files for the new hires, reviewed their resumes again, prepared workspace assignments. They worked late that evening. The overtime felt like a gift. An excuse to be together.
On Wednesday, Jay left the office at four. He'd scheduled the final inspection of his old apartment for five, but he wanted to arrive early. To say goodbye properly.
The building looked smaller than he remembered. The lobby was dim and narrow. He climbed the stairs to the fourth floor and unlocked the door to his old studio.
It was empty. All his belongings were gone. The space looked larger without his furniture. Impersonal.
He walked to the window. The view was the same. He'd spent years looking at this view, in this tiny room with its cheap air conditioning and loud refrigerator. So many nights here. So many nights when he'd cried himself to sleep, when he'd felt worthless and broken. 
He took out a cloth and wiped down the windowsill. Dust had accumulated in the corners. He swept the floor and cleaned the kitchen counter. The apartment had served him well. It deserved a proper farewell.
The landlord's representative arrived at five.
"Everything looks good," she said after a quick inspection. "No damage, very clean. We'll return your full deposit."
They signed the contract termination papers. The whole process took fifteen minutes. She handed him the signed documents.
"Good luck with your new place."
"Thank you."
He locked the door for the last time and returned the keys. The walk to the metro felt surreal. He'd walked this route hundreds of times. Now he'd never walk it again.
By the time he reached his new apartment, the tears were already falling. He set down his bag and sat on the couch. The new place was beautiful, bright and perfectly designed. But he'd been attached to that tiny room. It had been his refuge. And now it was gone.
He cried for twenty minutes. Then he washed his face and made tea and tried to convince himself that leaving the past behind was a good thing. It didn't help much.
Thursday morning, Ian noticed immediately. Jay's eyes were red and slightly swollen. He'd tried to hide it but hadn't succeeded.
Ian waited until mid-morning, then called him into the office.
"Jay. Are you alright?"
"I'm fine."
"You don't look fine."
Jay sat down across from him. He looked exhausted. "I ended the lease yesterday, returned the keys. It was harder than I expected. I know the new apartment is better. I know I should be happy. But I was attached to the old place."
"It's not irrational. That apartment represented safety. Leaving it feels like losing something important."
"I cried when I got home. I cried some more in the morning."
"That's understandable."
Jay rubbed his face. "I feel stupid. It was just an apartment."
"It was more than that. Of course you're grieving. Take the day slowly. We're not facing any emergencies."
"I'll be fine."
The rest of the week passed quickly. Friday was spent finalizing preparations. On Monday morning, Jay arrived at seven thirty. He'd prepared a brief introduction for the juniors. Ian had reviewed it and approved.
At nine, the new hires arrived in the lobby. Jay and Ian met them there along with Sal from HR.
Rin Harris was a man in his late twenties with short brown hair and a well-cut suit. He looked nervous. His hands kept moving, adjusting his watch, smoothing his tie.
"Welcome to Turner & Associates. This is Jay Hall, my assistant. He'll be one of your primary points of contact."
"Thank you for the opportunity. I promise not to disappoint you too quickly," Rin said.
Gal Gray stood beside him. She looked exactly as she had during the interviews. Large glasses, old-fashioned bangs, modest clothing. She smiled shyly.
"We're glad to have you both. Sal will take you to the conference room now for the general onboarding session. You'll be joining mew analysts from other departments. The session will cover company policies, systems access, and administrative procedures," Jay said.
Sal led them away. Ian and Jay returned to the elevator.
"My onboarding looked different," Jay said.
"You were a special case. Leo recruited you directly and the circumstances were unusual. Normally we have a structured process."
"You handed me a stack of files and told me to read them."
"I wasn't particularly welcoming." 
"You were cautious. I understood."
They returned to the office. At ten, the elevator doors opened again. Liv Moreau stepped out.
She was beautiful. Early forties, dark hair, elegant suit, confident posture. Her smile was warm.
"Ian. It's wonderful to finally start."
Ian extended his hand. "Welcome, Liv. Thank you for joining us."
His tone was perfectly polite, but Jay noticed the strain. Ian's posture was too rigid. He was performing. It was completely different from when Ray had arrived. With Ray, Ian had seemed at ease. With Liv, he was guarded.
"This is Jay Hall, my assistant."
"A pleasure," Liv said, shaking Jay's hand. Her grip was firm. "I've heard excellent things about you."
"Thank you. Welcome to the team."
Ian led Liv into his office. Jay returned to his desk. Through the glass wall, he watched Ian conduct the onboarding session. Ian explained the department structure, current projects, reporting lines, expectations. Liv seemed relaxed, but Ian remained tense. 
At noon, the team gathered for lunch. Liv joined them happily.
"So you have three children," Luc said. "How do you manage work and family?"
"With a lot of support from my partner. We split responsibilities evenly."
"That's impressive. I can barely manage my own schedule."
"It's a matter of organization. And accepting that perfection isn't possible."
She asked about team dynamics and office culture. She listened attentively and responded thoughtfully. She was warm and engaging. Everyone seemed charmed.
"Ian and Ray never join these lunches," Ela said. "They prefer eating in the office."
"Different people have different needs. I won't take it personally."
She asked Jay about his role and responsibilities. He answered politely but kept his guard up. Ian's wariness was contagious.
At four, Ray left the office without acknowledging anyone. He put on his coat, picked up his bag, and walked out. He hadn't spoken to Liv once.
At five, Liv said her goodbyes and departed with the rest of the team. Jay stayed behind.
Ian emerged from his office at six. He looked tired.
"She seems very competent," Jay said.
"She is."
"But you're cautious."
"She's skilled at reading people and situations. That makes me wary."
"Do you think she's manipulative?"
"No. If I suspected that, I wouldn't have hired her. But I prefer to be cautious. She's very good at fitting in. At saying the right things. That kind of social intelligence can be used in many ways."
"I understand."
"Give it time. I might be overly suspicious."
But Jay trusted Ian's judgment. If Ian was wary, there was a reason.
That evening, as he rode the metro home, he thought about the new hires. The team was changing. Growing. Jay wasn't sure if that was entirely a good thing.
Scene 2
Nothing to offer
By Wednesday, the new hires were assigned their desks in the middle of the room, closer to Ray. HR's cheerful pep talks had ended. Now the real work began.
The office felt fuller. Out of twelve available desks, ten were occupied. It was still spacious, even fully staffed, the room wouldn't feel cramped, but it felt less airy now. More voices, more movement.
Jay gathered Rin and Gal by his desk. "I'll be guiding you through the initial tasks. But I want to be clear, I'm not your supervisor. Ian is. If you have concerns, you bring them to him. If you need to know where the staplers are kept, ask me."
"Understood," Gal said.
"Got it. So you're like... a fellow sufferer?" Rin said. He was adjusting his tie again.
"I'm Ian's assistant. I've been here longer, so I know the systems. But we're all on the same team."
"Right. Sorry. I'll try not to mess up too badly."
"You'll be fine."
They were polite, maybe a little too eager to please. Rin made jokes every time he fumbled something. When he accidentally printed too many documents, he laughed and said he was testing the system. When he misspelled a client name in a draft, he said he was creating an alternate timeline. Gal laughed at all of them, though she didn't seem the type who found many things funny.
Jay led them through the daily tasks. How to reserve conference rooms, where archived files were kept, how the printers operated.
They followed close behind. Rin scribbled notes he'd never be able to read later. Gal committed everything to memory.
"And these are the naming conventions. They're specific and they're not negotiable. Ian will notice if you deviate." Jay said, pulling up a document on his screen.
"Client code, date, document type, version number. No spaces, underscores only. Is that the template?" Gal asked.
"Yes."
"What about the shared drives? Is there a directory structure document?"
"Yes. I'll send it to you both. The folder hierarchy is strict. Don't create new folders without checking with Ian first."
"Why?"
"Because he designed the system. And it works. Changing it creates problems."
Gal nodded. She asked good questions. Jay had to admit she'd probably adapt fast.
That afternoon, he sat with Ian in his office, building a list of small assignments for the new analysts. Summaries, file formatting, basic data entry.
"These were my tasks when I started," Jay said.
"You learned quickly."
"I used to bring them home. I'd stay up until midnight perfecting them."
Ian looked at him. "That wasn't necessary."
"It felt necessary. I needed to feel I belonged here."
His old refrigerator had been plastered with notes. Client names, dates, shorthand reminders. He used to read them whenever he heated up dinner or made tea. Now his new refrigerator was spotless. Everything was already committed to memory.
"They'll learn at their own pace. Don't expect them to match your standards."
"I know."
"And Jay. You did belong here. From the beginning."
Jay looked down at the document on his screen. "Thank you."
At his desk the next morning, he watched Gal dive straight into her work. Her desk was already organized, files neatly labeled.
Rin seemed uncertain. He kept opening and closing files, checking his notes, then rechecking them. He was overthinking everything. When he finally submitted his draft to Jay, it was adequate but hesitant, full of qualifiers and cautious phrasing.
Liv drifted between desks like sunlight, stopping to offer encouragement or small talk. She paused by Rin's desk, glancing at his screen.
"How are you finding the work so far?" she asked.
"Trying not to drown," Rin said.
"You're doing fine. Everyone feels overwhelmed at first."
"Did you?"
"Constantly. For at least six months."
Rin smiled, looking relieved. Liv patted his shoulder and moved on to Gal's desk, asking about her previous role, complimenting her organization skills.
She had a knack for making everyone relax.
Ray, on the other hand, hadn't said a single word since eight o'clock. He sat at his desk with headphones on, working through his assignments. When Rin accidentally knocked into his chair while reaching for a file, Ray didn't even look up.
The difference between Liv and Ray became more visible as the days passed. She chatted happily, asked personal questions while never prying, showed interest without being nosy. She was easy to like.
But Jay was cautious. He was polite with her, answered her questions, but never volunteered information.
The rest of the team had no such reservations. Amy discussed her weekend plans with Liv. Luc told stories about his flatmates. Even Kim opened up about his gaming hobby when Liv asked.
The new hires were absorbed into the lunch outings. They kept close to Jay, looking to him for cues.
"What's good here?" Rin asked, studying the menu at Willow & Sage.
"Everything. I've tried the entire menu. Soups are excellent. The mushroom risotto if you're vegetarian. The salmon if you want something lighter."
"You've tried everything?" Gal asked.
"It's my favourite restaurant."
"What do you recommend most?"
"The autumn squash soup. And the rosemary bread. But that's seasonal, so it won't be available until September."
"You really have tried everything," Rin said.
The first week ended with no complications. The new hires were learning well. Jay explained everything in detail, guiding them through assignments, answering questions.
On Friday afternoon, he gathered them both at his desk again.
"I want to prepare you for what's coming. In July, we start quarterly reporting season. It gets hectic. Long hours, tight deadlines. Everyone's stressed."
"How long does it last?" Gal asked.
"About a week. Then there's a company party afterward."
"We got invitations with our onboarding package," Rin said. "Are we expected to go?"
"It's not mandatory, but everyone does."
"What's it like?" Gal asked.
"While the event is quite formal, the atmosphere is casual. People relax after the reporting season. There's food, drinks. It's a good opportunity to meet people from other departments."
When Jay started, no one explained these things to him. Adapting had been hard. He wanted to ease their experience.
"Thank you," Rin said. "This is really helpful."
"You're both doing well. Keep asking questions if you're uncertain about anything."
Liv made her place in the team fast. She learned the clients, the formats, the expectations. She never overstepped, never challenged Ian's authority.
Ray, on the other hand, had no reservations whenever he didn't like something.
"This timeline is unrealistic," Ray said on Friday afternoon, reviewing a project plan.
"The client requested it," Ian said.
"The client doesn't understand the complexity."
"Can it be done?"
"Yes. But not well."
"Then we'll need to manage their expectations."
"You should do that now. Before we commit resources."
"You're right. I'll contact them Monday."
It was clear they were both fluent with this sort of work, but their approaches were completely different. Liv adapted and accommodated. Ray was blunt and uncompromising.
Jay respected both styles, but he trusted Ray more. There was no performance with Ray, just direct honesty. With Liv, he couldn't shake the feeling that every interaction was evaluated and managed. Ian's wariness made sense now.
On Saturday, Jay went to his old gym. More because he needed moral support than to exercise.
Rus was on the treadmill when Jay arrived. He waved and finished his set, then joined Jay by the weights.
"You look thoughtful," Rus said.
"New hires started this week."
"How's it going?"
"Fine. They're both competent."
"But?"
"But the office feels different."
"Different how?"
Jay sat on the bench beside him. "Fuller. Busier."
"Is that bad?"
"No. It's good for the company. We needed the support. But I miss the quiet."
"Are you doing alright otherwise? You seem tense."
"I'm fine."
"You're always fine. That's your problem."
"What's that supposed to mean?"
"It means you never admit when something's bothering you."
Jay picked up his own weights and started working. Rus didn't push further. After they finished, Rus invited him for drinks.
"I can't. I have things to do."
"You always have things to do."
"I'm not a pub person. You know that."
"Fair enough. But if you need to talk, call me."
"I will."
Afterwards, Jay went to Café Lemon. It wasn't Fay's shift. A younger woman took his order. He still enjoyed his cappuccino in peace, sitting by the window and watching people pass by.
June was much cooler than last year. No heatwaves, just frequent rain. The sky was gray more often than blue. It suited his mood.
On Sunday, Jay went to his favorite park to clear his head. The weather wasn't inspiring, cloudy and windy, but he needed to stop and think. His life seemed to move very fast these days, and he barely had time to process any of it.
Maybe that was better. Because his thoughts inevitably always returned to Ian. And he was scared of admitting what that meant.
He walked the paths slowly, hands in his pockets. The park was nearly empty. A few joggers, an elderly couple feeding birds. He found a bench overlooking the pond and sat down.
He thought about waking up in Ian's bed at the resort. About Ian saying he looked beautiful at the gala. About every late evening in the office. About how his heart raced whenever Ian smiled at him. How he looked for excuses to go to Ian's office. 
He couldn't admit what it meant. 
Not because Ian was his boss. Not even because Ian was a man. But because it was absolutely hopeless.
Ian would never see him romantically. He'd been burned before by workplace relationships. He'd built walls for good reasons. He wasn't going to tear them down for his awkward assistant who barely knew how to function in high society.
Jay had nothing to offer. He was just someone who worked hard and tried not to embarrass himself.
Ian was kind to him. Protective, even. But that was mentorship. So there was no point even considering such thoughts.
A few drops of rain began to fall. Jay got up and walked back toward the metro station. By the time he reached his apartment, the rain was coming down steadily.
He made tea and sat on his balcony under the covered section, watching the rain fall on the river. He thought about Monday morning, returning to the office, seeing Ian through the glass wall. He couldn't want more than that, because wanting more would only lead to heartbreak.
Scene 3
Trapped
The second week went well enough. Rin sat close to Luc, and they exchanged dry observations throughout the day. They were clearly clicking with each other.
"I've discovered a new way to break the filing system," Rin said on Tuesday afternoon.
"That's impressive. Most people need at least a month to achieve that level of destruction," Luc replied.
Gal was in the corner near Amy and Max. She often went to Jay for clarification. Her questions only multiplied as the week progressed.
"Jay, the file naming convention for archived quarterly reports—does it include the fiscal year or calendar year?"
"Fiscal."
"And if there are amendments?"
"Add a version number. The document I sent you has examples."
"Right. Sorry. I saw that. I just wanted to confirm."
"It's fine. Better to ask than guess wrong."
She returned to her desk. Ten minutes later she was back.
"The client portfolios in the shared drive—are those updated weekly or monthly?"
"Weekly on Mondays. Unless there's a major transaction, then immediately."
"Okay. Thank you."
She seemed eager, almost anxious to get everything exactly right. Jay spent a lot of time during the day instructing both of them, answering questions, reviewing their work. Then he caught up on his own assignments in the evenings.
Ian monitored him closely. Jay seemed maybe a bit tired, a bit less talkative. But overall he didn't seem bothered, so Ian was relieved.
Their shared overtime in an empty office felt different now. Like the retreat had both brought them closer and revealed additional barriers at the same time.
They still worked late together most evenings. But the conversations had become harder to start. They sometimes exchanged looks without saying anything, neither breaking eye contact. Then one of them would turn back to their screen and the moment would pass.
Jay wanted to chat with Ian like they used to. Sitting on the couch in the lounge, drinking coffee, talking about nothing important. But he was also afraid. Of his own feelings, mostly. 
At the retreat, the closeness had felt natural. There were no desks, no formal roles. Just two people talking by a fire. In the office, everything seemed to highlight the barriers between them. The glass wall. The impossibility of it all.
Jay was afraid of being too obvious. Of letting something slip. And at the same time, he missed their closeness desperately.
On Thursday evening, he stayed until nine. Ian emerged from his office at eight thirty.
"You should go home. Get some rest."
"I'm almost finished."
"Jay."
"Five more minutes."
Ian stood beside his desk, close enough that Jay could smell his cologne. Jay kept his eyes on his screen. If he looked up, he'd say something stupid. Something that would ruin everything.
"Goodnight, Ian."
"Goodnight."
Ian left first. Jay waited ten minutes before packing his bag.
An integration party happened on Friday evening to help new hires feel more at home at the team's favorite bar, Murphy's.
Ian went, which was unusual for him. He rarely attended these events. But he felt obligated. The new hires were his responsibility. Ray was naturally absent.
The bar was crowded and loud. The team claimed their a table near the back. Drinks were ordered. Conversations overlapped.
Ian stood near the bar with a glass of whiskey. He watched Jay across the room. He was talking with Liv and Gal, all three of them smiling. Liv said something and Jay laughed. Gal added a comment and Jay responded animatedly.
It was lively and natural. Jay looked relaxed, engaged. He wasn't the awkward, uncertain person he'd been two years ago.
Ian never really talked with his team that much during these events. He attended, stayed for an appropriate amount of time, then left. Small talk exhausted him. He had nothing to contribute to conversations about weekend plans or television shows.
But Jay was different. He could talk to anyone now. He made people comfortable. Even Gal was speaking freely with him.
Luc joined their group, then Rin. Ela and Zoe had joined them as well. The circle expanded. 
Ian watched from across the room at beautiful women flocking to Jay. It hurt to witness. It only highlighted the inevitability of Jay eventually drifting away.
Maybe he was already drifting. Their evening conversations had become stilted. Jay left earlier now than he used to. He had other friends, other places to be. He had a life outside the office.
That was good. Ian wanted Jay to have a full, rich life. But it also meant Jay didn't need him anymore. Ian checked his watch. Ten o'clock. Acceptable to leave.
He found Amy. "I'm heading out. Thank you for organizing this."
"Already? The night is young."
"I have an early morning."
"You always have an early morning. Goodnight, Ian."
"Goodnight."
Ian left without saying goodbye to anyone else. 
His apartment was dark and silent. He turned on the lights, poured himself a glass of whiskey, and sat on the couch.
He shouldn't have gone to the party. He'd known it would be difficult. But he'd hoped—
What had he hoped? That Jay would seek him out? That Jay would stand by his side instead of socializing with everyone else?
That was ridiculous. Jay was supposed to socialize. He was supposed to make connections, build relationships with his colleagues. Ian wanted that for him.
But watching Liv touch Jay's arm, watching Gal look at him with clear admiration—it had been unbearable.
Ian took a drink. The whiskey burned.
Jay was surrounded by beautiful, charming women. Liv was elegant and warm. Gal was intelligent and attentive. Ela and Zoe were amiable and friendly. Any of them would be a better match for Jay than he ever could be. And Jay was young, radiant. He could have anyone he wanted. There was no shortage of attractive people in the world. Jay could meet anyone at any time. There were probably dozens of people interested in him. He was kind, intelligent, beautiful.
And Ian had no claim on him. No right to feel possessive or territorial. Jay was his assistant. His colleague. Nothing more.
But Ian wanted more. He'd wanted more for months now. He'd tried to suppress it, tried to be appropriate. But the retreat had broken something open in him. Waking up beside Jay. Talking late into the night by the fire. The way Jay had looked at him during the fashion show.
For a brief moment, Ian had let himself believe there might be something there. Some reciprocal feeling. Some possibility. But back in the office, the distance had returned.
Ian finished his whiskey and poured another.
He'd been extremely wary of Liv from the start. Not because of business reasons. Her credentials were impeccable, her work excellent. Because she was beautiful and charming. Because Jay smiled when talking to her. Because she represented everything Ian couldn't offer.
It didn't matter that she was happily married. What if Jay preferred her company? What if he stopped looking at Ian with those admiring eyes and instead moved on to someone else?
Someone appropriate. Someone who could take him to nice restaurants and weekend trips. Someone who could love him openly.
Ian knew he was being unreasonable. Jealousy was unproductive and childish. Liv had done nothing wrong. She was a valuable addition to the team. Jay was allowed to have friendships, relationships, a life beyond work.
But he couldn't contain it. Every time Liv made Jay laugh, Ian felt something twist in his chest. Every time Gal asked Jay for help with that eager expression, Ian wanted to intervene.
He was jealous of his own employees. Of women who'd done nothing but be friendly. It was absurd, but it was also consuming him.
Ian set down his glass and leaned back against the couch. The apartment was too quiet, too empty. He thought about Jay twelve minutes away, probably just getting home from the party. Maybe still thinking about the conversations he'd had. Maybe texting someone. Maybe smiling at his phone.
Ian had spent two years managing his feelings. Keeping them hidden and controlled. He'd told himself it was enough to be near Jay, to mentor him, to watch him thrive. But it wasn't enough anymore.
The retreat had shown him what it could be like. What it felt like to have Jay's undivided attention, to talk freely without the weight of their roles pressing down on them. To fall asleep beside him and wake up to find him still there.
And now Ian couldn't go back to pretending he didn't want that. He wanted Jay. He wanted him so completely it frightened him.
But Jay was slipping away. Making other connections. Building a life that didn't revolve around late nights in the office. And Ian had no right to stop him.
He couldn't keep doing this. He couldn't keep watching Jay from behind barriers he'd built himself. But he also couldn't cross those barriers. He couldn't risk Jay's career, his comfort, his trust. He couldn't be selfish enough to confess feelings that would only make everything complicated and painful. Jay was his assistant. The power imbalance made any relationship inappropriate. Jay deserved better than a boss who couldn't keep his feelings in check.
And even if the circumstances were different, why would Jay want him? Ian was cold and detached. He didn't know how to be warm the way Liv was warm. He didn't know how to make people feel at ease.
So he was trapped. Loving someone he couldn't have. Watching someone he wanted drift slowly out of reach.
This was his own fault. He'd let himself fall despite knowing better. He'd allowed hope to grow where there should have been only restraint. Now he'd pay the price for that weakness.
He thought about texting him. Asking if he'd gotten home safely. But that would be transparent. Pathetic.
So he sat in the dark and drank his whiskey and tried not to think about beautiful women surrounding Jay at the bar. Tried not to imagine Jay smiling at someone else the way he sometimes smiled at Ian.
He was losing Jay. Maybe not today. Maybe not next month. But eventually. And there was nothing he could do to stop it.
By midnight, he'd finished half the bottle. 
He went to his bedroom, but he knew he wouldn't sleep. He'd lie awake thinking about Jay at the party, surrounded by people who could offer him everything Ian couldn't. He sat on the edge of his bed and put his head in his hands. 
He'd never felt more alone.
Scene 4
The wrong kind of attention
The following week, Gal was too enthusiastic.
Since Monday after the party, she seemed to cling to Jay even more. She joined him for coffee in the break room. During their team lunch outing, she sat next to him and asked about his weekend, his apartment, his commute.
"How long have you lived in the city?" she asked.
"A few years now."
"Do you like it?"
"It's fine."
"Did it take you long to adapt?"
"A while," Jay said. He took a bite of his salmon, hoping the conversation would move on.
It didn't. Gal kept asking questions. What neighbourhood did he live in? Did he have roommates? Where did he go to university?
Jay answered politely but minimally. He didn't know how to discourage her without hurting her feelings. She was new, eager, trying to make connections. He remembered being in her position, but it still made him uncomfortable.
"Could you review this formatting? I want to make sure I'm doing it correctly," she asked on Monday afternoon.
Jay glanced at the document. "It looks fine. You can submit it to Ian."
"Are you sure? I don't want to make mistakes."
"You're doing well. Don't worry so much."
She smiled. "Thank you. You're very patient with me."
She used to be enthusiastic before, but it was slowly turning more personal. On Tuesday morning, she brought him coffee.
"I noticed you always have it at nine. So I made you one."
"That's kind. Thank you."
"It's no trouble. We're making coffee at the same time anyway."
She was trying hard to be helpful, but the attention felt excessive.
Ian was suddenly on high alert. He'd been mostly focused on Liv, but it seemed the dangers might come from another angle. He kept his distance but tracked every interaction. Through the glass wall, he watched Gal approach Jay's desk repeatedly and his polite but strained responses. Ian's expression never changed, but his wariness grew.
Gal stayed overtime on Tuesday evening over a minor formatting issue. She was there early the next morning, arriving at the same time as Jay to make coffee.
"Good morning," she said brightly.
"Morning."
"Did you sleep well?"
"Fine. You?"
"Not bad. I was up late finishing that summary."
"You could have left it for today."
"I wanted to make sure it was right."
She lingered while Jay poured his coffee. When he returned to his desk, she followed and stood by his chair.
"Can I ask you something?"
"Of course."
"How do you manage everything? You're always so organized and calm. I feel like I'm constantly scrambling."
"You've only been here a few weeks. It takes time."
"But you make it look easy."
"It's not. I just know the systems now."
"You're really good at this."
"Thank you."
Each following day, she gave him more attention. Friday afternoon, she asked if he wanted to review her work together instead of just submitting it.
"I think I'd learn more if you walked me through the feedback," she said.
"I can do that."
They sat together at his desk. Gal pulled her chair close, leaning in to see the screen. Jay explained the formatting issues, the phrasing adjustments. She nodded seriously, taking notes.
"You're a really good teacher," she said when they finished.
"I'm just doing my job."
"No, really. You're patient. And you explain things clearly. I'm lucky to have you as a mentor."
Jay didn't know what to say to that. He understood trying hard. He'd done the same thing at the beginning—arrived early, tried desperately to prove himself. He felt sympathy.
But for Ian, her attention was immediately suspect.
He remembered the man who'd deceived him years ago. The eager assistant who'd seemed so earnest, so dedicated. Who'd stayed late and asked thoughtful questions and looked at him with admiration. The pattern was too familiar.
Rin, meanwhile, was way more relaxed about everything. Not exactly lazy, but definitely not an overachiever. He completed his assignments adequately and left at five o'clock without looking back.
He got friendly with Luc quickly. Luc was the friendliest on the team, easy to talk to, always ready with a joke or story. Their banter lightened the atmosphere.
"I've managed to confuse the filing system again," Rin said.
"That's a talent. How did you accomplish it this time?"
"I'm not entirely sure. I clicked something and everything disappeared."
"Did you try clicking it again?"
"Obviously. That made it worse."
"Classic mistake."
They worked through the problem together, laughing about it the entire time. Rin also sat closest to Ray. Whenever Ray got up to get coffee, Rin tried casual small talk.
"Nice weather today," Rin said on Tuesday morning.
Ray walked past without responding.
On Wednesday, Rin tried again. "Did you see the market report this morning?"
Ray ignored him completely.
On Thursday, Rin switched tactics. "I heard the new lunch place on Fifth Street is good."
Still nothing.
But Rin wasn't discouraged at all. Each day he picked a new topic, hoping something would finally catch Ray's attention. On Thursday afternoon, Rin approached Jay's desk.
"Can I ask you something?"
"Of course."
"Does Ray ever talk to anyone?"
"Not really. He keeps to himself."
"Is he always like this?"
"Yes. He's very focused on his work."
Rin looked relieved. "Okay. Good. I thought maybe I'd offended him somehow."
"You haven't. That's just how he is."
"Everyone here seems terrifying, honestly. But Ray is actually less scary than the rest of you."
"Less scary?"
"Yeah. He doesn't look as polished."
"Ray is extremely competent."
"I know. But he doesn't look it. He looks like someone who rolled out of bed and came to work. That's approachable."
Jay tried to view the team through the perspective of a new person. He'd been here so long that everyone just seemed like themselves. It was difficult for him to imagine how everyone must look to Rin. Ian in his perfectly tailored suits. Amy and Ela always impeccably dressed. Even Luc looked casually sophisticated.
He remembered his first days. His country mannerisms. How out of place he'd felt. How everyone had seemed impossibly competent. Would Ray have seemed more approachable back then? Simply because he didn't look as polished? Maybe. Ray dressed well enough, but not with the attention others did. His hair was always slightly messy. There was something deliberately unremarkable about his presentation.
"Do we really seem terrifying?"
"Yes. Ray is the only one who doesn't. Everyone else looks like they stepped out of a magazine."
"Even me?"
"Especially you. You're always perfectly dressed. You know everything about everything. You're calm and organized. It's intimidating."
"I suppose that makes sense," Jay said.
"You probably don't know what it's like," Rin sighed.
"I was the same at the beginning."
"Really?"
"I wore cheap suits and had no idea how anything worked. I was terrified for months."
"You don't seem like the terrified type."
"I got better at hiding it."
"That's encouraging, I guess."
By Friday, Gal's attention had become impossible to ignore.
She appeared at Jay's desk first thing in the morning with coffee. She asked him to review documents that didn't need reviewing. She sat beside him at lunch and asked personal questions.
"Do you live near the office?" she asked.
"About twenty minutes away."
"That's convenient. I'm still commuting from my parents' place. It takes nearly an hour."
"That's a long commute."
"I'm looking for an apartment closer. Do you have any recommendations?"
"The area near the river is nice. That's where I live."
"Maybe you could show me around sometime?"
Jay felt trapped. It was a reasonable request, but it felt like more than that.
"I'm sure the real estate agents can give you better information than I can."
"I'd rather hear from someone who actually lives there."
"I'll send you some listings."
He returned to his desk feeling relieved to have escaped, but Gal followed him.
"Could you look at this summary? I'm not sure about the conclusion."
Jay reviewed it quickly. "It's fine. Submit it to Ian."
"Are you sure? I don't want to bother him with something that's not perfect."
"It's his job to review your work. That's the process."
"But you're so much more approachable."
Ian was watching from his office. Jay could feel his attention like a weight.
"Ian is very fair. You don't need to be afraid of him."
"I'm not afraid. I just prefer working with you."
She smiled at him. It was a warm, honest smile, but it made Jay deeply uncomfortable. He didn't know what to say, so he said nothing and turned back to his computer.
That evening, Jay stayed late. After Gal finally left at six, Ian emerged from his office.
"Can we talk?"
"Of course."
Ian closed the door to his office. They sat across from each other. Jay could see the tension in his posture.
"Gal seems to be seeking your attention frequently."
"She's eager. Trying to learn."
"It seems excessive."
"I thought so too. But I remember how I was at the beginning. Always asking questions. I was probably annoying as well."
"You weren't like this. You didn't bring coffee uninvited or find excuses to sit beside me."
"I was terrified of you. That probably limited my enthusiasm."
"I don't want you to feel obligated to accommodate her beyond normal mentoring."
"I'm just trying to help her adjust."
"I understand. But if her attention becomes uncomfortable, you can redirect her to me."
"I will. Thank you."
"You're too kind sometimes."
"Is that a bad thing?"
"No. But people can take advantage of kindness."
Jay thought about that after he left. About Ian's wariness, about Gal's attention. He still believed she was just trying hard, but Ian's concern had planted a seed of doubt. Maybe he was being naive. Maybe he was missing something.
Ian watched him from his office. This was going to be a problem.
Scene 5
Sweet closeness
On Saturday, Jay went to his old gym and found Rus near the rowing machine.
"You look stressed," Rus said.
"One of the new hires is being clingy."
"The junior analyst?"
"Gal. She follows me around constantly. Asks questions she could figure out herself. Sits next to me at lunch."
"Can't you redirect her to someone else?"
"I've tried. She always comes back."
"Have you told her to back off?"
"No. She's new. I don't want to hurt her feelings."
"But she's making you uncomfortable."
"Yes," Jay admitted.
"What does your boss think?"
"He noticed. He warned me to be careful."
"Smart man."
They moved to the weights, but Jay was distracted.
"I still haven't found a new gym. I work out twice a week for half an hour at home after work. But it's not the same. The gym atmosphere is more motivating."
"You're always welcome to stay here forever. Or you could try jogging. The weather's finally nice."
Jay thought about it. It was true. The weather had turned pleasant—not too hot, with long days and comfortable evenings. The city was actually tolerable in summer for once.
"Maybe I could jog by the river."
"There you go. Fresh air, exercise, no clingy coworkers."
"I don't know if I can run properly."
"No one can run properly when they start. You just do it anyway."
Jay finished his set. Rus was right. Maybe jogging would help. At least it would get him out of his apartment.
"Thanks for listening," Jay said.
"Anytime. And seriously, if the clingy coworker becomes a real problem, talk to HR."
"It's not that bad."
"Yet. But keep it in mind."
At work the following week, Gal continued to follow Jay around whenever she could. Jay was polite but didn't really engage beyond answering her questions and returning to his own work.
"Jay, do you have a minute?" she asked on Monday morning.
"I'm in the middle of something. Can it wait?"
"Oh. Sure. I'll come back later."
She returned fifteen minutes later. "Is now a good time?"
"What do you need?"
"I was wondering about the client retention reports. How detailed should they be?"
"Follow the template I sent you."
"Right. But should I include the quarterly breakdown or just annual?"
"Quarterly."
"Okay. And what about—"
"The template has examples. Look at those first. If you still have questions after, come back," Jay said, trying to keep his tone gentle.
"Oh. Okay. Sorry."
She returned to her desk. Jay felt guilty but also relieved.
As July approached and quarterly reports loomed, it was time to introduce the senior analysts to the workload. Ian organized meetings every afternoon with Liv and Ray. Amy and Max showed the fundamentals and the general requirements. Jay was there too, mostly as administrative support. He knew the formats, file systems, and delivery methods intimately. He wrote down the timelines and meeting summaries afterwards.
"The reports are due by the tenth. We compile data the first week. Final reviews and submissions in the final days," Ian explained.
"That's tight," Liv said.
"It's always tight. You learn to work fast."
"What's the typical workload?"
"Sixty to seventy hours per week. Sometimes more."
"And everyone participates?"
"Senior analysts lead their assigned portfolios. Junior analysts provide support. Jay coordinates submissions and manages the schedule."
Liv nodded, taking notes. Ray sat silently, absorbing the information. Amy and Max exchanged looks—they'd been through this before.
"Any questions?" Ian asked.
"Are there templates for the analysis sections?" Ray asked.
"Yes. Jay will distribute them tomorrow."
"What's the acceptable error margin?"
"Zero. We verify everything twice."
Ray made a note. Liv asked follow-up questions. Jay typed everything into his laptop.
In the evenings, he stayed over with Ian, catching up on the regular work that was slowly starting to pile up. The quarterly preparation consumed the afternoons. Their normal tasks accumulated.
On Wednesday, something urgent came up—a client needed revisions on a proposal by morning. They worked until ten. When Jay finally closed his laptop, his eyes burned from staring at the screen.
"I'll drive you home," Ian said.
Jay looked up, surprised. "You don't have to."
"We're neighbours. It's no trouble."
"That would be nice. Thank you."
Ian had wanted to do this for the longest time, but he'd been careful about not overstepping, not shaking the fragile balance they'd built. This felt like the most natural moment. They were both exhausted. The offer was practical.
They took the elevator down to the parking garage. Jay sank into the passenger seat. The drive was short and comfortable. Ian drove smoothly. Jay watched the city pass outside the window.
"Are you ready for next week?" Ian asked.
"As ready as I can be."
"It will be intense."
"I know."
They pulled up in front of Jay's building. 
"Thank you for driving me," Jay said.
"Anytime."
Jay opened the door, then hesitated. "Goodnight, Ian."
"Goodnight, Jay."
Jay went inside. Ian waited until he saw the lobby door close, then drove home. He felt happy. It was such a small thing, driving Jay home, but it had felt right.
He still had some time to have Jay for himself, before Jay inevitably got taken from him. He could still savour this sweet closeness they'd developed.
Ian poured himself a glass of water and stood by the window. Twelve minutes away, Jay was in his apartment. Maybe making tea. Maybe already in bed. Ian allowed himself to imagine it for a moment. Then he pushed the thought away and went to prepare for tomorrow.
The next day, Gal was hovering around Jay's desk again with questions that barely qualified as questions.
"Do you think this phrasing is okay, or should I rework it?"
"It's fine."
"Are you sure? I feel like it could be clearer."
"Gal, it's fine."
"Maybe if I—"
"Excuse me," a voice said.
They both turned. Ray was standing there, holding a folder.
"I need to talk to Jay," Ray said. 
"Oh. I can wait."
"This is work-related and time-sensitive. Return to your desk," Ray said bluntly.
Gal's face fell. She walked back, clearly sulking.
Ray sat down in the chair she'd vacated. "I need to clarify the timeline for the quarterly data verification. How many stages?"
"Three. Initial check, cross-reference, final review."
"Who handles each stage?"
"Initial check is the analyst who compiled the data. Cross-reference is a different analyst. Final review is Ian."
"What's the turnaround time?"
"Twenty-four hours per stage. Seventy-two hours total."
"Acceptable. Thank you."
Ray returned to his desk without another word.
Jay stared after him. That was the first time they'd actually spoken. It had been a series of technical questions, nothing more. But Jay was glad Gal had left him alone.
From his office, Ian had watched the entire exchange. When Ray bluntly dismissed Gal, Ian smiled secretly. Maybe she'd get a clue.
That evening, Jay returned home at a normal hour. The weather was good—warm but not oppressive, with a pleasant breeze. He decided to try jogging.
He changed into gym clothes and went down to the river path. Other people were out running, cycling, walking dogs. Jay started at an easy pace.
His running form wasn't very good. His breathing became laboured quickly and his stride felt awkward. After half an hour, he returned home sweaty and miserable. Running was harder than it looked. He showered and collapsed on the couch. Maybe jogging wasn't for him. Or maybe he just needed practice.
He thought about texting Rus but decided against it. Instead, he made tea and sat on the balcony, watching the city lights come on as evening fell.
Friday was consumed by last-minute preparations. Everyone was busy. Files were organized, templates distributed, schedules confirmed.
Ian called a brief team meeting at four.
"Next week will be intense. Expect long hours. Prioritize urgent tasks. Ask for help if you're overwhelmed. We're a team. We support each other."
Everyone nodded. The new hires looked nervous. The veterans looked resigned.
Jay worked through his checklist. By evening, most people had left, exhausted from the week. Only he and Ian remained. They worked until ten again. When Jay finally stood to pack his things, Ian appeared in his doorway.
"I'll drive you home."
"You don't have to—"
"It's late, Jay. Come on."
Jay didn't argue. They took the elevator down together, got in Ian's car, drove through the city streets.
"Have a restful weekend. You'll need it," Ian said when they arrived.
"You too."
"I'll try."
Jay got out of the car. "Thank you for the ride."
"Anytime."
Jay went inside. Ian watched until the door closed, then drove home.
Jay took the elevator up to his apartment. He dropped his bag by the door and went straight to the bedroom. He was too tired to make tea, too tired to do anything but collapse.
But as he lay in bed staring at the ceiling, all he could think about was Ian's profile in the car, streetlights  illuminating his face. The comfort of sitting beside him.
Jay closed his eyes.
He was in trouble. Deep, hopeless trouble. But there was nothing he could do about it. So he'd do what he always did—push it down, ignore it, focus on work. It had worked so far.
