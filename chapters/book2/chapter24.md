Chapter 24: Business trip
Scene 1
Departure
Jay descended the stairs of his building at ten minutes to twelve, his nerves making him leave early. The sleek black limousine pulled up exactly one minute later.
The driver immediately stepped out to handle Jay's luggage. "Mr. Hall? I'll take care of this for you."
Ian was seated inside, impeccably dressed in a charcoal gray suit. He looked up from his phone as Jay got in.
"Good morning, Jay. I trust you slept well?"
"Yes, thank you." Jay smoothed down his three-piece suit, feeling self conscious about the formal cut. "The timing worked out perfectly."
"The new suit is quite elegant. Very appropriate for our meetings."
Jay felt heat rise in his cheeks. "Leo arranged it. Along with the others."
Ian's expression immediately sharpened, concern replacing politeness. "Leo arranged your clothing? Did he... say anything to you?"
Jay was quiet for a moment, looking out the window at the city passing by. "He did say things, but if I'm being honest, I don't trust a word that comes from Leo's mouth."
Unexpectedly, Ian laughed. "I don't blame you. It's probably the most prudent choice. Though I should mention that Leo isn't a bad person, despite appearances. He has a rather playful personality and can be insufferable, but I do trust him." 
"I don't. And I'm unlikely to change my mind about that."
"Did he say something to upset you?"
"Not exactly. He was just being ridiculous, as always. He probably set up that fancy tailor appointment only to humiliate me."
"Was the arrangement unpleasant?"
Jay chose his words carefully. "The staff was... diplomatically speaking, rude."
"Which tailor did he send you to?"
"Saviour & Sons."
"No wonder. That's the poshest establishment in the city, but also the most patronizing place you could possibly visit."
"I bet they definitely wouldn't be rude to you though."
"Actually, they would. I'm banned there." 
 "What?"
"You need to understand something about me, Jay. I'm a pariah in high society. After my scandal, places like Saviour & Sons outright refuse to serve me."
Jay was horrified. "If I'd known that, I never would have gone there. Why would Leo send me somewhere that treated you that way?"
"Leo comes from old money—born and raised with a silver spoon. He's unaware of such details. Based on how he's treated there, he probably wouldn't think anyone could have a bad experience. He definitely wasn't being malicious."
"I can't think of any other reason I'd need such expensive suits."
Ian laughed again, and Jay was struck by how much lighter he seemed when his guard was down. "You're Leo's first successful hire. He's making sure his head-hunting skills are properly appreciated by gearing you up appropriately. He'll probably spend the next decade telling me 'I told you so' about needing a proper assistant."
Jay remained unconvinced, but Ian's openness about his past felt significant. His own bad experience suddenly seemed smaller in comparison. He had always thought of himself as uniquely outside the society where he now worked, but apparently Ian didn't have such a good relationship with it either.
"When I lost everything, Leo was the only person who helped me. We've been friends since university, and while his personality can be insufferable, he isn't malicious. He just meddles too much. You can safely disregard anything he says."
"I still hold him responsible for the tailor experience. And if they dared to shun you, I'm doubly displeased with them."
"They did excellent work though," Ian said, his gaze lingering on Jay's appearance before he caught himself and looked away.
Jay felt his cheeks warm again. Ian seemed to notice his discomfort and quickly changed direction.
"Don't let the rude tailors bother you. They're known for being unpleasant and hardly represent anything meaningful. But I'll be sure to give Leo a proper scolding for subjecting you to that experience."
"I'd rather Leo simply kept his distance from me. But I understand that's impossible, since he's practically the boss of the company."
The reminder of the hierarchy, of his position at the bottom of the corporate ladder, made Jay's shoulders tense. He'd have to keep his head down and endure Leo's meddling if he wanted to survive at Turner & Associates.
Ian noticed the change immediately, his expression growing concerned, but before he could respond, Jay's phone rang. Jay looked flustered as he glanced at the caller ID.
"Go ahead, don't mind me," Ian said.
"Hello?"
"Jay!" It wasn't Ema's voice this time, but a younger boy's excited chatter. "Ema told us you're going to another country! Can you send us a postcard? And maybe bring some candy? Or a toy?"
"Ari, this is a business trip. I won't have time to shop around—"
"Please? Ema says rich people always bring presents when they travel!"
Jay could hear Ema's voice in the background, clearly encouraging her youngest brother. "I'll try, but I can't promise anything."
"You're the best brother ever! Ema wants to talk to you again—"
The phone was clearly passed back and forth while his siblings competed for his attention, and Jay smiled despite his embarrassment at the public display.
Ian watched the interaction with obvious amusement. When Jay finally ended the call, looking mortified, Ian was smiling.
"I'll make sure we have Saturday afternoon free for shopping. Consider it compensation for the tailor visit. I'll ensure you have a much better retail experience."
"You don't have to do that—"
"I insist." Ian's tone brooked no argument. "It's nice that you have such a good relationship with your family. You should treasure it."
Jay's expression grew wistful. "Actually, we were never really close. Too far apart in age—I grew up in completely different circumstances than them. I left home as soon as I could to escape the noise of three little children. They're only nice to me now because they can extort gifts."
Ian laughed, seeing right through Jay's facade. "You don't look like you mind being badgered for presents."
"You're probably right. They are good kids."
Soon they arrived at their destination. The airport was a maze of terminals and security checkpoints, but Ian moved through it without trouble. He guided Jay through check-in, explained the security procedures, and showed him how to find their gate.
"The business lounge is through there if you ever need a space to work," Ian said, pointing down a corridor. "And that shop carries decent travel essentials if you forget anything."
They still had time before their flight, so Ian proposed they go to one of the terminal cafes. As they sat at a small table with coffee, Jay realized the awkwardness between them had largely dissolved. The change of scenery seemed to have helped, allowing them to interact more naturally than they had in weeks.
"Thank you for being so patient with all this. I know it must seem ridiculous that someone my age has never flown before."
"Everyone has a first time. There's nothing ridiculous about it."
As they talked, Jay watched Ian with new eyes. The revelation about his social exile, his status as a reject from the world Jay had assumed he belonged to, changed everything. To Jay, Ian was the absolute pinnacle of grace and competence. If someone like Ian could be cast out by high society, then perhaps the problem wasn't with the individual but with the society itself.
The high society must be blind as well as stupid, Jay thought, watching Ian explain airline protocols.
Scene 2
Plane flight
Boarding went more smoothly than Jay had thought. Ian guided him through the process, handling their carry-on luggage and directing Jay to their seats. Their business class seats were more spacious than Jay had imagined, arranged in pairs with generous legroom and privacy screens. Ian gestured toward the window seat.
"I prefer the aisle," he said, though in truth he had no particular preference. He simply wanted to watch Jay's reactions to his first flight experience.
Jay felt slightly sheepish about his obvious inexperience. "Are you sure? I don't want to inconvenience you."
"Not at all. Please, make yourself comfortable."
Jay marveled at the amenities around them—the adjustable lighting, the individual entertainment systems, the blankets already waiting for them. Everything was elegant and foreign.
The takeoff was surprisingly gentle, nothing like the dramatic lurching Jay had braced himself for. The powerful engines created a thrum as they lifted off. Jay wasn't particularly afraid of heights,  and he was mesmerized by the ground falling away below them. The city became a patchwork of lights and geometric patterns, then clouds obscured everything in white cotton.
"This is incredible," Jay murmured, his face pressed to the small window.
Ian smiled, watching Jay's wonder. "Different than you expected?"
"Completely. I thought it would be more... violent, I suppose. This is almost peaceful."
The flight attendants served lunch after they reached cruising altitude, and Jay realized how hungry he'd become in his morning nervousness. The food was surprisingly good—far better than he had expected from airline cuisine, and he ate with appreciation while continuing to peer out at the landscape passing far below.
After lunch, Jay made himself comfortable, glancing occasionally at Ian who had pulled out his tablet to read business publications. Jay had downloaded movies to his laptop and packed both a book and a magazine for the eight-hour journey, but for now he was content to watch the changing scenery outside.
"Enjoying the view?" Ian asked after they'd been airborne for an hour.
"Very much. It's amazing how smooth this whole experience has been." Jay turned from the window to meet Ian's eyes. "Though I suppose I shouldn't be surprised—having you here makes everything better."
He hadn't meant to voice that last thought quite so directly, and immediately felt exposed. He felt heat rise in his cheeks as he realized what he'd admitted, but Ian's expression only grew warmer.
"I'm glad I can help ease the experience."
As Ian returned to his tablet, Jay looked at him with a gaze that held both admiration and a sense of inferiority. He couldn't allow himself to forget his place again. No matter how Ian had been treated by high society, that was still his world. Jay was just passing through, pulled briefly into Ian's orbit by a twist of fate. His place beside Ian was temporary, borrowed, precarious, and he shouldn't make himself too comfortable.
But the yearning was there regardless—to bask in Ian's glow, to allow himself just a bit of indulgence in this fantasy of belonging.
The complicated thoughts must have shown on his face, because Ian looked up with concern.
"Everything alright? You're not feeling nauseous, are you? Some people find the altitude unsettling."
"I'm fine. Maybe the altitude is making me a bit dizzy," Jay said, though he looked somehow sad.
Ian felt a pull to reach out, to gather Jay into his arms and soothe whatever was troubling him. The urge was becoming increasingly difficult to resist, but he knew he couldn't act on it. He would ruin everything, scare Jay away, and lose him forever. 
To break the spell, Ian reached for his laptop. "Perhaps we should watch a movie. Something light to pass the time."
He pulled out two pairs of headphones and selected a well-reviewed comedy, but after twenty minutes he noticed Jay wasn't really watching. His attention kept drifting back to the window, his expression melancholy. Gradually, Jay's eyes grew heavy, and he dozed off against the seat cushion.
Ian wanted to wake him—sleeping too much during the flight would make the jetlag worse—but Jay looked so peaceful that Ian couldn't bring himself to disturb him. Instead, he turned off the movie and watched Jay sleep, memorizing the lines of his face in repose.
Jay woke after two hours, groggy and disoriented. He checked his watch and realized they were halfway through the flight. Ian was reading on his tablet again, the laptop put away. Jay blinked slowly, trying to clear the fog from his mind.
"Sorry for drifting off," he mumbled.
"It's perfectly fine. Would you like some coffee? Or water?"
The flight attendant brought coffee at Ian's request, and the caffeine helped Jay feel marginally more alert, though he remained subdued.
"You shouldn't sleep too much more, or tonight will be rough with the time difference. Perhaps we should try a more energetic film?"
"I'm finding it hard to focus on anything," Jay admitted.
Ian set aside his tablet and turned his attention fully to Jay. "Tell me, what do you know about New Continent customs? I thought I might share some observations about what to expect."
For the remainder of the flight, Ian kept up a stream of conversation—stories about local traditions, business etiquette, amusing cultural differences he'd encountered in previous visits. Jay listened, asking occasional questions, but Ian could see the fatigue weighing on him.
By the time they landed, Jay felt thoroughly drained. Eight hours was the longest he'd ever spent in any vehicle, and despite the comfortable seats, his body felt stiff and sluggish. A driver met them at customs, handling their luggage and guiding them to a waiting car.
The drive to the hotel was uneventful. It was five in the afternoon local time, but Jay's body insisted it was eleven at night back home, and he felt increasingly sleepy with each passing mile.
The hotel was magnificent, a five-star establishment with elegant furnishigs. Their rooms were adjacent, spacious and beautifully appointed. Jay unpacked, fighting the urge to simply collapse onto the inviting bed despite the hunger gnawing at his stomach.
Ian knocked on his door at five-thirty local time.
"Dinner. I know you're tired, but trust me on this. We need to get you on local time as quickly as possible."
"I could just order room service—"
"Absolutely not. Proper dinner downstairs, and no sleeping until at least eight o'clock."
They ate in the hotel's restaurant, Ian maintaining light conversation while Jay struggled with his exhaustion. The food was excellent, but Jay could barely focus on it. Ian could see how hard the travel was hitting him, but he kept Jay downstairs until seven-thirty, ensuring he'd have a better chance of sleeping through the night.
Finally, Ian relented. "You should get some rest now. Tomorrow will be a long day. Set an alarm for morning. We have meetings at ten. I'll meet you for breakfast at seven."
Jay practically stumbled back to his room. He laid out his clothes for the following day, took a quick shower, and fell into bed almost immediately. It was two in the morning back home—later than he'd ever stayed awake in his adult life. The comfortable hotel bed embraced him like a cloud, and he was asleep within minutes.
Scene 3
Business meetings and late night drinks
Jay woke with a start at five in the morning, the remnants of a dream clinging to his consciousness—Ian's arms around him, warmth and safety that felt achingly real until consciousness intruded. He lay still for a moment, disoriented by both the unfamiliar surroundings and the lingering phantom sensation of being held.
Eleven back home. He'd never overslept this badly in his life, but at least he hadn't woken at two in the morning. The jet lag could have been worse.
A long hot bath helped loosen the stiffness from travel and sleep, and by six-thirty he was dressed in the dark blue suit, feeling more human. The hotel restaurant was already serving breakfast, and he found Ian already there, drinking coffee as if he had been awake for hours.
"Good morning. I trust you slept well?"
Jay took the seat across from him. "Better than expected. How long have you been up?"
"Since four. I found the hotel gym and managed a decent workout. Amazing what a proper fitness facility can do for jet lag recovery." Ian's smile was pleased, as if the early morning routine had energized him. 
Jay stared at him with awe. Ian had accomplished so much before dawn, while Jay only managed to return to consciousness. "That's truly impressive."
"Years of habit. The driver won't arrive until nine, so we have plenty of time."
Jay marveled at Ian's stamina as they ate breakfast together, followed by fresh fruit that was somehow more vibrant and flavourful than anything available back home. Everything about the hotel was excessive—the portions, the variety, the service.
"This is my first stay at a proper five-star hotel. I didn't fully appreciate it yesterday."
"The New Continent doesn't do anything by halves. You'll notice that theme everywhere we go."
Jay started to appreciate Leo's outfit intervention as they prepared for their meetings. The expensive suits allowed him to stand beside Ian without shame, even in surroundings that screamed wealth and power.
At eight-thirty, they returned to their rooms to gather their things. Jay couldn't resist taking photos for his siblings—posing next to the enormous bed and at the window overlooking the massive skyline that dwarfed his home city. Everything here was built on a scale that defied reason.
The Garnet Ridge Group offices occupied three floors of a gleaming tower, their reception area alone larger than most companies' entire premises. The CEO, Mac Cartwright, greeted Ian like a long-lost friend, and Jay watched Ian become instantly charming and engaging, moving with an ease that showed how natural this world was for him.
The morning meetings covered strategic partnerships and investment opportunities, topics Jay followed with interest while taking detailed notes. The tour of their offices followed—a company much larger than Turner & Associates, though Jay was becoming accustomed to opulent business environments and wasn't startled by the grandeur.
Lunch at a nearby restaurant felt more like a social visit than a business meal. Jay listened to Ian trade university stories with Mac, fascinated by glimpses of Ian's younger self. The camaraderie between old friends made Jay envious of that kind of belonging.
After lunch, they returned for another round of meetings focused on technical details. Jay was sustained by double coffees and glad that his good night's sleep had left him functional. But as four o'clock approached, fatigue began to creep in.
"We should head back to the hotel. Dinner's not until eight, so you should rest," Ian said as the meetings concluded. 
Jay accepted the advice, setting an alarm for seven before collapsing onto the hotel bed. Sleep came immediately, but the alarm left him groggy and disoriented. Only complimentary coffee in the restaurant managed to restore some semblance of alertness.
Dinner was held at an exclusive restaurant that felt more like a private club. Besides Mac, two other executives and a senior staffer joined them, and Jay quickly realized the cultural differences Ian had mentioned. Where their homeland favoured restraint, these people were boisterous and gregarious. Everyone here reminded him of Max, but dialed up even further. Jay smiled and contributed politely when addressed, but mostly observed Ian. 
Jay abstained from alcohol, but Ian shared whiskey with their hosts, and the gathering grew increasingly animated. Jay held onto a single glass of wine, while Ian matched their hosts drink for drink without showing any effects.
By eleven, the executives were thoroughly intoxicated, their conversation growing louder and more inappropriate. Jay was uncomfortable with the casual crudeness, so different from the environments he knew.
As they prepared to leave, one of the executives made a comment that froze Jay's blood.
"Old Continent certainly knows how to do business. Do your managers routinely travel with such beautiful escorts? Very progressive approach to client relations."
The silence that followed was deafening. Ian's expression went from pleasant to ice-cold fury so quickly that Jay actually took a step back.
"I beg your pardon?" Ian's voice was deadly quiet.
"Oh, come now, don't be coy. Your pretty little—"
"Mr. Hall is my assistant." Ian's words cut through the drunken rambling like a blade. "If you're suggesting what I think you're suggesting, this conversation and our business relationship end right here."
Mac tried to intervene, his face pale with embarrassment. "Zac has had too much to drink, Ian. He doesn't mean—"
"He knows exactly what he means. And I know exactly what kind of company keeps executives who think it's acceptable to sexually harass visiting employees."
Jay hung his head, used to being the target of crude jokes and casual objectification, but the humiliation still burned. He'd hoped the expensive clothes and formal setting would protect him from this kind of treatment, but apparently nothing could.
"Ian, please—" Mac began.
"We're leaving. And you can consider any potential partnership permanently terminated."
They left in a decidedly sour mood, Ian's fury palpable as they walked through the lobby. Only when they reached the car did Ian speak.
"I'm sorry you had to endure that. I definitely won't be doing business with a company that harasses my employees."
"Please don't let it affect your decision-making. Comments like that aren't unusual. It's really not worth—"
"It's absolutely a matter of principle. Some behaviours will not be tolerated under any circumstances."
Back in his room, Jay showered and prepared for bed, but sleep wouldn't come. The executive's words echoed in his mind, along with Ian's fierce defence and the promise to cancel their entire business relationship over the slight. After an hour of staring at the ceiling, he gave up and dressed in his designer outfit—his only clothing that seemed appropriate for the hotel's elegant bar.
The lounge was nearly empty at midnight, just a few other guests and jazz playing in the background. Jay ordered whiskey, hoping alcohol might help him relax enough for sleep.
He was surprised when Ian appeared ten minutes later.
"Couldn't sleep either?" Ian asked.
"I didn't figure you for someone who had trouble sleeping. Thought you had that executive discipline down to a science," Jay replied, attempting lightness.
"I also didn't figure you for much of a drinker," Ian said, signaling the bartender. In truth, he had heard Jay moving around and followed him down.
"It would be a pity not to make use of such a nice hotel. Though truthfully, that afternoon nap probably did me in," Jay said with a wry smile.
"I'm having trouble sleeping as well," Ian admitted, which was true enough. He had been at his laptop, plotting ways to destroy the man who had insulted Jay. "We're supposed to have another meeting tomorrow morning with Garnet Ridge Group executives, but I'm cancelling it along with the entire deal."
"That seems excessive. Being crude toward junior staff isn't exactly unusual in business."
"Not on my watch," Ian said firmly. His inner thoughts were far darker—how dare that man have such thoughts about his Jay? He would wreck the executive's entire career and the company along with it if necessary.
Jay seemed to sense the dangerous undercurrent in Ian's mood and changed the subject. "What's your history with their CEO? You seem to know each other well."
Ian accepted the subject change, perhaps sensing Jay needed distraction from the evening's unpleasantness. They talked for nearly an hour about university days, travel experiences, anything that kept the conversation light and meandering.
"We should probably get some rest," Ian finally said as the bar staff began subtle cleanup around them. "Though I suppose you don't need to wake up early tomorrow, given that our schedule just cleared up."
Jay smiled as they walked toward the elevators. "You certainly are tenacious when you've been drinking."
"I prefer principled, but tenacious works too."
In his room, Jay finally felt drowsy enough for sleep. The evening had been salvaged by Ian's company, even if the business trip itself had taken an unfortunate turn.
Meanwhile, Ian sat in his own room, laptop open. The fury still simmered, made worse by the memory of how defeated Jay appeared after that bastard's comment.
This was supposed to be an exclusively pleasant experience, and some insignificant man had cast a shadow over it. Ian would make sure there were consequences for anyone who dared treat Jay with such disrespect.
Scene 4
Apologies
Jay didn't turn off his alarm. At six-thirty, the shrill sound jolted him from sleep, groggy but functional enough to face another day. He dressed in the gray suit—the third from his collection, ensuring he wouldn't repeat an outfit—and made his way to the restaurant by seven.
Ian was already there, coffee in hand and breakfast half-finished, but his expression showed surprise at Jay's punctual arrival.
"I thought you might sleep in this morning," Ian said as Jay sat across from him with a full plate and coffee.
Jay stifled a dramatic yawn. "Still not used to the time zone, apparently. My body thinks it's one in the afternoon."
"Did you sleep well?"
"Well enough. Just need coffee and sustenance."
Ian wanted to suggest Jay return to bed, but that might come across too strongly. He also didn't want to dwell on the previous evening's unpleasantness first thing in the morning, so he steered the conversation toward safer topics until Jay brought it up himself.
"About yesterday evening—do you really intend to drop the negotiation?"
"I do. Some behaviours can't be overlooked, regardless of potential profit."
Jay felt awkward about being the cause of such a dramatic business decision, but he understood it wasn't truly his fault. Some foolish man had dared act presumptuously to Ian's face and would have to face the consequences. His own bad luck for being so shameless.
They were preparing to leave the restaurant when Mac Cartwright appeared, wearing a mortified expression.
"Ian, Jay—please, could I have a moment? I cannot begin to express how appalled I am by Zac's behaviour last night. He was terminated immediately, first thing this morning. There's absolutely no excuse for such conduct, and it reflects terribly on my leadership."
Jay felt his cheeks burn with embarrassment at the public nature of the apology. Ian remained stone-faced, clearly unimpressed by the gesture.
"I understand your position, but—"
"Please. Give me a chance to prove our company's integrity isn't defined by one man's inexcusable behaviour. We have a scheduled visit to our tech lab this morning—let me show you the innovation we're truly about."
Ian glanced at Jay, who nodded despite his discomfort. "I'm fine with that," Jay said.
"Very well, I suppose we could proceed with the morning appointment," Ian replied.
The tech lab was an hour's drive outside the city, a gleaming facility that buzzed with activity even on Saturday. They received a tour that showcased cutting-edge development projects, ending in Mac presenting Jay with an unexpected gift.
"This is a prototype of our latest design. Impossible to purchase, limited to fifty units worldwide. Ultra-lightweight but incredibly durable, with specifications that won't be commercially available for another two years."
Jay stared at the device. "I can't possibly accept this."
"Please. It's a sincere apology for the unacceptable treatment you received. Consider it a small gesture toward making amends. It's the least we can do after such an unforgivable breach of hospitality."
Jay looked helplessly at Ian, who appeared more amused than anything else by Jay's obvious discomfort with the lavish gesture.
"It's entirely up to you whether you choose to forgive them," Ian said solemnly.
Jay caught Ian's barely concealed mirth and rolled his eyes at Ian's feigned gravity before accepting the laptop with as much grace as he could muster. The deal, apparently, was saved.
Back at the hotel after lunch, Ian reminded Jay of his promise. "Time for that shopping expedition. We have siblings to satisfy."
"You don't have to do this," Jay said, feeling sheepish about the entire enterprise.
"Nonsense. A promise is a promise."
Ian insisted they visit the city's most impressive shopping complex. The mall was enormous, a testament to New Continent excess, with stores Jay had only heard of in magazines.
Ian guided him through specialty confectionery shops, toy stores with elaborate displays, electronics boutiques with the latest gadgets. At a cosmetics counter, a helpful clerk assembled a bag of trendy makeup for Ema without Jay even knowing what half the products were for.
"Company card for everything," Ian insisted when Jay reached for his wallet. "Leo needs to cover expenses for his meddling."
They also sent postcards—Jay writing brief messages to each sibling while Ian waited patiently nearby.
By the time they returned to the hotel, Jay was exhausted and laden with shopping bags, staring at the collection with dismay.
"How am I going to fit all this in my suitcase?"
"Don't worry about logistics. I'll handle the packing arrangements."
That evening, Ian took Jay to dinner at a restaurant that occupied the top floor of the city's tallest building. The view was spectacular, the food exceptional.
"This place has insane waiting times," Ian explained as they were seated at a table. "Nearly impossible to get into. But I still have some strings to pull, despite everything. Since we're here, it would be a pity not to take advantage."
Jay was once again grateful for his tailored clothes—at least he didn't stand out among the other diners, all of whom looked wealthy and sophisticated.
"How do you find the New Continent?" Ian asked over dessert.
"Impressive, but overwhelming. I doubt they need quite this many lanes and highways everywhere. And the parking lots are the size of small towns. They could use more green spaces—I much prefer the parks back home."
"I don't disagree. It's not really to my taste either. Too loud, too big for its own good."
"I'm glad the deal didn't fall through after all. It would have felt awkward to have my first business trip end in failure."
"It wouldn't have been a failure. Determining that a company isn't a good partner is valuable information, often more so than pushing for any deal regardless of the circumstances."
Jay had to concede the point, impressed once again by Ian's wisdom and principled approach to business. 
They left the restaurant while it was still early evening, knowing they had to wake at four in the morning for their flight home. Jay packed, setting out his more casual clothes for the morning travel, but despite his exhaustion, he couldn't fall asleep.
It had been an intense trip—successful but emotionally complicated. Jay lay in the hotel bed, processing the business dealings, the uncomfortable incident, and through it all, Ian's unexpected protectiveness.
Two days had shown him more of the world than he'd seen in his entire previous life, but they'd also revealed depths to his connection with Ian that made him increasingly uncertain about the true nature of their relationship.
Scene 5
Journey Home
The alarm at four-thirty felt like a cruel joke. Jay woke feeling like he'd been hit by a train, his body heavy with exhaustion despite going to bed early. The poor sleep had left him sluggish and disoriented, moving through the morning on autopilot.
He cleaned up, packed the remainder of his belongings, and checked the hotel room five times to ensure nothing was forgotten—documents in order, passport secured, chargers packed, toiletries accounted for. By five minutes to five, he dragged himself to the lobby where Ian waited, looking composed, his luggage already loaded in the waiting car.
While Ian appeared immaculate, Jay felt like a zombie. The drive to the airport passed in silence, Jay slumping against the leather seat, half-awake.
Ian guided him through the airport procedures. Jay barely registered the process, noting dimly that they seemed to have more bags than when they'd arrived—presumably containing yesterday's shopping haul.
At the terminal, an announcement crackled through the speakers about weather delays. Jay didn't catch the details, too exhausted to focus.
They found seats in an airport café, Ian returning with coffee and asking gently, "Do you feel like breakfast?"
Jay fumbled with the toast and eggs they ordered, managing only a few bites before giving up. Ian watched with growing concern, finally probing softly.
"Is something wrong? Beyond the obvious exhaustion, I mean."
Jay sighed deeply. "How is it possible that you're so put together despite this demanding schedule and the jetlag? I can barely function."
Ian laughed. "Years of practice. I've been flying regularly for over thirty years—it does get easier once you adapt to the demands."
Another announcement declared a two-hour delay. Jay groaned audibly.
"We were supposed to arrive at nine. Now it's eleven, and I won't be home before midnight. I'll have trouble getting up for work tomorrow."
"You don't need to come in. Business travel grants you a recovery day."
"Will you be coming in?"
Ian hesitated. "I will, yes."
"Then I'll come too."
"Jay, you don't need to force yourself—"
"If you can manage it, so can I."
Ian relented, sensing it might be a matter of pride, but privately worried about Jay pushing himself too hard. They moved to the business class lounge, where Jay collapsed onto a relatively comfortable bench and immediately dozed off, the coffee having done little to combat his exhaustion.
Ian watched over him, fighting the urge to smooth the hair from Jay's forehead or adjust the awkward angle of his neck. Jay drifted in and out of consciousness, looking young and vulnerable.
Another announcement woke Jay: the delay had increased to four hours. Jay groaned, but Ian smiled.
"Flight delays happen. They're not exactly rare. Consider it a learning experience—whenever you plan to fly, it's wise to anticipate possible delays. At least it happened on the return journey."
They returned to the café for more coffee, Jay looking marginally more alert. As they sat overlooking the terminal's bustle, Jay's expression grew wistful.
"Something bothering you?" Ian asked.
Jay's defenses were lowered by exhaustion and the strange feeling of displacement. "I'll never get used to this high-stakes society. Never stop being an imposter. As much as I enjoy and appreciate the opportunities, each one just showcases my own limitations," he blurted out.
"That's not true, is it? People are the same regardless of how they were born—some are kind, some are not. If anything, wealth and power tend to make people worse, not better. As you saw firsthand this week, being rich and successful doesn't automatically make someone deserving of respect. Kindness and integrity matter—everything else is superficial. The clothes, the manners, the insider knowledge—none of that measures a person's worth."
"I suppose. But it's hard when people higher in the hierarchy harass or insult me."
"Is it easier when someone poor harasses and insults you?"
Jay paused, thinking of various unpleasant encounters with peers over the years. Was his pride less wounded then? "No," he admitted. "I feel small no matter who it comes from."
"Exactly. Harassment is the harasser's fault, not yours. It doesn't matter if you're disparaged by a tailor, an executive, or a janitor—they're behaving badly, and it says nothing about your value. Harassment isn't more valid coming from wealthy people, just as poverty doesn't automatically make someone kind."
Jay pondered it. Maybe Ian was right. Perhaps he'd been paying too much attention to status, judging people by bank accounts and not actions. Once again, Ian's wisdom impressed him, and he looked at him with undisguised admiration.
"I tend to get lost in my head about perceived inadequacies," Jay admitted sheepishly.
"There's nothing inadequate about you at all." Ian's voice held such conviction that Jay felt heat rush to his cheeks, his gaze dropping to the floor. Praise from Ian always felt monumental.
The delay stretched to six hours. They ate an early lunch in the lounge, and Jay consumed four cups of coffee before he finally felt awake.
"Now I won't be able to sleep at all," Jay moaned as they boarded the plane.
Takeoff was less exciting the second time, and cloud cover limited the view from his window. 
"Maybe this time we'll actually manage to watch that movie," Ian joked, and they did attempt it, but they both found the comedy decidedly unfunny. They switched to a historical drama that Jay loved and Ian found absolutely terrible.
"The costumes are beautiful," Jay protested as Ian criticized the production values.
"Cheap, fake, and melodramatic," Ian countered, though he seemed amused by Jay's enthusiasm.
After plane dinner, Jay finally managed to nap, waking just before landing at three in the morning. Even Ian looked tired now.
"Now even I won't come to work Monday," Ian admitted. "Feel free to take the day off and rest properly."
The driver took Jay home first. Ian handed him the additional suitcase containing the siblings' gifts, and Jay struggled to manage everything up to his small apartment. The luggage and new clothes made the space feel impossibly crowded—he clearly couldn't delay his apartment search any longer.
Despite his exhaustion, Jay fell into bed feeling happy. The trip had been intense, challenging, and occasionally uncomfortable, but Ian had been beside him through every moment. Whatever complexities existed in their relationship, Jay's fundamental assessment remained unchanged.
Ian was the best person he'd ever known, and working for him remained the greatest privilege of Jay's life.
