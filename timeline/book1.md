| 1 | Things set in motion | 1 | The gift | Leo visits Ian's office and convinces him to hire Jay Hall as his new assistant, despite Ian's deep mistrust stemming from the Sam Connelly corporate spy betrayal thirteen years ago. Ian reluctantly agrees, knowing he owes Leo for saving his career after the scandal destroyed his life. | 1 day | Jul 29, 2017 | Saturday | |
| 1 | Things set in motion | 2 | Arrival | Jay arrives at Turner & Associates twenty minutes early for his first day, overwhelmed by the opulence and thrilled by the opportunity.

| 1 | Things set in motion | 3 | Introduction | Ian meets Jay and introduces him to the team — Amy, Luc, Ela, Zoe, and Kim — while internally comparing Jay's earnest behavior to Sam Connelly's calculated charm.

| 1 | Things set in motion | 4 | Settling in | Jay settles into his role over Tuesday and Wednesday, learning the coffee machine from Luc, receiving a leather messenger bag from Leo, and completing client summaries.

| 1 | Things set in motion | 5 | Signals | Jay completes his first week with growing confidence, appreciating Ian's constructive feedback and the complete absence of unwanted attention. The team gossips about whether Jay is here for the job or for Ian, while Ian grants Jay access to his email and calendar — and remains convinced Jay's enthusiasm is either innocent or manipulative. | 1 day | Aug 4, 2017 | Friday | Jay completes first week; gains access to Ian's email/calendar |
