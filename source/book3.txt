Clouds Over Gethsemane

Affection
Chapter 41: New traditions
Scene 1
Companions
Thursday morning felt different before Jay even opened his eyes. The light streaming through his bedroom window seemed brighter. Two years. Today marked exactly two years since he'd walked into Turner & Associates, hopeful, terrified, and desperate.
He got up and showered. The mirror showed someone he almost didn't recognise—still pale, still soft-featured, but no longer hunched with anxiety. The apartment around him was proof of how far he'd come. His home.
As he buttoned his shirt, his hands slowed. The memory surfaced without permission: Ian's arms around him yesterday, holding him together when everything felt like it was falling apart. The warmth of that embrace had taken root somewhere deep inside him, out of his reach.
Jay grabbed his bag and left before he could think about it anymore.
The office was empty when he arrived, the overhead lights still dim in standby mode. Jay stood in the reception area for a moment, letting the cool air wash over him. The layout stretched before him—neatly arranged desks, the glass walls of Ian's office, the kitchen area where they'd shared countless coffees.
With Gal gone, the space felt breathable again. No more watching his back, no more calculating safe routes through the floor.
He moved to his workstation and set down his bag. Everything was exactly as he needed it. Ian had made sure he was comfortable from the beginning, even when he'd been cold and suspicious. Even then, the care had been there.
Jay pulled up his calendar and started reviewing the day's schedule. Meetings, reports, a conference call in the afternoon. Normal and manageable.
The distant chime of the elevator broke the silence. Jay looked up. Morning light poured through the panoramic windows, rendering everything in sharp summer light: the empty desks, the geometric shadows, Ian walking toward him through bands of brightness and shade. 
For a moment Jay saw him as a stranger might—the composure, the expensive clothes, the way he walked like someone accustomed to being watched. Then their eyes met, and Ian became simply Ian again.
"Good morning," Ian said. He paused briefly and touched the edge of Jay's desk before he continued toward his office.
"Morning," Jay replied.
The word felt ordinary. Jay turned back to his screen and felt his anxiety loosen slightly. With Ian here, the difficulties of recent days seemed more bearable.
The gossip about Gal's firing had already faded. A week was apparently long enough for the story to lose its freshness. New hires acting out wasn't unheard of, and security's swift response had closed the matter cleanly. For most people, it was just another incident in the office's history, barely worth mentioning.
Jay found comfort in that. The world kept turning. He wasn't a spectacle.
He worked through his tasks determined to project normalcy. Ian was already shaken enough. The last thing Jay wanted was to add to that burden, to make Ian feel like he had to keep protecting him. Gal's behaviour had dampened the entire office atmosphere for weeks—Jay refused to become another source of tension.
His calendar reminder chimed. Morning briefing.
Jay gathered his tablet and notes, then crossed to Ian's office. Through the glass wall, he could see Ian at his desk. Even after two years, the sight still was unreal. This brilliant man had become the center of Jay's entire world.
Jay knocked lightly on the doorframe.
Ian looked up. "Come in. How are you feeling today?"
"I'm good. Ready to tackle the day."
"You slept well?"
"Well enough. What's on the agenda for today?"
"Standard tasks. Let's go through the schedule."
They moved through the briefing. Jay reported on the progress of various projects, flagged potential issues, confirmed meeting times. Ian listened with complete attention, interjecting questions. On the surface, everything appeared normal.
But Jay could see the tension in Ian's shoulders that shouldn't have been there. Ian was worried about him, Jay realized. Still worried, despite Jay's best efforts to appear fine.
And because Jay was watching so closely, he could also see Ian making the same effort in reverse—trying to project calm, trying to be the pillar Jay could lean on. They were both performing, and they both knew it.
"Jay. If you need time—"
"I don't. I mean, thank you, but I'm okay. Really."
"This kind of situation takes time to process. There's no shame in that."
"I know. And I appreciate you saying it. But honestly, being here, working—it helps. It reminds me that things are normal again."
"All right. But the offer stands. Any time you need it."
"I know," Jay said again, and meant it with everything he had.
For a moment they just sat there, looking at each other across the desk. This, Jay thought. These moments of connection, of mutual understanding and care—they were worth the pain, worth every difficult moment that had led here.
"We should get started on the projections. The board will want preliminary numbers by next week," Ian said finally.
"I'll pull the data this afternoon. Anything else you need right now?"
"No, that's everything. Thank you, Jay."
Jay headed for the door, then paused with his hand on the frame. He looked back. Ian was already refocusing on his screen, but his posture had relaxed slightly, the tension in his shoulders less pronounced.
They were both trying, and both seeing through each other's efforts. 
Around three, Luc appeared at his desk. "Break time."
"What's up?"
Luc pulled over a spare chair and sat down. "Just wanted to check in. See how you're doing."
Luc had always been good at that—caring without making it uncomfortable. 
"I'm okay. Better than last week, definitely."
"Yeah?"
"Yeah. It still bothers me, honestly. The whole situation. But it's getting easier. Each day feels a bit lighter."
"For what it's worth, you handled everything really well. Better than most people would have."
"I don't know about that."
"I do. And I'm glad you're feeling better. But seriously, if you need anything—"
"I know. Thank you for checking."
Luc nodded and headed back to his own desk. People cared. That still felt strange to accept, but it was getting easier.
Most of the office cleared out by six. Jay kept working, Ian's office light still glowing behind its glass walls. At seven-thirty, Jay finished compiling the preliminary data Ian had requested. He saved everything then gathered his tablet and headed to Ian's office.
Ian looked up as Jay knocked. "Come in. Is that the projection data?"
"Initial numbers. I'll need to verify a few sources tomorrow, but this should give you a working framework."
"Thank you. We should head out. It's getting late."
They gathered their things and headed for the exit. The building was mostly empty at this hour, their footsteps echoing in the lobby. The elevator arrived and they stepped inside. Jay pressed the button, then leaned against the wall, suddenly aware of how tired he was. 
"Jay. Would you like to have dinner? If you don't have other plans."
The question surprised Jay. Not because it was strange—they'd had dinner together many times, but those had always been business dinners, client meetings, work functions. This felt different. There was slight uncertainty in Ian's voice when he asked.
"I don't have plans. Dinner sounds good."
"There's a cosy pasta place not far from here. Does that work?"
"Yeah."
The restaurant was understated but clearly upscale. The host recognized Ian and led them to a table. They ordered—pasta for Jay, fish for Ian, wine that Ian selected after a brief consultation with their server.
"I wanted to say something," Ian began once their wine arrived. He turned the glass slowly between his fingers. "It's been two years since you became my assistant. I wanted to thank you for continuing to work with me despite how difficult things have been."
"Ian—"
"Let me finish. When you first arrived, I made things harder than they needed to be, and you had every reason to leave. But you stayed. You worked hard and you built a place here. And then, just when things should have been easier, you had to deal with harassment again."
"That wasn't your fault."
"No. But it happened on my watch, to someone under my protection. To someone I—" Ian stopped, seeming to reconsider his words. "To someone I care about very much. I know it had to be difficult enduring that situation."
"It does still bother me. More than I want it to. But not for the reasons you might think."
"What do you mean?"
"The harassment itself was awful, obviously. But what really gets to me is how badly I misjudged her. I thought Gal was harmless. I completely misread the situation until it was almost too late. That's what keeps circling in my head—how wrong I was."
"You weren't wrong to give her the benefit of the doubt initially. That's not a failure of judgment. It's human decency."
"Maybe. But I should have seen it sooner."
"Predatory behavior is designed to be difficult to identify until it escalates. The fault lies entirely with Gal, not with your perception. You responded appropriately once the situation became clear."
"I'm glad it was resolved so quickly. That security took it seriously, that the company acted immediately. I know that doesn't always happen."
"It should always happen. And I wish it hadn't needed to happen at all. I wish I'd seen the warning signs earlier, been more proactive in protecting you."
"You can't prevent every bad thing."
"No. But I can try."
"Thank you for listening. For letting me complain about it."
"Any time you need to."
Their food arrived, breaking the moment. The conversation moved to more mundane topics.
By the time they finished dinner, Jay felt lighter. The tightness that had lived in his shoulders for the past week had finally eased. Speaking honestly about his feelings, having Ian listen without judgment—it had helped more than Jay had realized it would.
Ian paid the bill despite Jay's protest, and they walked back to the car through the warm evening air.
"Thank you for dinner," Jay said as they drove back toward their neighborhood. "I needed that."
"So did I. It felt good, just having dinner together. As companions, not as boss and assistant."
When Ian pulled up outside Jay's building, Jay was reluctant to leave the cocoon of the car, this small space where everything felt simpler.
"Good night, Ian."
"Good night, Jay. I'll see you tomorrow."
Jay got out and watched Ian drive the short distance to his own building. Then he headed inside and entered his apartment.
The evening replayed in his mind. Ian's words, the warmth in his eyes, the way he'd said "companions" like it meant something. The way the entire evening had felt like something more than what they were to each other.
Jay pressed his hand against his chest, feeling his heart beat beneath his palm.
He'd survived two years, built a life, found a place. And somewhere along the way, he'd fallen completely in love with the person who'd made it all possible.
Scene 2
Obvious favouritism
The gym was moderately busy on Saturday morning, the weekend regulars scattered across equipment. Jay spotted Rus immediately, demonstrating something to another client with animated gestures.
Rus caught sight of Jay and waved him over. "Give me two minutes," he called.
Jay set down his bag and started stretching, working through the warm-up that had become second nature over the past year. Rus appeared beside him. 
"All right, ready? How are you feeling today?"
"A little soreness in my shoulders, but nothing bad."
"Good. We'll focus on legs. So how was your week? You look tired."
"Long week."
"Work stuff?"
"Yeah."
They worked through the first set, Rus watching Jay's form, calling out corrections when needed. But once they moved to the next exercise, Rus circled back to the topic.
"Long week good or long week bad?"
Jay hesitated. He'd gotten better at opening up, but some things still felt too personal to discuss. Except Rus was looking at him with concern, and the gym was safe territory, and maybe talking about it one more time would help.
"Bad. But it's getting better now."
"What happened?"
So Jay told him. Not everything, but the essential facts. A coworker who'd become inappropriately fixated. Escalating behaviour. A false accusation that security had quickly disproven. The coworker's immediate termination.
Rus stopped entirely. "Wait. Hold on. Someone harassed you at work?"
"Yes."
"And then accused you of something you didn't do?"
"Yes."
"What the—" Rus's expression cycled through shock and fury in rapid succession. "Jay, that's insane. Are you okay? Is this person gone? Did they face actual consequences?"
"She was fired immediately. Security reviewed everything, saw it was false, and she was escorted out that day. It was handled properly."
"And you didn't say anything? You've been dealing with this alone?"
"Not alone. My boss and the company took it seriously. I had support."
"That's awful, Jay. I can't believe someone would do that to you. You're like the least threatening person I know."
"I misjudged her completely. I thought she was just annoying. I didn't see how bad it was getting until it was almost too late."
"This is heavy, man. You shouldn't just sit with it. We should drink it off. Tonight. My place. I'll order food, we'll get properly drunk, and you can tell me exactly what you want to say to this Gal woman and I'll agree with every word."
It was tempting. The idea of getting drunk and venting everything to someone who wouldn't judge or worry or try to fix things sounded good.
"I have an appointment this afternoon."
"Cancel it."
"I can't. It's the tailor appointment Leo arranged as a birthday gift. It's already been scheduled for weeks."
"A tailor appointment is more important than your mental health?"
"It's about obligation. Leo went through trouble to arrange it. I can't just not show up."
"Leo would understand."
"Maybe. But I'd still feel terrible about it. I appreciate the offer, really. But I've had support. Good support. Ian's been there. Luc checked on me. I'm doing better than I was."
"Fine. But if you change your mind, if you need anything—drinks, distraction, someone to yell at this woman's general direction—you call me. Any time."
"I will."
They finished the workout with Rus being noticeably gentler, his concern manifesting as attention to Jay's form and frequent check-ins about how he was feeling. By the time Jay headed home, he felt better. Lighter, the same way he'd felt after dinner with Ian. Talking helped. Having people care helped. He was still learning that lesson.
The tailor's shop was located in a neighbourhood where the buildings were old and elegant, and the prices were displayed only upon request. Jay had been here three times before, and each visit had left him feeling small and inadequate. He stood outside for a moment, gathering himself, then pushed open the door.
The interior was hushed and immaculate. A staff member appeared immediately. The same man as before, tall and thin with silver hair and an expression as if he’d he smelled something unpleasant.
"Mr. Hall?"
"Yes."
"Welcome. Mr. Turner arranged everything. Please, follow me."
Jay followed him to the back, where the actual fitting room waited. The same setup as before—raised platform, three-way mirrors that showed every angle, harsh lighting that somehow managed to be both cold and revealing. The head tailor stood waiting with his assistant, both looking offended.
"We have your measurements on file. We'll need to confirm them and discuss details."
The tailor circled him slowly, measuring tape in hand. He made disapproving sounds as he worked, noting measurements on a tablet.
"Arms up, please."
Jay raised his arms. The tape measure encircled his chest, then his waist. Jay kept his eyes on the middle distance, avoiding the mirrors. He turned when instructed, answered questions about comfort and fit. The assistant made notes. Neither of them engaged in small talk.
It was humiliating in small ways. The way the assistant handled the clothes as if they were too good for the person wearing them. The constant reminders that this world of bespoke tailoring and expensive fabric existed for people born into it, not for people like Jay who were just visiting.
But Jay endured it. He stood straight, answered politely, didn't let the discomfort show on his face. A year ago, this would have sent him spiraling into questions about his worth, his place, whether he deserved any of the good things in his life.
Now? It was just unpleasant. A rude tailor was just a rude tailor. Their condescension said more about them than it did about him.
"We'll have the suits ready in three weeks. We'll contact you to schedule a final fitting."
"Thank you."
Jay left the shop and walked back into the afternoon heat. He found a bench in the shade and sat for a moment, letting the tension drain from his shoulders. The experience would never be pleasant, and he'd made peace with that.
Jay spent the rest of the afternoon cleaning his apartment. He was halfway through when someone knocked on his door. He opened it to find Leo standing in the hallway, holding a bottle of champagne.
"We have very important matters to discuss and I brought champagne because champagne makes everything better," Leo announced, walking past Jay without waiting for an invitation.
"What's going on?"
Leo set the champagne on the kitchen counter, m pulling glasses from the kitchen cabinet as though he'd been there a hundred times before. "Ian's fortieth birthday in September. We're going to throw him the most magnificent party this city has ever seen."
"Ian doesn't like surprises. He definitely doesn't like elaborate parties. This is a terrible idea. He will be deeply uncomfortable while surrounded by people he doesn't particularly want to see."
"Ian needs this. He needs to be celebrated. He needs to be reminded that people care about him, that he's valued. When was the last time someone threw him a proper party?"
"There's probably a reason for that."
"The reason is that everyone's too afraid to try. Everyone tiptoes around him like he's made of glass. But he's not. He's just... He's lonely. And he doesn't even realize it. A party would be good for him."
"Even if that's true, I don't think I should be involved in planning it."
"Why not?"
"Because it feels invasive. It feels like I'm going behind his back. Ian trusts me. I don't want to betray that trust by plotting surprise parties he explicitly wouldn't want."
"Jay, I've known Ian for decades. I've seen him at his worst. I've seen him isolated and bitter and convinced he has to face everything alone. He's gotten better since you arrived, but he's still that person underneath, convinced he doesn't deserve good things. Waiting for everything to fall apart."
Jay knew what Leo meant. He'd seen glimpses of that—the way Ian sometimes seemed surprised by kindness.
"A party won't fix that," Jay said.
"No. But it might remind him that people want to celebrate him anyway. That he matters to more than just the bottom line of Turner & Associates. Look, I'm not asking you to plan the whole thing. I'm asking you to help me gauge whether he'd actually want this. To test the waters. You're closer to him than anyone. If you tell me it would make him miserable, I'll reconsider."
Jay drank some of his champagne. It was excellent, crisp and dry. He thought about Ian spending his birthday alone, probably working, maybe having a polite dinner with Leo because tradition demanded it. About Ian believing that was all he deserved.
"I don't like this," Jay said finally.
"Noted."
"I'm not promising anything. I'll ask some questions, see how he feels about it. But if I get even the slightest indication that he'd hate a party, you're dropping it."
"Deal. I knew I could count on you. You're the only one Ian actually listens to."
"That's not true."
"It absolutely is. Ian values your opinion more than anyone else's. If you tell him a celebration is a good idea, he'll actually consider it. If I tell him, he'll just roll his eyes and ignore me."
Jay felt heat rise in his face. "You're exaggerating."
"I'm really not. But we can debate Ian's obvious favouritism another time. Thank you. For caring enough about Ian to go along with this. I know he matters to you."
They finished the champagne with Leo outlining elaborate party plans that Jay mostly ignored. By the time Leo finally left it was nearly ten o'clock and Jay was exhausted. He sank onto the couch, processing the conversation. Leo had noticed how much Ian mattered to Jay.
That shouldn't have been surprising. Jay had never been subtle about his feelings, at least in terms of how much he cared about Ian's well-being. He just hadn't realized it was quite so obvious to outside observers.
But setting that aside—did he want to help plan this celebration? The manipulative aspect still bothered him. Ian deserved to have choices about his own life, including how he spent his birthday.
On the other hand, Leo was right about one thing. Ian never expected recognition or celebration. He gave so much to everyone around him and accepted so little in return.
Jay thought about Ian's expression at dinner on Thursday. The way he'd thanked Jay for staying, for trusting him, for being part of his life. The warmth in his eyes when he'd called them companions. Ian deserved to see that people cared about him, that he mattered. Even if he'd never ask for that confirmation himself.
Scene 3
Vanilla and spices
The office was empty by seven on Monday evening. Jay sat at his desk with a cooling cup of coffee, watching Ian review projections on his laptop. He had been trying to find an opening for the past twenty minutes.
Finally, he gathered his tablet and walked to Ian's office, knocking lightly on the door frame. "Do you have a minute?"
Ian looked up. "Of course. Come in."
Jay entered, closed the door behind him and sat in one of the chairs across from Ian's desk.
"I wanted to discuss something. It's not work-related."
"Alright."
"It's about your birthday."
"What about it?"
"Leo wants to throw you a party. A real celebration, with people from the office and maybe others you know."
"Of course he does. Let me guess—he's already started planning."
"He might have some ideas. But he wanted me to ask how you felt about it first. If you're opposed to the whole thing, I can tell him to back off."
"Can you? I've known Leo for years. Backing off isn't in his vocabulary."
"I'll make him. I'll—" Jay paused, recognizing the impossibility of that promise. "I'll try very hard."
"Leo asked you to convince me."
"He asked me to test the waters. To see how you felt about it. I told him if you didn't want it, I'd make sure he backed off. And I meant that. I'll pacify Leo or die trying if you'd rather skip the whole thing. But I think it might be good for you. To be celebrated, I mean. To have people gather because they want to acknowledge that you matter to them. I enjoyed my own party. It felt nice to have friends and family there, to see that people cared enough to show up. But if you don't want that, if the idea makes you uncomfortable, then I completely understand. I'll tell Leo to drop it, and I'll keep telling him until he actually listens."
"You're very concerned about my well-being."
"Of course I am. You've done a lot for me. The least I can do is make sure you're not forced into something you'd hate."
"I don't particularly enjoy parties. Especially ones centred around me. They feel performative. Obligatory."
"I understand. I'll tell Leo—"
"But I appreciate the thought behind it. And if you think it might be worthwhile, I'm willing to consider it."
"You are?"
"Tell Leo he can do whatever he wants. Within reason. I'm not wearing a party hat, and there better not be any speeches."
"That's fair. Thank you. I think it will be good. I'll make sure it's good."
"I believe you. Now, should we actually finish this projection, or are we both too distracted?"
They worked for another hour. Ian watched Jay from his office, the smile Jay couldn't quite hide. Jay cared about him. He worried about his comfort and wanted him to be happy. That tenderness was almost unbearable in its sweetness. Ian would endure any party, no matter how uncomfortable, if it meant seeing Jay look that pleased and hopeful.
When they finally packed up, Ian drove Jay home. It was becoming commonplace now, these late evenings followed by car rides.
"Thank you," Jay said when they pulled up to his building.
"For what?"
"For saying yes. To the party."
"You're welcome."
Jay entered his apartment and pulled out his phone to text Leo: "He agreed. Plan your party. But keep it reasonable."
The response came within seconds: "I KNEW IT. You're a miracle worker."
Jay sat on his couch and stared at the ceiling. His mind was already racing ahead to the next problem: what to get Ian for his birthday.
Something thoughtful. Something that would show how much Jay cared without making things uncomfortable. The problem was that Ian had everything. Anything Jay could afford to buy, Ian could buy himself ten times over without thinking about the cost.
Jay cycled through possibilities. Books? Art? He didn't know enough about Ian's tastes to choose well. Electronics? Same problem—Ian's standards were too high and his means too extensive.
An experience, maybe? Tickets to something? But what did Ian actually enjoy that he wasn't already doing?
Jay pulled out his laptop and started researching, looking for inspiration. Concert tickets, museum exhibitions, sporting events—all of it felt too impersonal.
Hours passed. Jay's search history became increasingly desperate. "Gifts for people who have everything." "Thoughtful birthday presents." "Meaningful gifts for men."
Nothing felt right.
He was about to give up for the night when a memory surfaced. Years ago, back in his small town, his grandfather had made tinctures and liqueurs. Jay remembered the big glass jars lined up on shelves, the measuring of spices and fruits, the sweet smell of alcohol and sugar. His grandfather would bottle them at Christmas, giving them away to neighbours and friends with handwritten labels.
Ian liked good alcohol. That much Jay knew. He had refined tastes, appreciated quality. The idea took shape slowly. Homemade infusions—different flavours, bottled and labeled. It wasn't expensive in terms of money, but it required time and care. Was it too simple? Too plebeian for someone like Ian?
Jay stared at his laptop screen, uncertain. He didn't have much time—the party was in just over a month. If he was going to do this, he needed to start soon.
But what if Ian found it cheap? What if homemade gifts came across as childish or inappropriate?
Jay chewed his lip, then made a decision. He'd start the project. Order the supplies, begin the infusions, see how they turned out. In the meantime, he'd keep thinking about alternatives. If he came up with something better, he could always abandon this plan.
He opened several online shops in new tabs and started adding items to carts. Large glass jars for steeping. Smaller bottles for the final product. Funnels, strainers, labels. He'd need base liquors and fruits and spices. Vanilla beans, citrus, berries, herbs.
By the time he finished ordering, his kitchen was going to look like a small distillery.
Jay completed the purchases and closed his laptop, still uncertain but committed. At worst, he'd have wasted some money and time. At best, he'd give Ian something no one else would think to make. Something that said, without words, how much Ian mattered to him.
The next morning, Jay arrived at the office to find Ian already at his desk. They had a meeting scheduled at ten to review the remaining candidates for Gal's replacement. Jay brought his notes and sat down in Ian's office.
"I have three candidates marked as strong possibilities. The first candidate has excellent technical skills but limited experience with financial analysis. The second has the experience but seems overqualified for the position. The third—"
"Tia Larson," Ian said, tapping one of the files. "She was your third choice?"
"Yes. Ex-military, moved here last year, strong administrative background. She interviewed well—very direct, no nonsense approach. You had her on your list too."
"If we both thought she was a good match, the odds of being wrong are smaller," Ian said.
Jay read the file again, trying to see any red flags he might have missed. Nothing stood out. She'd been polite in the interview and answered questions directly. No warning signs. No uncomfortable moments. But then, there hadn't been any with Gal either.
"I think she's a good choice, but I'll be more vigilant this time."
"Jay—"
"I'm not blaming myself. I'm just being realistic. If there are problems, I'll catch them earlier."
"If there are problems, we'll handle them together. I'll contact HR today, start the hiring process. If everything goes smoothly, she can start in a few weeks."
They returned to work, but Jay couldn't shake the anxiety that had crept in. Another unknown variable. Another chance for things to go terribly wrong. He pushed the thoughts aside and focused on the tasks at hand. There was nothing to be gained from worrying about problems that hadn't happened yet.
It was the middle of summer, vacation season in full swing. Max and Zoe were both gone, traveling somewhere with good weather and outdoor activities. But Ray and Liv had taken to their roles with impressive competence, handling tasks that would have required overtime in previous years. The vacation period didn't mean brutal hours and mounting stress. The work got done. The office ran smoothly without grinding anyone down.
The breathing room gave Jay time for his secret project.
After work on Tuesday, he stopped at a specialty liquor store across town, loading his cart with several bottles of high-quality spirits. Wednesday took him to a gourmet market where he bought vanilla beans, dried lavender, whole spices. Thursday meant the farmer's market for fresh berries and citrus.
He converted his kitchen into a workspace. Glass jars lined his kitchen counter, each one filled with vodka and precisely measured ingredients. Orange peel and cardamom in one. Raspberries and vanilla in another. Coffee beans in a third. The smells mixed together—sharp alcohol undercut with fruit and spice.
Jay had labeled each jar with its contents and the date, mimicking his grandfather's record-keeping. Now came the hard part: waiting. The infusions needed time to develop, weeks of steeping before they'd be ready to strain and bottle.
Friday evening, Ian appeared at Jay's desk at six.
"Let's call it a week. We've done enough," Ian said.
Jay gathered his things, surprised but pleased. There was something nice about ending the week early, the whole weekend stretching ahead. They got into the car and Ian pulled out into traffic.
"Have you eaten?" Ian asked.
"Not yet. I was going to make something when I got home."
"There's a place near here. Would you want to have dinner?"
Jay's heart did a somersault in his chest. "Yes. I'd like that."
Ian took them to a different restaurant this time, a casual place with outdoor seating and a menu focused on grilled vegetables and fresh bread. They sat at a table under a green awning, protected from the late sun.
The food arrived quickly—roasted vegetables and grilled fish, a basket of warm bread they shared between them. 
"What do you do on summer evenings?" Ian asked.
"I've been working out at home, but it's not the same as the gym. I've been trying to run, but I'm terrible at it. I can barely make it two blocks before I'm winded."
"That's normal when you're starting. It gets easier. We could run together, if you'd like. Tuesday evening after work, maybe. Nothing intense, build up your endurance gradually."
"You'd want to do that?"
"I would. It's better with a partner. Helps with accountability and pacing."
"Then yes. I'd like that. Fair warning—you'll probably have to go very slowly."
"That's fine. I could use some easier runs anyway."
When they finally finished and Ian paid—again ignoring Jay's protests—neither of them seemed eager to end the evening. They walked slowly back to the car, the city alive around them.
"Thank you for dinner," Jay said as they drove toward home. "This is becoming a habit."
"Is that bad?"
"No. Not at all. I like it."
"So do I. It's nice. Just spending time together. No agenda, no business purpose. Just—"
"Companionship," Jay finished.
"Yes. Exactly."
When Ian pulled up outside Jay's building, Jay was reluctant to leave again. The car felt like its own small world, separate from everything else, a space where things could be easier than they were in reality.
"See you Monday."
"Have a good weekend, Jay."
"You too."
Jay got out of the car and watched Ian drive away, the taillights disappearing around the corner. Then he went inside and leaned against the closed door. His kitchen still smelled like vanilla and spices. The bottles sat in the dark cabinet, infusing slowly, becoming something new.
Scene 4
Safe love
Rus greeted Jay with an appraising look before they'd even started warming up.
"You look better. More like yourself."
"I feel better. Things have calmed down at work."
"Good. That's really good. I'm glad. You were pretty rough last week."
"Yeah. But it passed faster than I thought it would."
"That's how it works sometimes. You brace for the worst and then life just keeps going. You ready to actually work today or should I take it easy on you?"
"Don't you dare take it easy."
"That's what I wanted to hear."
They worked through their whole plan—weights, cardio, core exercises. Rus pushed him hard but Jay kept up, feeling the burn in his muscles. His mind was clear. His body was responding.
"Same time next week?" Rus asked as they finished.
"Definitely."
Jay headed home thinking the world had regained its equilibrium. Work was manageable, his friends were supportive, and Ian—
Ian was there. Constant, reliable, increasingly present in Jay's daily life.
On Sunday afternoon, Jay sat on his couch with tea and a book. His mind kept drifting, circling back to the same subject it always returned to lately.
Ian.
He set the book aside and thought about it properly. About what he felt. About what it meant. He loved Ian. That much was undeniable. He wanted to be near him, to talk to him, to make him happy. But what did that love look like? What did it require?
The answer, he realized, was simpler than he'd feared. It required nothing. He didn't need Ian to love him back. He didn't need to change their relationship or push for something more. What they had now—these dinners, these late evenings working together, these small moments of closeness—it was enough.
He could never be with Ian romantically. The professional relationship made it impossible. The power dynamic made it inappropriate. And beyond all that, Ian was refined, cultured, someone who lived in a different world entirely. The idea that Ian might want someone like Jay in that way was absurd.
But realizing this, sitting with it fully, Jay discovered something unexpected. It didn't hurt the way he'd thought it would.
Maybe this was better. This way, he could enjoy what they had without fear, without the pressure of expectations or the terror of rejection. He could appreciate their growing companionship without worrying about what came next.
Being with a man had never interested him. Not before Ian. Jay had dated women before, brief relationships that had felt pleasant but never essential. He'd assumed he was just someone with a low sex drive, someone who didn't prioritize romance. The harassment from his first boss had reinforced that—physical intimacy felt threatening, something to avoid.
And now here he was, in love with a man. Which meant he was at least bisexual, he supposed. The label felt strange but accurate.
Though honestly, Jay realized he didn't want to think too hard about the physical realities. The mechanics of being with a man seemed intimidating, frankly terrifying in their specifics. Better not to dwell on it.
Except he did think about it. Constantly. Unwillingly. 
The two times they'd embraced—comfort and exhaustion, nothing romantic about either moment. But Jay remembered the warmth, the way Ian had held him like he was something precious. What would it be like to be touched by Ian with affection? With desire? The thought made his heart race. It made him feel simultaneously drawn forward and desperate to retreat.
He set down his cup and pressed his hands against his cheeks, willing the thoughts away. This was pointless. Worse than pointless—it was dangerous territory, the kind that led to wanting things he couldn't have. Better to focus on what was real. What they actually shared.
Jay moved to his kitchen, checking his jars of infusions. The liquids had already taken on colour from their ingredients, subtle changes that promised flavour. Something to occupy his hands, his mind.
What he wanted wasn't romance, he told himself firmly. It wasn't possession or exclusivity or any of the complicated entanglements that came with relationships. It was closeness. Warmth. More of what they already had. These new patterns they were building felt miraculous enough. He didn't dare ask for more.
And maybe the impossibility of anything physical was a relief. He could love Ian without having to confront the scary, intimate realities.
Safe love. Unrequited love. Love that didn't demand anything of him except to keep showing up, keep being present, keep caring. Jay could do that. He'd gotten very good at it already.
Monday evening, Jay and Ian sat in the office lounge with coffee, the building empty around them, taking a break from the financial reports that had consumed most of the day.
Jay had been thinking about something all afternoon, a question that had been nagging at him since the whole situation with Gal had finally resolved. Now, in this tranquil moment, it slipped out.
"Can I ask you something that might be embarrassing?"
Ian looked at him with immediate interest. "Of course."
"Was I ever as dramatic as Gal? I mean, when I first started. I remember asking questions about everything, trying to understand how things worked. And there was that time you told me I should focus on my own tasks instead of worrying about the bigger picture, and I got all mopey about it."
Jay cringed at the memory. He'd been so hurt by that rebuke, had taken it as confirmation that he was failing, that Ian saw him as incompetent. Looking back now with the perspective of time, his reaction seemed excessive. Dramatic, even. Like Gal's constant whining.
Ian stared at him for a moment, then laughed. Not a small chuckle but a full laugh that lit up his entire face. Jay was transfixed. He'd heard Ian laugh before, but seldom like this.
"Jay. You were the complete opposite. So self-effacing it took me months to get you to speak freely."
"But I asked all those questions—"
"You asked necessary questions to understand your job. That's completely different from seeking attention or creating drama. And that incident you mentioned, when I told you to focus on your own tasks? I was wrong. I was being defensive and suspicious, treating you like a threat when all you were doing was trying to do good work."
"I sulked."
"You went back to your desk and worked harder. That's not drama, Jay. Everything you did when you first started was designed to minimize your presence. You spoke quietly, sat in the back during meetings, apologized for things that weren't your fault. You tried to take up as little space as possible, to avoid causing any inconvenience. Gal was the opposite—constantly seeking attention, creating situations where she was the centre of focus. You were nothing like that."
"So I wasn't annoying?"
"You were never annoying. You were frightened and trying very hard to be perfect. Which broke my heart once I finally recognized it."
Jay looked at Ian, not sure how to respond.
"I should have been more accommodating from the start. I should have recognized that you needed reassurance. My behaviour made everything harder for you. That was my failure."
"You were protecting yourself. After what happened before, that makes sense."
"Perhaps. But it wasn't fair to you. And for what it's worth, watching you come into your own over these past two years has been one of the more rewarding aspects of working with you. You've exceeded every expectation I could have had."
Jay breathed easier. While Ian's description of his early behaviour wasn't exactly flattering, at least he hadn't been a burden.
And Ian's honest laughter had been beautiful. The kind of moment Jay wanted to collect and keep, evidence that Ian could be happy, that he could let his guard down completely.
"We should get back to those reports," Ian said eventually, though he didn't move.
"Probably," Jay agreed, equally stationary.
But for another few minutes, they just sat there, drinking their coffee, sharing the space. Together without needing to be anywhere else.
Jay thought about tomorrow, the run they'd planned. About the birthday party, the tinctures steeping in his kitchen, all the small ways their lives were intertwining more tightly.  He didn't need more. He just needed this to continue.
Scene 5
Running
Jay stood outside his building at eight on Tuesday, the summer air warm against his skin. The river smell drifted up, that particular blend of water and stone and city that marked August evenings. He was doing final stretches when Ian appeared, jogging down the street, and Jay forgot how to think.
Ian wore fitted athletic wear—dark compression pants and a shirt that showed every line of his athletic build. His hair was slightly disheveled from the jog over, his breathing was even despite the distance he must have covered.
Jay realized he was staring and forced his eyes away.
"Ready?" Ian asked, coming to a stop beside him.
"As I'll ever be," Jay replied.
"We'll take it easy. This is supposed to be enjoyable, not punishment."
"You say that now."
"I mean it. Set the pace you're comfortable with. We're not training for anything."
"This used to be my gym slot, you know. Now you're stealing it."
"Too late to give it back now."
They started at a light pace, heading toward the river path. Ian stayed beside Jay, adjusting his stride to match. The evening sun painted everything gold and amber, and the path was dotted with other runners and cyclists, everyone taking advantage of the pleasant weather.
"Keep your shoulders relaxed. You're tensing up," Ian said after the first few minutes.
Jay tried to adjust. "Like this?"
"Better. Focus on your breathing. In through your nose, out through your mouth."
Jay focused on breathing. On keeping his stride even. On not looking at Ian more than necessary, because every glance was a reminder of exactly how fit Ian was, how his body moved with grace that made Jay feel clumsy by comparison.
"You're doing fine. Don't try to go too fast. Just maintain a comfortable pace."
"This is comfortable?" Jay gasped.
"It will be. Give it a few weeks."
Ian kept up a stream of encouragement as they ran. His voice was warm and patient, the same tone he used when coaching Jay through complicated work tasks. They continued along the river path until the sky turned from gold to purple. Jay's lungs burned and his legs protested, but he kept going, driven by stubborn pride.
"Let's stop here," Ian said finally.
Jay nearly collapsed with relief. They slowed to a walk, then stopped at a bench overlooking the water. Jay sat heavily, his heart pounding. Ian sat beside him, barely winded, looking like he could run another ten kilometres without effort.
"That was terrible," Jay said between breaths.
"That was excellent for a first run together."
"I'm completely inefficient at cardio."
"You're doing fine. Better than fine, actually." Ian reached over and briefly touched Jay's shoulder, a gesture of reassurance that sent electricity through Jay's entire body. "I exercise seven days a week. My conditioning is the result of years of consistent work. You can't compare yourself to that."
"You're barely breathing hard."
"Give yourself credit. You kept the pace the whole time and didn't stop even when it was difficult. That's more than most people manage. And it will get easier. Much faster than you think."
Jay nodded, too winded to respond. They sat in silence while his breathing gradually slowed, watching the river. The sky had turned deep blue overhead, the first stars beginning to appear.
"You should stretch when you get home, especially your calves and hamstrings. Take a warm shower, not hot. Drink plenty of water before bed. Tomorrow you'll be sore, but it won't be as bad if you follow those steps."
"You're turning into my second gym trainer," Jay said, finally able to speak normally.
Ian laughed. "Rus will have to step up his game to keep up with me."
"I'm not telling him you said that. He'll take it as a challenge."
"We could do this again, if you want. Make it a weekly thing."
"Every week?"
"If you're willing. Regular cardio is important."
"I'd like that."
Another tradition, another thread weaving their lives together. Another carved-out space where they existed together outside of work obligations. Jay felt his heart expand in his chest, warm and almost painful. 
They got up and started walking back, their pace leisurely now. The route took them through serene streets, past closed shops and lit windows, until they reached the crossroads where their paths diverged.
"Goodnight, Jay. You did well tonight."
"Goodnight, Ian. Thanks for running with me."
Ian headed toward his building, his form illuminated by streetlights and then swallowed by shadow. Jay stood there for a moment, watching him go, feeling his heart contract. Then he turned and walked home, his legs already starting to stiffen.
Wednesday was calm at work. Summer's hold on the office had deepened—the vacation season in full effect, the workload distributed evenly enough that overtime remained unnecessary. Even with several people still away, Ray and Liv handled their responsibilities well.
Jay observed the office dynamics with fondness. Rin had developed an obvious admiration for Ray that manifested in persistent but good-natured attempts at friendship. Unlike Gal's attention-seeking behaviour, Rin's efforts were unobtrusive, almost charmingly awkward.
"Ray, did you want to grab lunch?"
Ray didn't even look up from his screen. "No."
Rin retreated without visible disappointment. "Okay, cool. Maybe another time."
Luc appeared beside Jay's desk moments later, theatrical sympathy written across his features. "Our boy Rin strikes out again. Should we start a support group?"
"He doesn't seem particularly bothered," Jay observed.
"That's what makes it so entertaining. He's already accepted defeat but keeps trying anyway."
Jay could have sworn he saw Ray's mouth twitch, almost like he was fighting back a smile. Maybe Ray was less immune to the attention than he pretended.
Either way, the dynamic was harmless. Pleasant, even.
Jay left at five that day and spent forty minutes doing exercises in his apartment. His legs were still sore from Tuesday's run, but not as bad as he'd feared. Ian's advice had worked.
On Thursday after work, Jay headed to the pool, swimming laps in the cool water until his shoulders burned and his thoughts quieted. He'd neglected swimming for too long. Getting it back felt like reclaiming something important.
By Friday, the soreness had faded to almost nothing. Jay felt stronger, more comfortable in his body. He wrapped up his tasks by four, but when five o'clock came, he didn't leave. He told himself he was just finishing a few small things, but in truth he was hoping Ian would suggest dinner again.
He wasn't disappointed. At six, Ian emerged from his office and stopped by Jay's desk.
"Are you planning to stay late?" Ian asked.
"Not particularly. Just tidying up."
"Dinner?"
Jay couldn't suppress a smile. "Yes."
They drove to the same restaurant with the outdoor patio, the awnings filtering the evening light. Jay had been thinking about it since last Friday, and now that it was happening he was glowing with happiness.
They talked about work and urban planning. When they left, the evening air was still warm. They walked to Ian's car, and Ian drove Jay home, and Jay thanked him, and they said goodnight with that same moment of hesitation before parting.
Jay went inside feeling full. The warmth of those few hours would sustain him through the weekend, until Monday came and he could see Ian again.
Chapter 42: Invitations
Scene 1
Excessive is the minimum
Jay took a taxi to the gym on Saturday morning. The metro rides had grown tedious—the waiting, the crowds, the transfers. A taxi cost more, but the expense barely registered anymore. His salary increases had changed that calculation without him quite noticing. He could afford convenience now. He could afford not to exhaust himself before he even arrived.
The ride took twenty minutes instead of fifty, and he arrived ready to work instead of already drained. Rus noticed immediately.
"You look chipper," he said.
"I took a taxi."
"Living fancy now."
"Living efficiently."
They worked through the session with Jay's muscles still protesting from Tuesday's run. Rus pushed him through exercises that targeted different areas, and by the end, Jay felt thoroughly worked.
The taxi ride home was equally effortless. Jay showered, made lunch, and sat on his couch with his phone. He'd been putting off this call for some time.
His mother answered on the third ring. "Jay! I was just thinking about calling you."
"Hi, Mom. How are you?"
"Busy. Ari broke his backpack again, and Ema is convinced she needs a new phone. How are things in the city?"
"Good. Work's busy but manageable."
They talked for a few minutes about surface things. Then Jay took a breath and broached the real reason for his call.
"I wanted to talk about Tim's birthday," he said.
"Oh, yes. It's coming up fast, isn't it? He'll be eighteen. I can't believe it."
"What's he asking for?"
His mother sighed. "A car. He's been talking about it for months. Can you imagine?"
"Actually, that's what I wanted to discuss. What were you planning to spend?"
"I was thinking around five thousand. Enough for something reliable, even if it's older. His father and I have been saving."
"What if we doubled that? I'll match whatever you put in. We could get him something nicer than the shabbiest wreck on the lot."
"Jay, you don't have to do that."
"I want to do this. Tim's turning eighteen. He should have a proper present."
"But five thousand—"
"Is manageable for me. I can afford this. Let me do something nice for my brother. Please."
"Are you sure?"
"I'm sure."
"Then... yes. Thank you. Tim will be over the moon. You've really done well for yourself, haven't you?"
"I've been fortunate."
"You've worked hard. There's a difference."
They talked for a while longer about logistics, car options, when to surprise Tim. By the time Jay hung up, his mood had lifted. It felt good to contribute, to be someone his family could rely on instead of the other way around.
Jay checked his bottles, made notes in his recipe journal, and spent the rest of the afternoon feeling good about life.
Monday brought Max and Zoe back to the office, both tan and spirited. Max regaled anyone who would listen with stories about beaches and ancient ruins, while Zoe showed photos of mountain trails.
Amy and Luc had already left for their own trips, the office still half-staffed but functional. The workload had eased enough that the absences didn't create stress. But Rin seemed lost.
He appeared at Jay's desk more frequently now that Luc was gone. He was competent enough—his work was solid—but he hadn't fully integrated into the office dynamics yet. Ray still responded to him with monosyllables or silence, and Rin seemed to orbit uncertainly between desks.
Jay caught him by the break room Tuseday morning. 
"You all right?" Jay asked.
Rin looked up, startled. "Yeah. Just weird without Luc around."
"He'll be back soon."
"I know. It's stupid. I'm not a kid."
"It's not stupid. Luc is your friend. It makes sense you'd miss having him here."
"Thanks."
"If you need anything, just ask. I'm around."
"Yeah. Okay."
"You're doing well. The adjustment period is difficult, but you're handling it better than most."
Rin's expression relaxed slightly. "Thank you. I was worried I was falling behind."
"You're not. Keep going."
Tuesday evening's run came with cooler temperatures. Jay met Ian outside the building, already warmed up and ready. They started at a light pace. The route was the same, and Jay's body protested just as much as before. His lungs burned, his legs ached, but he kept going.
"I've been thinking about the weekend outing. The one I promised," Ian said after ten minutes.
Jay glanced over, trying not to sound too winded. "What did you decide?"
"There's a classical concert on Saturday evening. Chamber music, mostly. I thought we could make a day of it—lunch, then the concert and dinner. If that interests you."
Jay's first reaction was nerves. Classical music wasn't something he knew anything about, and the thought of sitting in an elegant hall surrounded by people who did made his stomach tighten. But then he thought about spending the day with Ian, and the nerves didn't matter as much.
"That sounds good," Jay said.
"You don't have to agree if it doesn't interest you."
"I want to. I've never been to a concert like that. It'll be new."
"Good. I'll handle the tickets."
A weekend with Ian. A whole Saturday spent together, not just dinner but an entire experience. The intimidation factor was high, but the appeal was higher.
"What should I wear?" Jay asked eventually.
"A suit is standard, but smart casual works as well. Whatever you're comfortable in."
"This is a fancy concert hall, isn't it?"
"It's respectable."
"That's not reassuring."
Ian's mouth quirked. "You'll be fine. I promise I won't let you embarrass yourself."
"That's even less reassuring."
They finished the run and sat on the bench. The river moved slowly past, dark and smooth. Jay caught his breath while Ian looked barely winded.
"You're improving. Last week you were struggling at this point."
"Last week I wanted to die. This week I only want to sleep for twelve hours."
They walked back toward their buildings. When they reached the crossroads and separated, Jay watched Ian's departing form with that same contraction in his chest.  A concert this weekend. A full weekend with Ian. He could manage a concert.
Wednesday afternoon, Jay's phone buzzed with a text from Leo: "Emergency meeting. My place. 6pm. Don't be late."
Jay stared at the message, already resigned to whatever scheme Leo had cooked up now. He texted back: "What's the address?"
The response included a location in one of the city's most expensive districts, because of course it did.
Jay left the office at five-thirty, took a taxi across town, and arrived at a sleek high-rise that screamed wealth. The doorman directed him to the penthouse, which occupied the entire top floor.
Leo opened the door. "Come in, come in."
The penthouse was exactly what Jay had expected—spacious, filled with extravagant furniture and art. He followed Leo, trying not to gawk.
"I've been working on the invitations," Leo announced, leading Jay to a dining table covered in samples. "Take a look."
Jay picked up one of the cards. The paper was thick, the lettering embossed in gold. Formal script announced Ian's fortieth birthday celebration, followed by details about date, time, and venue—a ballroom at one of the city's most exclusive hotels.
"Leo, this is—"
"Perfect? I know."
"I was going to say excessive."
"It's Ian's fortieth. Excessive is the minimum. Look at the detail work on the border. And the paper quality—feel that."
Jay felt it. It was indeed exceptional paper. That was exactly the problem.
"This is going to be an extremely formal event, isn't it?"
"Refined. Sophisticated. Worthy of Ian."
"How many people are we talking about?"
"About a hundred, maybe a few more."
"A hundred people?"
"It's not that many for a proper gala. And Ian knows a lot of people, even if he doesn't socialize much anymore."
"Who are you inviting?"
"Everyone important. The office, obviously. But also friends from Ian's past. People who stood by him during the difficult years. Ian isolated himself after the scandal, but there were people who didn't abandon him. They should be there."
"That's actually thoughtful."
"I'm occasionally capable of thoughtfulness. There might be some past flames. People Ian dated casually over the years. Nothing serious, but they were part of his life. They're still on good terms, mostly."
"Oh."
"Very refined people. Very accomplished. Ian has excellent taste. You'll fit right in, don't worry."
"I wasn't worried."
"You look worried."
"I'm concerned about the formality level."
"Speaking of which—the suit. How was the final fitting?"
"I haven't had it yet. They said three weeks."
"You need to look your absolute best. This is going to be a gathering of Ian's peers. Everyone will be dressed impeccably. You can't show up looking ordinary."
"I am ordinary."
"You work for Turner & Associates. You're Ian's right hand. You're not ordinary. Look, this party is important. Ian needs to see that people value him, that he's surrounded by success and elegance and people who care. You're part of that picture. You need to look the part."
Jay felt oddly insecure. "I'll do my best."
"Your best is good. But let me know if you need anything—accessories, shoes, whatever. I can make recommendations."
"I'll manage."
"Good. The party is in four and a half weeks. Everything is falling into place perfectly."
They discussed more details—catering options, music, whether to have speeches. Jay left the penthouse an hour later, his head spinning with details. A hundred people. Past boyfriends. Elegant crowds where Jay would be judged and found wanting.
But it was for Ian. To show Ian he mattered, that people cared about him. That was worth the discomfort.
Jay took a taxi back to his apartment and spent the evening checking his infusion jars with more aggression than necessary. Four weeks to finish the tinctures, to prepare himself mentally, to figure out how to survive an evening surrounded by people from Ian's real world.
He could do this. For Ian, he could do anything.
Friday evening, Ian took Jay to the same restaurant they'd been returning to for weeks. It had become expected now—finishing work at six, driving to the restaurant, sharing a meal.
They ordered and ate talking about the week's events. Max's dramatic retellings of his trip. Rin's questions. The upcoming deadlines for September.
"Have you thought more about vacation time?" Ian asked as they finished their main courses.
"Not really. There's no particular place I want to go."
"You should take time off regardless. Rest is important."
"I won't take vacation unless you do."
"Jay—"
"Ian. I'm not being martyrish. I'm being practical. Taking vacation alone while you're working would just make me anxious. I'd rather wait until we can both take time off."
"That's not fair to you."
"It's my choice."
"A choice you're making because you disapprove of my work ethic."
"A choice I'm making because I prefer working with you to taking forced rest alone. Can we please table this argument? We've had the same conversation before and it didn't go anywhere."
"Alright. Tabled."
As Ian drove Jay home later, he thought he couldn't bear another week without seeing Jay. The weekends were hard enough now. The idea of a full week away from Jay was unbearable.
But that was monumentally selfish. Ian should encourage Jay to take vacation. He should insist on it. Jay deserved rest, deserved time away from the office and the stress and Ian's constant proximity. Ian just couldn't bring himself to let go. He was prioritizing his own desires over Jay's well-being. He was keeping Jay tethered to the office because he couldn't stand the thought of separation. He should be better than this. He should be strong enough to send Jay away for his own good. But he wasn't. He was weak and selfish and desperately grateful that Jay kept refusing to leave.
Scene 2
Complications
Saturday morning at the gym started normally enough. Jay was finishing his warm-up when Rus appeared with an odd expression.
"So. Got something interesting in the mail yesterday."
"What?"
"An invitation. Very fancy. Heavy paper, embossed lettering. Party for your boss. Didn't know I was moving in those circles now." Rus pulled out his phone and showed Jay a photo of the invitation. It was one of Leo's elegant designs.
"Oh god."
"Mic and Van got one too. We're all very confused. We met your boss exactly once, I wouldn't call that friendship. But maybe we misjudged? Is this some high-society thing where you invite everyone you've ever met?"
Jay felt his horror mounting. "No, this is—I don't know what this is. I need to call Leo."
"The one who hired you?"
"Yes. He's organizing the party. I didn't—he wasn't supposed to—" Jay fumbled for his phone and dialed Leo's number. It went straight to voicemail.
"Damn it."
"Jay, it's fine. We're just surprised. Should we RSVP?"
"I don't know. Let me figure out what's happening."
"You look stressed about this."
"Because I am. This isn't—Leo's doing something I didn't agree to."
"Well, let us know. Mic already started looking up what to wear to a gala."
Jay tried calling Leo three more times during his workout. Voicemail every time.
By afternoon, Jay had forced himself to set aside his anxiety about the invitations. He had a concert to attend. An evening with Ian. He couldn't let Leo's schemes ruin it.
He dressed in his gray tailored three-piece suit, the onyx cufflinks Ian had given him for his birthday. He checked himself in the mirror three times, adjusting the waistcoat, smoothing his hair. He could almost pass for someone who belonged in Ian’s world, but the stiffness in his posture exposed him—always out of place, always the impostor.
Ian arrived at four. He was wearing a dark navy suit, perfectly cut, and he looked effortlessly elegant, something Jay suspected he’d never achieve himself. They headed down to Ian's car, and Jay tried to keep his thoughts off Leo and the invitations.
"You look very sharp," Ian said.
"Thank you. So do you."
They drove to a restaurant in the city centre, a place with no sign outside and no prices printed on the menu. Jay had been to similar places with Ian before, but he still felt the discomfort of it—the knowledge that he was performing a version of himself that didn't quite fit.
The morning's revelation about the invitations hadn't helped. He kept wondering what else Leo had done without consulting him.
"You're quiet," Ian observed after they'd ordered.
"Just taking it in," Jay said, which wasn't entirely a lie.
"If you'd rather go somewhere else—"
"No, this is fine. It's nice."
"You look like you're preparing for battle." 
"Do I?"
"A little. Relax. It's just lunch."
"Fancy lunch."
"Still just lunch."
Jay tried to loosen the tension in his shoulders. Ian was trying to put him at ease, and the least Jay could do was meet him halfway.
After lunch, they drove to the concert hall. Ian found parking nearby, and they walked the last few blocks.
"We're early. I wanted to show you the area. There's a sculpture garden just past the hall that's worth seeing."
They walked through streets lined with elegant old buildings, art galleries, expensive boutiques. The sculpture garden was small but beautiful, filled with modern pieces in stone and metal. Jay followed Ian through it, trying to appreciate what he was seeing, but he felt conspicuously out of place.
The concert hall itself was magnificent. Soaring ceilings, marble floors, chandeliers that cast warm light over everything. People milled about in the lobby, all of them looking comfortable. Jay's suit was good, but he still felt provincial, like someone who'd wandered into the wrong room. Ian must have noticed. He touched Jay's elbow lightly, guiding him toward a quieter corner.
"The acoustics are supposed to be exceptional. The hall was renovated five years ago. They reinforced the structure while preserving the original aesthetic."
"It's beautiful."
"You seem uncomfortable."
"I'm just not used to places like this."
"It's just a building. Just people. You belong here as much as anyone."
Jay wanted to believe that. He tried to relax into Ian's reassurance, but Ian's eyes had that look like he was somewhere else entirely. They found their seats, and the concert began.
The music was lovely, intricate and well performed, and Jay tried to focus on it, but he kept noticing Ian's stillness, the way his attention seemed to drift even when his eyes were on the stage. Jay didn't know what was wrong, but he felt a change.
Dinner afterwards was at another elegant restaurant, this one smaller, more intimate. Ian had reserved a table, and they sat across from each other in the low light. Jay ordered something simple, still feeling full from lunch. Ian did the same, but he barely touched his food.
Jay tried to lift the mood, telling Ian a story about Rin accidentally emailing the entire company instead of just Luc, then another about Max's vacation photos featuring an alarming number of seagulls. He kept his tone light, trying to draw Ian out without being obvious about it. Ian smiled, but he'd grown even quieter, as if he was half in another place.
Jay wondered if he'd been too awkward at lunch, too visibly uncomfortable at the concert. Maybe he'd spoiled the evening without realizing it.
So he tried harder. Questions about the music, about the composers, about anything that might draw Ian back out of wherever he'd retreated to. Ian responded, but it sounded like he didn't want to burden Jay with whatever he was thinking.
They both forced tenderness through the tension, pretending nothing was wrong.
When Ian dropped Jay off, they said goodnight like always. Whatever happened, it felt too tangled to address directly.
Sunday was gray, both outside and in Jay's head.
Jay tried to distract himself with cleaning, with reading, with anything that would stop him from replaying the previous evening and trying to identify the problem. He couldn't pinpoint the moment things had turned sour, but they had. Ian had been fine at lunch, a little distant at the concert, and progressively quieter through dinner. Had he said something wrong? Reminded Ian too starkly of the distance between their worlds? He felt like he failed some test he hadn't known he was taking.
In his own apartment, Ian sat on the couch and brooded.
Sam Connelly had loved classical music. Ian had been so excited to share that part of his life, to bring Sam to concerts, to discuss compositions and interpretations. Sam had seemed equally enthusiastic, engaging fully.
All of it a lie. All of it part of the performance Sam had maintained to gain Ian's trust.
And yesterday, sitting in that concert hall with Jay, the memories had intruded. Sam's voice commenting on the orchestra. Sam's hand on Ian's arm during a particularly moving passage. The complete fabrication of shared interest and mutual understanding.
Ian had tried to push it away, to stay present with Jay, but the ghost had won.
Jay had noticed and tried so hard to fix it, and Ian had felt too guilty to let him, too aware that his own past was poisoning something that should be simple and good.
He hadn't meant to let it intrude. Jay deserved better than to be overshadowed by Ian's past, but Ian hadn't been able to shake it. And now Jay probably thought Ian had regretted the entire outing.
Monday morning began with a phone call from Ema that shattered whatever fragile calm Jay had managed to build.
"Jay! I got an invitation!"
"What?"
"To the party! Ian's birthday party! Leo sent me one! I've been messaging him on social media and I told him I wanted to come and he said yes!"
Jay's blood went cold. "Ema, you can't—"
"I know it's fancy, but I'll be so good, I promise. I'll dress up and I won't embarrass you. Please, Jay, please let me come. It's a real gala. I've never been to anything like that."
"Ema, no. You're sixteen. You can't go to something like this."
"But Leo said—"
"I don't care what Leo said. You're not going."
 "Jay, please. I really want to."
"I said no. I'll talk to Mom."
"Mom already said I can't, but if you say it's okay—"
"It's not okay. I'm sorry, but it's not happening."
There was a long silence, and then Ema started crying.
"I have to go. I'll call you later." Jay hung up and immediately dialed his mother.
"I know," she said before he could speak. "She showed me the invitation. I already told her no."
"Good. Thank you."
"She's very upset."
"I know. But she's a child. She doesn't belong at something like this."
"I agree. I'll talk to her again."
Jay hung up and tried Leo's number. Still voicemail.
Ten minutes later, Ema's first text arrived: "Please, Jay. I'll do anything. I won't ask for anything else ever again." By the time he arrived at the office, Jay was exhausted and stressed. The texts from Ema hadn't stopped.
Ian appeared at his desk mid-morning. "Do you have a moment?"
"Of course."
They went to Ian's office. Ian closed the door and turned to face him.
"Is something wrong?"
"No. Why?"
"You seem distracted."
"I'm fine. Just a family thing. Nothing serious."
Ian looked like he wanted to press, but he didn't. "If you need anything—"
"I know. Thank you."
Jay returned to his desk and tried to appear normal, but the texts kept coming and Leo remained unreachable. He hated worrying Ian, especially when Ian was already dealing with whatever had been bothering him on Saturday, but he couldn't explain the Ema situation without admitting Leo's party planning had gone completely off the rails. And he couldn't do that without potentially stressing Ian about his own birthday.
And Ian kept glancing at him from his office. He was certain now. Saturday had been his fault. He'd spoiled the evening and now Jay was hurt. 
By the end of the day, Ema had sent six more texts, each one sadder and more pleading than the last.
Tuesday's jog was tense. Jay couldn't shake the stress, and it showed in the way he ran—too fast at first, then flagging, his breathing uneven.
Halfway through, Ian said, "I wanted to apologize for Saturday."
"What?"
"I wasn't good company. I'm sorry if I made the evening uncomfortable."
"You didn't. I thought I did. I was worried I'd been too awkward."
"You weren't. I let something distract me and I made you uncomfortable. I'm sorry."
"It's okay. Really. I wasn't upset about that."
"Then what were you upset about?"
Ian looked distressed, and Jay felt guilty. He didn’t want to trouble him with Leo’s messes, yet keeping it secret was clearly causing more damage than telling him outright.
"Leo sent invitations to people I didn't expect. Including my sister. Who now desperately wants to attend a formal gala with rich people and alcohol, and my mother and I both said no, and she's been texting me nonstop about how unfair I'm being."
"Leo invited your sister?"
"And my gym trainer. And his friends. People who barely know you. I've been trying to call him all weekend but his phone's off."
"I'll talk to him."
"No. Don't. This party is supposed to be good for you, not a source of stress. I'll deal with Leo myself. As soon as I can actually reach him."
"Jay, this is my party. I should—"
"You should enjoy it. That's all. Let me handle the rest."
Ian looked unconvinced but didn't argue further.
Scene 3
The most proper man
Leo remained unreachable, and Ema's texts kept coming—sad, disappointed, pleading. She promised to behave, to dress perfectly, to not embarrass him. She just wanted to go to a real gala. Jay's stress mounted. Every text felt like a small knife, guilt and frustration twisting together.
Ian noticed. He didn't push, but his concern was visible, and that made Jay feel worse.
By Friday, Jay was worn down. Ian took him to dinner again, but Jay was quiet, picking at his food.
"You're still upset," Ian said halfway through the meal.
"Leo's still unreachable. Ema's still texting. My mother's still angry. I don't know how to fix this."
"Maybe it's not such a bad idea."
"What?"
"Your sister attending. If she's properly supervised."
"You don't understand. My mother will never allow it."
"Why not?"
"She just won't. She doesn't want Ema around wealthy people."
"It wouldn't be like that. You'd be there. I'd be there. We'd watch over her. It's a birthday party, nothing nefarious."
"You don't know my mother."
"No, but I know you. And I know you wouldn't let anything bad happen to your sister."
Jay wanted to believe it could be that simple. But he knew his mother's reasons for keeping distance from his world. The fear that her children might be exposed to people who might hurt them.
"I'm still not convinced," Jay said.
"Think about it. That's all I'm asking."
For the rest of the evening, Jay's mind was tangled with Ema and Leo and the party that was supposed to be simple but had become increasingly complicated. When Ian dropped him off at their building, Jay felt no closer to a solution.
"I'm losing my mind," Jay announced at the gym on Saturday.
"What happened now?" Rus asked.
"Leo invited Ema, my sixteen-year-old sister. And she's furious I won't let her come. She won't stop texting me. My mother is losing her mind. Leo disappeared off the face of the earth. And apparently you got invited too, which—why? You met Ian once."
"Twice, technically. Once when we helped you move, once at your birthday party. And we RSVP'd to the party. Hope that's alright."
"You did?"
"Yeah. Mic is thrilled about the whole formal dress-up thing. He's already bought a new suit. Van's not really into it but Mic convinced him to come anyway. If you'd rather we didn't—"
Jay groaned and put his head in his hands. "I don't mind you being there. It's fine. Great, even. But my sister—she thinks it's going to be glamorous and exciting. My mother thinks it's going to be dangerous and inappropriate."
"If you bring her, I'll watch her. Personally. Like a hawk. Make sure nobody bothers her, make sure she stays out of trouble. But honestly, if you have such a high opinion of Ian—and you clearly do—then the party shouldn't really pose any threats to young girls, right? Ian would never allow anything inappropriate to happen."
"That's... actually a good point."
"I know. I have them occasionally."
"Ian would be horrified if anyone behaved inappropriately around Ema. He'd shut it down immediately."
"Exactly. So maybe your mom's fears aren't as relevant here as she thinks."
Rus was right. Nothing untoward would happen under Ian's watch, but that didn't make convincing his mother any easier.
Back at home that afternoon, Jay called his mother. The conversation went on for over an hour.
"Mom, listen. I know you're worried—"
"Worried? Jay, she has no business at an event like that."
"I'll be there. Ian will be there. My friend Rus already promised to watch her specifically."
"You don't understand what these people are like."
"I work with these people every day."
"That's different. You're an adult. You can handle yourself. Ema is a child who thinks everything is glamorous and exciting. She doesn't see danger until it's too late."
"She's going to resent us both if we say no."
"Let her resent me. I'm her mother. I'm supposed to protect her, not give her what she wants."
"What if it's just a party and she has a nice time and comes home safe?"
"And what if it isn't? What if someone pays too much attention to her? What if she gets ideas about a life she can't have?"
Jay didn't know how to answer that. The fear in his mother's voice was too deep, too rooted in experiences he didn't fully understand.
"Can we just think about it? We don't have to decide right now."
"There's nothing to think about."
"Mom—"
"I have to go. We'll talk later."
She hung up before he could respond. Jay stared at his phone, exhausted by the argument he couldn't win and didn't entirely want to.
The final fitting was scheduled for that same afternoon. Jay arrived at the tailor's shop feeling wrung out from the phone call. The tailor greeted him with and led him to the fitting room. Three suits hung waiting—one black, severe and formal, the other two in lighter shades of charcoal and navy, classic and elegant.
"Try the black one first," the tailor instructed.
Jay changed and examined himself in the mirrors. The suit fit perfectly. Every line, every angle, every proportion exactly right.  The other two suits were equally perfect. Almost no adjustments needed. The tailor made notes, confirmed delivery dates, and sent Jay home with the knowledge that his collection of expensive, perfectly tailored suits was now comprehensive enough for any conceivable occasion.
The final week of August drifted by. Tia Larson's start date was confirmed for the first week of September, and Jay once again prepared onboarding materials.
The Tuesday jogs continued. Jay's form showed barely any improvement—he still struggled through the last third, still arrived at the bench breathing hard, but at least it was becoming less awkward now.
Friday dinner also happened naturally. Jay did his best not to mope about the party situation, though he couldn't help pouting dramatically.
"Leo is ruining my life."
"That seems excessive."
"He's been unreachable for two weeks. Two weeks. Who does that?"
"Leo, apparently. Though in fairness, Leo's always been erratic about communication."
"He invited a child to a formal gala without asking permission. He invited people I barely know. He disappeared for two weeks. I'm not being excessive."
"You really are upset with him."
"I'm furious with him."
"It's a little endearing."
"Don't encourage him by finding this amusing."
"For what it's worth, I think your sister would be safe at the party. But I understand your mother's concerns."
"Do you?"
"Protective instincts don't always align with logic. Sometimes fear is just fear, regardless of whether it's justified."
"She has reasons."
"I'm sure she does."
They didn't discuss it further. The evening continued pleasantly, and when Ian drove Jay home, the week didn't seem that gloomy anymore.
Sunday morning, Leo finally answered his phone.
"Jay! How are you?"
"How am I? How am I? Leo, I've been trying to reach you for two weeks!"
"I was traveling. My phone was off."
"You invited my sister to the party!"
"She seemed enthusiastic about it."
"She's sixteen!"
"So? She'll be supervised. What's the problem?"
Jay wanted to reach through the phone and strangle him. "The problem is you didn't ask me first. The problem is my mother is furious. The problem is you're making decisions about my family without consulting me."
"You're being melodramatic."
"I'm being—" Jay stopped, forced himself to breathe. "Leo, this isn't okay."
"Jay, nothing bad is going to happen. Ian is the most proper man in the district. Your sister will be at a party attended by respectable people, with you present, with Ian present, probably with half the office present. What exactly do you think is going to happen?"
Jay couldn't actually answer that. When Leo laid it out that way, his mother's fears did sound abstract.
"She might not even be allowed to come," Jay said finally.
"Then she won't. Problem solved. Look, I'm sorry I didn't ask first. But I thought it would be fine. And I was unavailable because I was abroad hunting for Ian's birthday gift. Which, by the way, is spectacular."
"What kind of gift?"
"Can't tell you. It's a surprise. But I had to go to three different countries to track it down."
"Three countries?"
"Worth every kilometre. Ian's going to love it."
After they hung up, Jay sat on his couch and stared at the wall. Three countries. Leo had traveled to three different countries to find Ian's birthday gift. Jay's gift suddenly felt desperately inadequate.
He stood up and went to his kitchen cupboards, pulling out jars and bottles and packets of herbs. The tinctures he'd made were looking good, but not special enough. Not when competing with whatever Leo had hunted down across three countries. 
He'd try harder. He opened his laptop and started ordering new ingredients. Alpine herbs, unusual spices, along with a dozen more jars. Things he could infuse quickly, experiment with, create variations. Different ratios, different bases, blind experimentation with the hope that something would turn out exceptional.
His cupboards were already overflowing, jars lined every available surface. Half of them eventually migrated to the basement storage when there was simply no room left in his apartment. But it still felt like it wasn't enough. 
He pulled up his laptop and resumed searching. Gifts for people who appreciate classical music. Concert tickets. Music boxes. First edition scores.
Everything was either too generic or required more time than Jay had left. He was starting to panic.
Scene 4
Tia Larson
September brought cooler mornings and the first hints of gold in the trees. Amy and Luc returned on Monday, both looking refreshed.
Kim and Ela departed together, no longer pretending their joint leave was coincidental. They'd chosen a mountain getaway in the late summer warmth, Kim showing photos of the charming cabin they'd rented while Ela made comments about finally getting proper rest.
The office reshuffled to accommodate the changes. And into this transition walked Rin's salvation.
"Thank god you're back. I've been surrounded by people who either ignore me or terrify me for two weeks," Rin said, appearing at Luc's desk within seconds.
Luc set down his bag with theatrical gravity. "Fear not, young apprentice. Your mentor has returned from his journey across distant lands. Did you miss me?"
"Yes." The answer was completely earnest.
"Well then, gather round young one, and let me tell you tales of my adventures. There were bears. Possibly. I saw something large and brown. Could have been a dog."
Jay watched from his desk as Rin pulled up a chair and Luc launched into an increasingly exaggerated account of his camping trip. Within minutes, Rin was laughing.
Jay walked over. "Welcome back."
"Jay! You survived without me. I'm almost offended by how well the office functioned in my absence."
"We barely managed. There was crying. Possibly mine."
"As there should be. How was August? Anything exciting happen?"
"Define exciting."
"Anything that would make a good story."
"Then no. Completely boring. We just worked."
"Lies. You're a terrible liar." Luc turned to Rin. "Was he lying?"
"Absolutely," Rin said immediately.
"Traitor," Jay said dramatically.
They bantered for a few more minutes before Jay returned to his desk. The office felt more balanced with Luc back—his voice filling spaces that had seemed too quiet.
But Monday also brought another addition.
Tia Larson arrived at nine o'clock. Jay and Ian met her in the lobby. She was tall, straight-backed, with short dark hair and a handshake that could crush stone. Her voice was crisp, her stride fast, and everything about her screamed military background.
They'd coordinated the introduction the same way they had for every recent hire—brief but welcoming.
"Tia Larson. Pleased to be here."
"Jay Hall. This is Ian Hagen, CFO."
"Sir. Thank you for the opportunity."
"Welcome to Turner & Associates. Jay will handle your initial orientation. HR will take over for the standard lectures."
They gave her a short tour—the floor layout, the break room, the various departments. Jay tried to balance friendliness with caution. She seemed direct, nothing like Gal. But Jay had learned that first impressions could be deceiving. He'd keep his guard up.
After the brief introduction, he handed her off to HR. Two days of lectures about company policy, benefits, procedures, the standard onboarding process that every new hire endured.
The air was cooler during the Tuesday's jog. Jay noticed it right away—autumn was coming, summer finally loosening its grip.
"How's Tia doing?" Ian asked.
"Hard to say. She's only been here two days, and most of that was HR. I'll know more after this week. I think she will be fine, though. She seems focused. Not the type to cause problems."
They ran in silence for a while, and then Jay said, "It's strange how quickly the seasons change. Feels like summer just started."
"It does."
"Another few weeks and it'll be too cold for comfortable evening runs."
"We'll adjust the schedule. Earlier in the day, perhaps."
"Or move indoors."
"Indoor tracks are depressing."
"Says the man who spends seven days a week in a gym."
"That's different. That's disciplined training. Indoor track running is soul-crushing monotony."
"Fair."
"You must be getting more comfortable if you have this much energy to talk." 
Jay realized he was right. The run still required effort, but he wasn't gasping for air between words anymore. "I guess I'm getting better at this."
They finished the route without further conversation, but Jay felt pleased. He was still tired, still feeling the burn in his muscles, but it was already easier.
Tia adapted quickly through her first week. She was direct, asked questions when she needed clarification, and didn't seem prone to conflict. She completed the HR orientations and transitioned into actual work without drama.
Jay assigned her standard novice tasks—data verification, report formatting, simple analysis reviews. She handled everything well, working diligently through assignments. Her previous finance experience was evident in how quickly she grasped the nuances.
Rin appointed himself unofficial tour guide, showing her the office amenities.
"The coffee machine has twelve settings. It makes everything. Espresso, cappuccino, lattes. There's a setting for foam density. It's incredible."
"Noted," Tia said, amused.
"And the snacks. The snacks are important. The dark chocolate almonds are the best, but the dried mango is also really good. The sea salt crackers are phenomenal. The fruit smoothies are so-so, but Jay seems to love them."
"Essential information."
"I know. I take my responsibilities as tour guide very seriously."
Tia joined the lunch group Wednesday afternoon. Max had led an outing to a sandwich shop he claimed made the best pastrami in the city. The group that assembled included Jay, Tia, Max, Luc, Amy, Rin, Liv and Zoe.
They walked through cooling September air to a hole-in-the-wall shop with questionable decor and amazing smells. Tia integrated into the group without apparent intimidation, taking her place at the crowded table and participating in conversations.
"How are you finding the office so far?" Amy asked.
"Elegenat. Better coffee than my last position. The team seems solid. Everyone I've met has been helpful. Though I notice there's one person who hasn't shown his face—Ray, was it?"
"Ray is... particular," Luc said diplomatically.
"He's antisocial," Max corrected. "Brilliant analyst, terrible human interaction skills. Don't take it personally."
"I don't take much personally."
They ate and talked through lunch. Tia answered questions about her background—military logistics, private sector finance. She asked questions in return about office culture, project dynamics.
Jay watched Tia throughout the meal. She was confident but not domineering, direct but not aggressive. Nothing like Gal. But Jay's wariness remained. First impressions could deceive. He'd stay watchful.
Friday afternoon, Max organized welcome drinks for Tia at their favourite bar. The invitation was casual—come if you want, no pressure, just a few hours of informal socializing.
Jay was comically stiff about the whole thing. He kept remembering Gal at similar gatherings, how normal everything had seemed right up until it wasn't. Ian attended reluctantly. He almost never came to these events, but felt obligated given Tia's position. 
They arrived at six to find Max, Luc, Amy, Zoe, Rin, and Tia already assembled around a large table. Liv appeared shortly after, elegant and smiling. Ray, predictably, never showed.
Ian ordered a single glass of wine. Jay got a beer. They sat at opposite ends of the table, surrounded by the cheerful noise.
Tia, it turned out, could drink like a sailor.
"Another round," she announced after finishing her second beer in twenty minutes.
"Already?" Luc looked impressed.
She proceeded to match Max drink for drink, then surpass him. Luc tried to keep pace and failed spectacularly. Within an hour, both men were visibly drunk while Tia looked unbothered.
"How are you still coherent?" Max asked.
"Superior constitution. Also, I'm pacing myself. You two are not."
Jay stayed on his first beer. Ian left after forty-five minutes. Jay noticed Ian checking the time repeatedly. He assumed Ian was simply unhappy about having to attend, counting down until he could make an exit.
What Jay didn't realize was that Ian was annoyed this gathering was cutting into their Friday dinner. Ian had come to depend on those evenings. This disruption felt disproportionately frustrating, though he tried to act unperturbed.
Liv left shortly after Ian, making graceful excuses and promising to see everyone Monday. The group grew smaller, louder, more relaxed.
By eight o'clock, Luc was actively drunk and Rin had appointed himself caretaker. Max was wobbling and Amy had taken charge of his coordination. Tia remained standing, amused by the situation.
"We should get them home," Jay said to Rin.
"Yeah. Probably."
Amy appeared at Jay's elbow, looking resigned. "I'll help with Max. You two take Luc?"
"Sure."
"I'll help with Max," Tia offered.
"All right then."
They split into groups. Jay and Rin each took one of Luc's arms, leading him to the street where they managed to get a taxi. Luc rambled the entire way about mountains and the meaning of life.
"You're a good friend, Jay. Really good. Don't let anyone tell you different."
"Thanks, Luc."
"And you, Rin. You're gonna be great. Just gotta believe in yourself."
"I'll remember that," Rin said seriously.
They delivered Luc to his apartment, made sure he got inside safely, and headed back out.
"That was eventful," Rin said.
"That's one word for it."
"Tia seems nice though. Different from—" Rin stopped.
"Different from Gal. You can say it."
"Yeah. Very different."
Jay got home at nine-thirty, exhausted and faintly amused. This was certainly an unusual social integration. Tia had held her own and made an impression.
Inside his apartment, Jay checked his bottles. The new experimental batches were progressing—alpine herbs turning the vodka a pale green, creating complex aromas. His gift was expanding beyond what he'd originally planned, but Leo's words still haunted him. Something expensive, something that required international travel.
Jay sealed the cabinet and sat on his couch.
He thought about Friday dinners. He wondered if they would continue, or if tonight had broken the streak. He thought about how much more time they spent together now compared to even a few months ago.
August had been intense, but it had also been full of Ian.
Jay wasn't sure if this was temporary—a strange month of circumstances that pushed them together—or if this was his new reality. If these patterns would continue or gradually fade back to how it was before.
He was too afraid to think about it more deeply. Too afraid that whatever this thing between him and Ian was, it was too fragile to survive scrutiny. That examining it too closely would make it collapse.
Two more weeks until Ian's birthday party.
Each passing day made him feel more scared than excited. The gift he'd been making felt inadequate. The party felt too large, too formal. His sister might or might not be allowed to attend, creating potential drama. Leo had invited half the city, apparently. And through it all, Jay would have to smile and pretend he was just Ian's assistant, just a colleague, just someone who happened to care about whether the evening went well.
Scene 5
Daring outfit
The weekend brought the party back into sharp focus. Two weeks away. Fourteen days.
Jay stood in his kitchen surrounded by jars of tinctures, tasting each one. This one was too bitter. That one lacked depth. Another was interesting but not special. Nothing felt good enough.
He revisited his notes, reading through combinations and steeping times, trying to identify where he'd gone wrong. The alpine herbs should have added complexity. But the results were just—fine. Not amazing.
Jay tried to be objective. These were nice liquors, but they were still homemade. Still amateur compared to what someone could buy from a proper distillery. Childish. That's what they felt like. A child's art project presented to an adult who deserved so much better.
He'd placed an order for crystal bottles—hand-carved, art deco style, breathtakingly expensive—hoping that presentation might compensate for the contents. He'd also ordered a wooden display box, something elegant to hold the collection. At least it would look presentable.
He opened his laptop and searched desperately for alternatives. The results were the same as always—expensive watches, first edition books, art pieces. Things Ian either already owned or wouldn't want. Things Jay couldn't afford even with his increased salary.
He closed the laptop and stared at the jars again. Two more weeks. Hopefully at least some of these mixtures would turn out good enough.
Sunday afternoon, Ema called again. Jay almost didn't answer—he'd received three texts from her that day already, each more dramatic than the last.
"Please, Jay. Please let me go to the party."
"Ema—"
"It might be my one chance. My one chance in my entire life to go to a real ball, like in books. To have a memory I'll keep forever. Please. I'll do anything. I'll follow every rule. I won't embarrass you. Please."
The desperation in her voice cracked something in him. She wanted magic and glamour and a single evening of feeling special.
"Alright."
"What?"
"You can come. But there are conditions."
"Anything!"
"You stay with me at all times. You don't drink alcohol. You don't go anywhere alone. You're respectful and polite. And if I say it's time to leave, we leave. No arguments."
"Yes! Yes, I promise. Thank you, Jay. Thank you so much!"
"And if anyone makes you uncomfortable, you tell me immediately."
"I will. I swear."
"I'll talk to Mom."
Ema burst into tears, but this time they sounded like relief. "Thank you. Thank you so much."
"Don't thank me yet. Mom still has to agree."
She hung up, and Jay sat staring at his phone, wondering what he'd just agreed to. Convincing his mother was harder. The conversation lasted nearly two hours, tense and circular.
"You don't understand what you're asking," she said.
"I do understand."
"Jay—" 
"I know how dangerous people can be. I know exactly how dangerous. If I had any doubts about the integrity of these people, any doubts at all, I would never consider bringing Ema. But I don't have doubts. These are good people. Nothing inappropriate will happen."
"You can't control everything."
"No, but I can control who she's near and where she goes. She'll be with me the entire time. Or with Rus, who's built like a mountain and extremely protective. She'll be safe, Mom. I promise."
"You really believe that?"
"I do."
"Fine. But if anything goes wrong—"
"It won't."
"If it does, this is on you."
"I know."
After they hung up, Jay received a text from Ema: "MOM SAID YES!!! CAN I BRING LAM???? THE INVITATION SAYS PLUS ONE!!!"
Jay stared at the message. Two sixteen-year-olds. This was going to be a disaster.
He texted back: "Yes. Same rules apply to her."
"THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU I LOVE YOU!!!"
That evening, Jay tried on his suits.
The black one looked severe. The blue was better but still conservative. The gray made him think of that disastrous evening when someone had compared him to a funeral director. None of them felt right. They were all too serious, too staid.
He needed something different. Something stylish and modern and bold. Something that would let him stand among Ian's refined friends without feeling like a provincial pretender. 
Monday afternoon, Jay left work at five—earlier than he'd left on a Monday in months, and walked straight to Hathaway's Menswear.
The clerk greeted him immediately, smiling like they were old friends. "Good afternoon. Lovely to see you again."
"I need something for an event. Something dashing, but less formal."
"I assume you mean Mr. Hagen's birthday celebration?"
"How did you know that?"
"It's the talk of the district. Our shop is directly across from the Northlight Financial Center. I've seen you leave with Mr. Hagen on multiple occasions. And he's not exactly anonymous."
"Right. Of course."
"I'm Eli, by the way. I don't think I properly introduced myself last time."
"Jay Hall."
"A pleasure. So. Mr. Hagen's fortieth birthday gala. What kind of impression are you hoping to make?"
"I want to look stunning. Budget is not a concern."
"Excellent. Let's see what we can do."
For the next two hours, Jay tried on outfit after outfit. Eli pulled pieces Jay would never have chosen himself—jackets with interesting cuts, shirts in unexpected colors, pants that fit differently than anything Jay owned.
Finally, they settled on something daring. A blazer with a subtle floral pattern, elegant but eye-catching. A shirt with the top buttons deliberately left open, no tie. Pants that were, as Eli delicately put it, "very flattering to your proportions."
Jay stared at himself in the mirror. He looked stylish.
"You look spectacular. Trust me on this."
"The blazer isn't too much?"
"It's exactly enough. You'll stand out, but in the right way. You'll be the best-dressed person in that room."
"I doubt that." 
"Then you'll be in the top five. Which is impressive at an event where everyone will be dressed to kill. I know a hairstylist. Very talented. I'll arrange an appointment for you on the day of the party. He'll finish the look perfectly."
"That's—that's very generous."
"You're a good customer, Mr. Hall. And honestly, I'd love to see how this turns out."
The price was exorbitant but bearable. The occasion justified the cost.
He paid, arranged for tailoring adjustments, and exchanged phone numbers with Eli for coordination about the hairstylist.
"How can I repay you for all this help?" Jay asked.
Eli laughed. "An invitation to the party would be ideal. I've heard it's going to be the event of the season, but I'll settle for a bottle of good alcohol if you insist."
Jay hesitated. "I could probably arrange an invitation. If you're serious."
"Are you sure? I'd hate to impose."
"You've been incredibly helpful. And apparently half the city is already invited."
"Then I'd be honored. Thank you."
They shook hands and Jay left, feeling simultaneously relieved and anxious. One problem solved, at least partially.
But the gift still gave him a headache. And now he was wondering if inviting Eli was reckless. He barely knew him. What if he caused some kind of commotion? But he'd been helpful, and Jay appreciated it. And Eli had been nothing but professional and kind during all their interactions.
Tuesday evening, Ian met him at the park for their run. Jay arrived on time, still feeling slightly off-balance from the shopping trip.
They started jogging, and after a few minutes, Ian spoke.
"You left early yesterday."
"Yeah. I had an errand."
"Everything all right?"
"Fine. I just went shopping."
Jay decided to change the subject before Ian could probe further. "I convinced my mother to let Ema attend the party."
"You did?"
"After multiple conversations and a long list of conditions, yes. She'll be bringing her best friend Lam. Both are absolutely thrilled about attending a real ball. I'm completely responsible for their safety and behavior. No pressure."
"That was generous of you. I know you had reservations."
"I still have reservations. But Ema was so excited. And you were right—with proper supervision, it should be fine."
They ran in silence for a while. Then Jay spoke again, keeping his voice casual.
"Actually, speaking of the party—would you mind if I invited one more person? An acquaintance."
"Of course not. Invite whoever you'd like."
"Are you sure? I don't want to—"
"It's fine. The more people celebrating, the better."
"Thank you. I appreciate it."
"Of course."
That evening, Ian sat at his kitchen table with untouched dinner in front of him. Jay had invited someone to the party. An acquaintance. Another relationship that took precedence over whatever undefined thing existed between them.
It was unreasonable to feel jealous. Ian pushed his plate away and tried to talk himself out of the feeling, but the jealousy remained, petty and insistent, making him feel small and selfish and utterly pathetic.
He went to bed early, trying not to acknowledge how desperately he wanted to be the only person Jay thought to invite to important occasions. Trying not to admit how much he wanted Jay's time, attention, and affection to be his alone.
Chapter 43: The celebration
Scene 1
Gold lions and carved dragons
Jay had never been to Leo's office before. He half-expected gold lions on the furniture, carved dragons, maybe even a water feature. Instead, he found a plain desk and a neat bookshelf. Almost aggressively normal.
"Something wrong?" Leo asked from behind his desk.
"No, I just—I expected something different."
"Like what? A throne?"
"Maybe."
Leo laughed. "My father has the throne room. I just needed somewhere to hide when he's being insufferable. Sit. What's this about?"
"I need an extra invitation. For someone named Eli."
Leo's eyebrow arched immediately, theatrically suspicious. "Eli? And who is this mysterious Eli?"
"Someone who's been kind to me. I want to pay them back."
"By inviting him to Ian's birthday party. Interesting choice."
"Is it a problem?"
"Not at all. I'll have an invitation prepared. Anything else?" 
"No. Thank you."
"You're very welcome. This is going to be a spectacular party, Jay. You'll see."
Jay left before Leo could ask any more questions.
That evening Jay called his mother. The conversation started with pleasantries—how was work, how was the apartment, had he been eating properly—before moving to the real reason for the call.
"Tim's birthday is coming up. I've been looking at cars, but the selection here is limited."
"I can look in the city. There's probably more variety."
"Would you? That would help so much."
They spent the next hour building a list: brands known for reliability, models that fit the budget, features that mattered. His mother wanted something safe. Jay wanted something that wouldn't break down every other month. Tim, apparently, wanted something that didn't look like it belonged to someone's grandfather.
"That narrows it down," Jay said dryly.
His mother laughed. "He's eighteen. He'll be happy with anything that runs and doesn't embarrass him."
"I'll see what I can find," Jay promised.
"Thank you, sweetheart. I don't know what we'd do without you."
Jay said goodbye and set his phone down, staring at the list of car models she had sent. He could do this. It was just research.
Friday dinners with Ian had become the highlight of Jay’s week. The previous one had been canceled for Tia’s welcome party, leaving him unsure whether the tradition would continue or if it had dissolved for good. When Ian stopped by his desk that afternoon to invite him out, relief rushed through him so fast he had to pause before answering.
The restaurant was different this time, but it had the same inviting atmosphere, the same sense of being in a place that felt like theirs.
“How’s your week been?” Ian asked once they’d ordered.
"Busy. I'm helping my mother look for a car. For Tim's birthday."
"That's thoughtful of you."
"The selection in their town is terrible. I figured I'd look here instead."
"I know someone."
"Of course you do."
"A reputable dealer," Ian continued, ignoring the faint sarcasm. "I can arrange an appointment. He owes me a favor."
"You don't have to—"
"It's no trouble. Give me the list of models you're considering, and I'll have him pull together options."
Jay pulled out his phone and showed Ian the notes from the call. 
"I'll call him. You should hear from him by Monday."
"Thank you."
"It's nothing," Ian said.
They ate and talked about work, neither of them paying real attention to the details. The joy of being together filled the space more than the words did. When they finally got up to leave, Jay looked at Ian with that helplessly tender expression he never noticed himself making, and Ian wanted to hold onto that look forever.
Saturday morning at the gym, Rus greeted Jay with amusement clear on his face.
"You won't believe this. Luc contacted me yesterday. About the party," Rus said.
"What about it?" Jay asked.
"Apparently he's arranging clothes for all of us. The whole gym group. He wants to make sure we're appropriately dressed. Do these rich people think we're going to show up with clubs and pelts?"
Jay laughed. "I don't think that's it."
"Well, we're getting fitted next week. It'll be a circus."
"Probably," Jay agreed.
Rus clapped him on the shoulder. "Don't worry about Ema, by the way. We've all got her back. She'll be safe."
"I know," Jay said, but it didn't stop the knot in his stomach from tightening every time he thought about it.
"Also, we got a group gift for your boss. It's good. Really good."
"What is it?"
"Not telling."
Jay groaned. "You're all impossible."
"We're delightful. Now stop stalling and get on the treadmill."
Saturday evening Jay was elbow-deep in tinctures when Leo appeared at his door without warning.
Jay sighed. "What do you want?"
"I brought Eli's invitation," Leo said, holding up an envelope. Then he stopped, taking in the kitchen. "What is all this?"
The kitchen looked like an apothecary had exploded. Bottles covered every surface—some full of dark liquid, others pale amber, still more in various stages of infusion. Jars of herbs and spices lined the counter. The beautiful crystal bottles Jay had ordered sat in their protective packaging, waiting to be filled. Notes covered in Jay's handwriting were scattered across the table.
"It's nothing."
"This is not nothing. This is a production facility." Leo picked up one of the experimental jars. "What are you making?"
Jay snatched it back. "Ian's birthday gift. And you're not touching anything."
"Can I try it?"
"No."
"Come on. Just a taste."
"No. It's for Ian. I won't let you taint Ian's gift with your meddling paws."
"You know, I'm starting to think you like him."
Jay stilled for a second before resuming his work. "He's my boss."
"Sure. Your boss. Who you make artisan liqueurs for."
"It's a gift. For his birthday."
"And it's very sweet. Painfully, devastatingly sweet."
Leo wandered around the kitchen, inspecting labels, asking questions about ingredients, and generally making himself at home. Eventually he dropped onto the couch and started rattling off details about the party. He left an hour later and Jay returned to his bottles.
Monday morning Jay slipped out of the office during a quiet stretch and crossed the street to the boutique. Eli was arranging a display near the window and looked up when the door chimed.
"Jay. Back so soon?"
"I brought the invitation for the party, if you still want to come."
Eli took the envelope as though it might dissolve in his hands. He opened it, read it, and then looked up with awe.
"You really invited me," Eli said.
"I said I would."
"I know, but—This is incredible. Thank you."
"It's just a party."
"It's not just a party. Not from what I've heard. What are you getting him?"
"Why do you want to know?"
"Because I need to get him something too. Standard courtesy for attending someone's birthday celebration. And while it's well-known that he likes good alcohol and classical music, you probably know him better. Any insights?"
"He's very into fitness and spends a lot of time at the gym. And he loves his work."
"That's not exactly helpful for gift ideas."
"I know. He's difficult to buy for. Everything he wants, he already has. Everything he needs, he's already arranged for himself."
"So you're going with alcohol?"
"Something like that. But classical music is always safe. Recordings, concert tickets, music-related items. He appreciates quality in that area."
They chatted pleasantly for a few more minutes—Eli asking about Jay's work, Jay learning that Eli had been at Hathaway's for four years and enjoyed the customer interaction. Jay was relieved that Eli seemed nice. Not pushy, not inappropriately curious, just friendly. Maybe inviting him hadn't been reckless after all.
The car dealership meeting happened later that week. Ian's contact was a middle-aged man with no interest in overselling. He listened to Jay's requirements, consulted his inventory, and promised to find something from the shortlist.
"Good price, excellent condition. I'll contact you with options."
"Thank you."
"Ian vouched for you. That's enough for me."
Another problem solved, another piece falling into place. And then, before Jay even registered the passing days, the final week before the party was already at his door.
Jay sat on his couch surrounded by three bottles. He had chosen the best of his tinctures, the ones with the clearest flavours. He had tucked them into the wooden box, and written a note describing each one. He stared at the box, willing his heart to slow down. He wanted this to be perfect. He wanted Ian to like it, to understand how much thought had gone into every step.
He definitely wanted too much.
Scene 2
Incandescent
It was raining on Tuesday. Not the gentle autumn drizzle that made everything seem romantic, but a relentless downpour that turned the streets into rivers.
At six, Ian appeared at Jay's desk. "Ready to go?"
"Yeah."
They drove through the rain in silence. Jay watched the water run down the window and felt an odd weight in his chest.
"We have to  cancel the run," Ian said.
"I was looking forward to it," Jay replied. He was unreasonably disappointed. Now the evening stretched ahead, empty.
"So was I."
"Next week."
"Yes. Next week."
Ian pulled up outside Jay's building, and Jay hesitated before getting out.
"Thanks for the ride."
"Of course."
Jay walked inside, shook off his coat, and stood in the middle of his apartment feeling restless and gloomy. The rain drummed against the windows. It felt like a bad omen.
Wednesday afternoon, Leo cornered him at work.
"Jay. A word."
Jay followed Leo to his office, already suspicious.
"I've arranged everything for your sister's visit, just like I promised," Leo said, looking far too pleased with himself.
"What do you mean, everything?"
"The car will pick up Ema and her friend on Friday evening. They'll stay with you Friday night. Saturday morning, someone will collect them for the shopping trip—dresses, shoes, accessories. Then makeup and hair. They'll be delivered directly to the venue Saturday evening."
Jay stared at him. "Leo, that's too much—"
"Nonsense. They're your guests. They should arrive properly prepared."
"I can't afford—"
"It's my gift to them. And to you. Don't argue."
"The dresses need to be conservative. Age-appropriate."
Leo's smile was cherubic and utterly untrustworthy. "Of course."
"Leo."
"I promise. Nothing scandalous. They'll look elegant and appropriate."
Jay didn't believe him for a second, but arguing was pointless. Leo had already set everything in motion, and reversing it would cause more chaos than letting it proceed.
Wednesday evening, Jay called his mother.
"Everything's arranged. Leo's sending a car to pick them up Friday evening. They'll stay with me, then get taken care of on Saturday. Dresses, hair, makeup. Everything."
"That's very generous."
"I know it's a lot—"
"It's fine, Jay. If that's what's happening, then that's what's happening. I'll make sure they're ready Friday."
She sounded tired. Resigned. Jay wondered how many arguments she'd already had with Ema about this.
"Thanks, Mum."
After they hung up, Jay sat with his phone and stared at the wall. This was happening. Ema was coming. In three days, his sister would be at Ian's birthday party, dressed like she belonged in high society. He really hoped this wasn't a mistake.
Friday evening, the girls arrived in a flurry of giggles and enthusiasm. Jay opened the door to find Ema and Lam on the threshold, both talking at once, dragging enormous suitcases behind them.
"Jay!" Ema threw herself at him in a hug. "This is so exciting! The car was so fancy! There was bottled water and everything!"
"Hi, Ema."
"And Lam's never been to the city before, have you, Lam?"
Lam shook her head, wide-eyed. "It's huge."
"Come in," Jay said, stepping aside. "The bedroom is yours for tonight. I'll sleep on the couch."
"Really? You're the best brother ever!" Ema dragged Lam toward the bedroom. "Come on, let's unpack!"
The bedroom door flew open, the suitcases exploded across the bed, and clothes scattered everywhere. Music started playing from someone's phone. Shrieking laughter echoed through the flat.
Jay retreated to the balcony with a cup of tea. The rain had stopped, but the air still felt damp. Inside, the girls chattered endlessly about dresses and makeup and what the party would be like. Jay could hear them through the glass door.
The weekly Friday dinner with Ian was naturally cancelled. Too much happening, too many complications. Jay tried not to feel disappointed about it, but that absence felt like another bad omen.
He slept on the couch—or tried to sleep while giggling continued from his bedroom until midnight. Eventually exhaustion won and he drifted off to the sound of whispered conversations and occasional bursts of laughter.
Saturday morning, the car arrived at eleven sharp. Leo's driver was patient, waiting while the girls gathered their things and took final photos in Jay's apartment. Ema hugged Jay before leaving.
"I'll be good. I won't embarrass you."
"I know."
"And whatever you're wearing tonight, you're going to look amazing."
"Have fun."
He watched them drive away, feeling like a worried parent sending children off to their first day of school.
His phone buzzed. A message from Leo. "Small list of errands. Need these done before tonight."
The attached document was three pages long.
Jay scrolled through it in disbelief. Half the tasks were meaningless. Picking up items that could have been delivered. Confirming details that had already been confirmed twice. Dropping off materials at locations across the city. It was busywork. Pure sabotage.
He texted back: "Why?"
Leo's response came immediately: "Just trust me."
Jay didn't trust him at all. 
At three, Jay met Eli at the salon.
"Right on time. Come in. We've got two hours."
Two hours felt excessive. He sat in the chair and let Eli's team take over.
They started with his hair—washing, cutting, styling until it looked deliberately tousled but somehow elegant. Then the outfit. Jay changed into the floral blazer, the open-collar shirt, the perfectly fitted trousers. Eli adjusted the fit, made minute changes until everything sat exactly right.
"Perfect," Eli said finally, stepping back. "You look incredible."
"You're sure about the open collar?"
"I'm certain. It's sophisticated, not sloppy. Trust the vision. Ian Hagen is going to forget how to speak."
"That's not the goal."
"Then what is the goal?"
"To look... appropriate. Not like I'm trying too hard."
"You don't look like you're trying too hard. You look like you succeeded without trying at all. There's a difference." Eli handed him a small tube. "Lip balm. Use it before you leave tonight. Trust me."
"Thank you. For all of this."
"My pleasure. This is what I do. See you at the party?"
"See you there."
Jay left the salon and immediately started on the final errands. He took a taxi across town, picked up whatever Leo had ordered, then headed to another location for another pointless task. By seven, he was still running around, increasingly irritated.
He texted Rus: "Going to be late. Can you watch the girls?"
Rus replied immediately with a thumbs up.
Jay finished the last errand at seven-forty-five and finally headed to the venue. The party had started without him. He was over an hour late. He arrived at eight-ten, breathless and annoyed, holding the silver-and-gold wrapped package with its red ribbon.
The venue was stunning. A historic building with soaring ceilings, marble floors, and chandeliers that cast mystical light across everything. And people—so many people, dressed in expensive suits and gowns, holding glasses of champagne, talking and laughing.
The entrance hall opened onto a wide staircase that descended into the main space. Jay walked down, holding his gift, still catching his breath.
The crowd noticed him immediately. Conversations paused. Heads turned.
Jay walked down the staircase, acutely aware of every eye on him. He reached the bottom and headed straight for the gift table, setting his package down among the others. Then he scanned the room, looking for Ian.
Near the centre of the room, Ian turned. He froze. He forgot the party. Forgot the noise, the crowd, the obligation of the evening. He forgot why he'd been irritated moments before. Jay looked incandescent.
Jay crossed the room, weaving through the crowd, and stopped in front of Ian.
"Happy birthday," Jay said.
Ian stared at him, seemingly unable to speak.
"I know I'm late. Leo's errands. I'm sorry."
"You're—" Ian stopped, cleared his throat. "You look—"
"Ridiculous?"
"No. Not ridiculous."
The guests around them had diplomatically moved away, giving them space. Jay barely noticed.
"I hope you're enjoying the party. I know you didn't want this. But everyone here cares about you. They want to celebrate you. I wanted you to have a night where people remind you how much you matter. Because you do. You matter so much."
He hadn't meant to say it like that. Hadn't meant to be so earnest, so open. But the words were already out, and Ian was looking at him like Jay had just said something devastating.
"Thank you," Ian said.
Jay wanted to say more—to explain how important Ian had become, how much these two years had meant—but the words wouldn't come.
"I should let you get back to your guests," Jay said finally.
"Jay—"
"Happy birthday, Ian."
Jay stepped back, giving Ian space to return to the crowd. But Ian's eyes followed him, and Jay felt the weight of that attention even as he moved away.
Scene 3
Ian's world
Jay's first priority after wishing Ian happy birthday was finding Ema.
He scanned the crowd and spotted her immediately—impossible to miss in a deep blue gown with intricate black lace that looked like it had been stolen from a Victorian drama. Rus stood beside her like a wolfhound guarding a princess, and Van loomed behind them both like a gothic gargoyle carved from stone and suspicion.
Jay approached quickly. "Ema."
"Jay!" Ema beamed, spinning to show off the dress. "Look at this! Isn't it amazing?"
"It's very dramatic."
"It's beautiful," Ema corrected. She gestured to Lam, who wore a similarly theatrical gown in rose with velvet accents. "We look like we stepped out of a period film."
"You do," Jay admitted. The dresses were glamorous, absurdly over the top, and—to his immense relief—perfectly modest. High necklines, long sleeves, full skirts. Leo had actually kept his promise.
"Leo's stylist said we needed something special. Something memorable. She showed us these and we fell in love immediately." Ema spun, the skirt flowing dramatically. "I feel like a princess in a historical romance."
"You look like one too." Jay turned to Rus. "Thank you for watching them."
"No problem. Van and I have it covered. No one's getting near them without going through us first."
"I appreciate that."
The girls launched into an excited breakdown of their entire day—shopping, makeup, hair, the car ride, the moment they walked into the venue and realized how enormous the party was. Jay listened, half-relieved and half-exhausted, until he could politely extract himself.
"I need to find Leo," Jay said.
"Good luck," Rus said.
Jay found Leo near the bar, sipping champagne and looking thoroughly pleased with himself.
"Leo," Jay said.
"Jay," Leo said warmly. "You look fantastic."
"You said a hundred people. Close friends. Small gathering."
"Did I?"
"Yes."
"Hm. Must have miscounted."
"There are at least five hundred people here. This isn't a party. It's a gala."
"It's a celebration," Leo corrected.
"There are politicians here. Clients. I saw someone from the finance ministry."
"Ian knows a lot of people."
"This is ridiculous. You said small. You said intimate. You said—"
"Look around," Leo interrupted, gesturing to the room.
Jay stopped talking and actually looked.
The venue was massive—chandeliers dripping with crystal, floral arrangements that must've cost thousands, a string quartet playing near the far wall. The guest list was drawn from every tier of power and influence. Politicians, business leaders, old money families. But also artists, writers, people in extravagant clothing who clearly didn't care what anyone thought.
A surprising number of people were unabashedly, flamboyantly queer—men in glittering jackets, women in sharp suits, couples holding hands.
Jay had expected something elegant and restrained. Instead, this was Ian's actual world—enormous, distinguished, glittering. Unapologetic.
Jay's nerves spiked. He was so far out of his depth here. These were people who belonged in spaces like this, who moved through such events with natural grace. And Jay was just someone who'd needed a clothing clerk to tell him how to dress appropriately.
Then he stopped himself. This was Ian's world. Of course it looked like this. Of course Ian moved in circles that were massive and complicated and full of people who lived lives Jay couldn't even imagine. That didn't mean Jay didn't belong here. It meant he had to live up to the occasion.
He took a breath and turned back to Leo. "Fine."
Leo smiled. "See? Not so bad."
"It's terrifying," Jay said.
"You'll be fine."
Jay found Ian by the buffet table, momentarily alone. He approached quickly, before someone else could claim Ian's attention.
"Ian, I'm sorry," Jay said.
Ian looked at him, surprised. "For what?"
"For pushing the party idea. I didn't realize it would be this big. This formal. If I'd known—"
"Jay, stop."
"But you're tense. I can see it."
"I'm always tense at these things. But it's fine. I'm used to it. This isn't so different from charity galas or industry events. Just with more people I actually like."
"You're sure?"
"I'm sure."
Before Jay could respond, a group of guests approached—older men, clearly friends from Ian's past. They swept Ian into conversation, and Jay stepped back, letting him go.
Jay drifted between circles, checking on Ema every fifteen minutes, talking with his coworkers. The team had scattered throughout the venue, each finding their own corner. He found Rin clinging to Luc like a lifeline near the edge of the dance floor.
"You okay?" Jay asked.
"Too many people," Rin muttered.
"You'll survive," Luc said cheerfully. "Just breathe."
Ela and Kim were on the dance floor, laughing and spinning. Even Ray was there, standing stiffly near the wall with a glass of wine, looking like someone had forced him to attend at gunpoint. Jay suspected Leo might actually have threatened him. It was the only explanation.
Max, Amy, and Liv had brought their spouses. Max's wife wore loads of jewellery and laughed as loudly as Max did. Amy's husband looked serious and vaguely unhappy to be there. Liv's husband surprised Jay—long hair, multiple piercings, an air of mild boredom. They stood in a group of six, chatting animatedly.
Zoe stood in a corner chatting with a group of people who were aggressively, gloriously flamboyant—sequins, bold makeup. She looked completely at ease. Tia stood near the bar with a glass of whiskey, looking slightly awkward.
"Tia," Jay said.
"Jay," she said, relieved. "Thank god. I don't know anyone here."
"You know me," Jay said. "Come on."
He led Tia over to where Rus and Van stood guard over the girls. Ema and Lam were still chattering excitedly, but Rus and Van looked like sentries on duty.
"Tia, this is Rus and Van. They're friends. You all have military backgrounds. You'll get along."
Tia's expression brightened immediately. "You were in the service?"
They launched into conversation immediately, trading stories about bases and deployments and the particular insanity of military logistics. Tia's awkwardness vanished within minutes.
Jay turned back to the dance floor and froze.
Luc had Ema on the dance floor, spinning her around, laughing. Mic was entertaining Lam nearby, gesturing wildly while she giggled. Jay shot them both pointed glances.
Rus appeared at his side. "Relax. Luc's harmless. And Mic might be a menace, but he wouldn't go after little girls."
"You're sure?"
"Positive. They're just having fun."
Jay watched for another moment. Rus was right. Luc was being perfectly appropriate, just friendly. And Mic, despite his reputation, kept a respectful distance from Lam.
Still, Jay didn't relax. 
The party was loud, lively, full of laughter and music. People danced. People talked. People drank champagne and ate from the elaborate buffet. And Jay moved through it all, keeping track of everyone, making sure Ema and Lam were safe, checking that the team was comfortable, watching Ian from across the room whenever he could.
He didn't relax for a second. He couldn't shake the feeling that if something went wrong, it would somehow be his fault.
Scene 4
Not boyfriend
At ten, the lights dimmed. A hush fell over the crowd as staff wheeled out the cake.
It was monumental. Excessive. Four tiers of dark chocolate, decorated with sugar flowers that looked too delicate to be real. The crowd pressed closer, phones appearing to capture the moment.
Then the fireworks started.
Jay hadn't expected fireworks. Nobody had mentioned fireworks. But suddenly the patio doors were thrown open, and the night sky erupted in colour—gold, silver, red, cascading patterns that lit up the entire venue.
The crowd gasped, applauded, cheered. Jay stood frozen, watching the display, feeling the absurdity of it all. This wasn't a birthday party. This was a spectacle.
When the fireworks ended, a figure stepped onto the small stage. Jay recognized them immediately—everyone did. A vaudeville star, legendary in certain circles, someone whose name appeared in theater programs and cultural retrospectives. They smiled, raised their arms theatrically, and began singing.
"Happy birthday to you..."
Half the guests squealed. Actual squealing. Jay watched in disbelief as grown adults reacted like they'd just seen their favorite celebrity. Which, he supposed, they had.
The song ended to thunderous applause. Then the stage lights came up fully, revealing an entire orchestra—not the small string quartet from earlier, but a full ensemble. They launched into a sweeping, theatrical piece, and the crowd erupted again.
Ian stood near the center of the patio, looking uncomfortable and vaguely trapped, but when the song ended, he smiled and raised his glass in acknowledgement.
Ray escaped shortly after the cake. Jay spotted him slipping toward the exit, relief visible on his face even from across the room. Jay didn't blame him. He was half-tempted to flee himself.
But he had responsibilities. Ema, the team, Ian, so he stayed.
As the night continued, the atmosphere loosened. Couples drifted into corners, old friends reunited with animated conversation, the music swelled and changed to something more lively. 
Jay checked on Ian repeatedly. Each time he approached, Ian's expression brightened—just slightly, just enough for Jay to notice.
"How are you holding up?" Jay asked during one check-in.
"Surviving."
"That's all we can ask."
Ian almost smiled. "How's Ema?"
"Thriving. I think she's having the time of her life."
"Good. That's good."
Someone called Ian's name from across the room, and he was pulled away again. Jay watched him go, then returned to his orbit—checking guests, monitoring the atmosphere, ensuring everything ran smoothly.
At eleven-thirty, Jay was near a group of Ian's old friends—elegant people in their forties and fifties, holding wine glasses. One of them spotted Jay and smiled. "You must be Jay."
"I am."
"Ian's told us about you. Though he didn't mention how spectacular you are. Your new boyfriend is very impressive, Ian."
Jay went scarlet. "I'm not—we're not—"
"Jay is my assistant. Not my boyfriend."
The friend laughed, delighted. "Oh, my apologies. Well then, are you available? Because if Ian's foolish enough not to claim you, I'd be delighted to—"
Jay felt his face burn hotter. "I'm absolutely not."
The words came out more forcefully than he intended. The friend raised his hands in mock surrender, still smiling. "Fair enough. Can't blame me for asking."
Ian wanted to excuse himself. He wanted to pull Jay into some secluded corner and kiss him breathless. He wanted to do a hundred things he'd never be allowed to do. The thought sent a sharp pain through his entire body.
Around midnight, Jay spotted Eli in the crowd. He was looking thrilled to be there, and when he saw Jay, he immediately approached.
"Jay! This is incredible. Thank you so much for the invitation."
"I'm glad you like it."
"Are you kidding? This is the event of the season. Everyone's talking about it." Eli gestured to the room. "The orchestra, the fireworks, the guest list—it's spectacular."
"Leo went all out."
"He certainly did. I should thank your employer. For allowing me to attend."
"Come on, I'll introduce you."
Jay found Ian near the bar and brought Eli over. "Ian, this is Eli. He's the stylist who helped with my outfit tonight."
Ian extended his hand. "A pleasure. You did excellent work."
Eli shook his hand, looking slightly starstruck. "Thank you, Mr. Hagen. It was my honor. Jay was already a perfect canvas—I just helped him shine."
"You succeeded admirably."
Eli practically glowed. "If you ever need styling services, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'd be delighted to assist."
"I'll keep that in mind."
He departed with a final nod to Jay.
"The acquaintance you mentioned?" Ian asked.
"Yes. He's helped me multiple times with styling advice. I wanted to thank him."
"By bringing him to my birthday party."
"Is that alright? I know I should have asked more specifically—"
"It's fine. You're thoughtful about the people who help you. That's characteristic."
Before Jay could respond, a woman in an expensive gown approached—apparently a city councillor who wanted to discuss potential new projects. Ian was pulled back into conversation, and Jay stepped away to give them space.
Across the room, Ema and Lam had found a table full of flamboyant men who were absolutely delighted by their Victorian gowns. Jay watched as they launched into an animated discussion about makeup techniques, historical fashion, and the best ways to achieve dramatic effects.
The men were patient, enthusiastic, treating the girls like fellow enthusiasts. Ema was asking questions, showing photos on her phone, absorbing every piece of advice.
Jay checked with Rus, who was still standing guard nearby.
"They're fine. Theatre people, I think. They're having a blast."
"As long as they're safe."
"They're safe. Stop worrying."
Jay tried to take the advice. He really did.
The night continued, endless and exhausting. Jay kept orbiting Ian, drawn back to him again and again even as the crowd kept them apart. Each time their eyes met across the room, something passed between them—acknowledgment, reassurance, connection.
They barely spoke. There was no time, too many guests demanding Ian's attention. But Jay felt the pull anyway, the invisible thread that kept bringing him back.
Ian noticed the orbits. Jay could tell by the way Ian's gaze tracked him, by the way Ian's expression eased slightly whenever Jay came into view. Like Jay mattered. Like it made the night slightly more bearable.
At two in the morning, the party was still going, though the crowd had thinned. Jay finally gathered Ema and Lam, who were exhausted but exhilarated.
"That was the best night of my life," Ema said, leaning heavily on Jay as they walked to the car.
"I'm glad."
"Everyone was so nice. And the dresses, and the dancing, and those men who talked about makeup—Jay, it was perfect."
"I'm happy you enjoyed it."
Lam was quieter, but her face glowed. "Thank you for bringing us."
"Of course."
During the taxi ride home Ema and Lam dozed against each other in the back seat. Jay stared out the window. They'd survived. The party had been a success. Ema was happy. Nobody had been hurt or disappointed.
Back at his apartment, the girls stumbled to the bedroom with mumbled goodnight. He texted his mother: "Evening went perfectly. Everyone behaved. The girls had an amazing time. We're home safe."
He removed his outfit, hanging everything carelessly, too tired to do more than basic care, then collapsed onto the couch, bone-tired but still wired from the evening.
Scene 5
You deserve every good thing
Ian arrived home at four in the morning, drained and irritated.
The party had been too much. The attention suffocating. The splendour absurd. Five hundred people wishing him well, wanting his time. The cake, the fireworks, the orchestra—all of it excessive beyond reason.
But Jay… Jay had looked beautiful. Devastating. Walking down those stairs like something out of a dream.
Jay had kept coming back to him, checking on him, seeking him out even in the crush of the crowd. Jay had rejected everyone else who approached him, every subtle and not-so-subtle advance deflected with a simple, definitive no.
Ian dropped his keys on the counter and looked around his living room.
The gifts were already there, arranged by the staff Leo had hired to handle the logistics. Elegant boxes, wrapped packages, things chosen by assistants or purchased out of obligation. Ian ignored all of them and went straight to the one that mattered. The silver-and-gold package with the red ribbon. Jay's gift. The ribbons Jay had chosen made it distinctive among the more elaborate presentations. Ian took it to his kitchen table and sat, just looking at it for a long moment.
Then he unwrapped it, preserving the ribbons, revealing a beautiful wooden box beneath. He opened it to find three crystal bottles and a handwritten note. Ian picked it up and read.
Ian,
I made these for you. Each one for a different moment:
The first—citrus, ginger, cardamom. For cold evenings when you need warmth.
The second—alpine herbs, gentian, chamomile. For when you're tired and need clarity.
The third—red currant, cinnamon, honey. This one reminded me of my childhood. My grandfather made something similar. I hope it brings you comfort. 
Happy birthday. You deserve every good thing.
—Jay
Ian read it twice, then a third time, tracing the handwriting with his eyes.
Each one tailored to him. Each one infused with meaning. He picked up the bottle of red currant tincture and opened it. He poured a small amount into a glass and took a sip.
It was sweet and warm, just like Jay. Rich with spice and fruit, smooth on the tongue.
Ian closed his eyes and let the warmth spread through him. It probably tastes like his lips, Ian thought, and the thought hit him with such sharp longing that he had to set the glass down. 
He fell asleep on the couch, still holding the note, glowing despite the exhaustion. The evening wasn't so bad after all.
Ian slept in the next day. He woke at noon to someone knocking persistently on his door. Ian dragged himself upright, disoriented and annoyed, and went to answer it. Leo stood in the hallway.
"Good morning, sunshine."
"What do you want?"
"Just checking on the birthday boy. Making sure you survived the festivities."
"I'm fine. Go away."
"Let me in. I brought coffee."
Ian considered closing the door in his face. But Leo was already pushing past him, carrying two cups from the café down the street.
"You look terrible," Leo said cheerfully, handing him a cup.
"I was asleep."
"At noon? That's not like you."
"I got home at four."
"Fair enough. So. What did you think?"
"It was excessive."
"It was great."
"It was too much, Leo. Five hundred people—"
"Who all care about you. Who all wanted to celebrate you. Stop being ungrateful."
"Fine. It was impressive. Thank you."
"Better. Now, let me try one of Jay's tinctures."
"No."
"Come on. Just a taste."
"Absolutely not."
"Ian—"
"No. They're mine."
Leo laughed, delighted. "You're being territorial. How charming."
"They're a gift. I'm not sharing."
"Fine, fine. But you should know—Jay made those with so much care. Months of trial and error. He turned his entire apartment into a laboratory. Probably three dozen batches before he settled on the final versions. You should have seen him guarding those jars like a dragon protecting treasure. He wouldn't let me sample anything. It was adorable."
"He didn't need to go to that much effort."
"Of course he did. He adores you."
"Leo—"
"You know, I'm surprised you two haven't consummated your obvious union yet."
"Get out," Ian said.
"I'm just saying—"
"Leo."
"Fine, fine. Though really, Ian. The way he looks at you. The way you look at him. It's rather remarkable that you've both maintained this facade."
Ian physically moved Leo toward the door. "Out."
Leo left clearly pleased with himself.
Ian stood in the quiet afterwards, holding the bottle Jay had made for him, feeling undeserving and overwhelmingly lucky.
Leo's unsavoury comments about consummation were ridiculous—Jay's intentions were almost certainly not that carnal. But the sweetness was there regardless. The gentle, tender care that made Ian's chest constrict painfully. He set the bottle down and wondered what he'd done to deserve someone like Jay in his life.
Jay woke up Sunday morning to the sound of the girls already awake and eager to explore.
"Can we go shopping?" Ema asked the moment Jay opened his eyes.
"It's eight in the morning," Jay said.
"Exactly. The stores will be open soon."
Jay sighed and made coffee.
They went shopping. Ema and Lam dragged him through half a dozen stores, exclaiming over clothes and makeup and accessories they couldn't afford but loved looking at. Jay bought them each something small. 
By early afternoon, Leo's driver arrived to take them home. The girls hugged Jay tightly, still buzzing with excitement.
"Thank you, Jay. This was the best weekend of my life."
"You're welcome."
"Will you visit us soon?"
"I'll try."
They climbed into the car, waving through the window as they pulled away. Jay watched them go, feeling exhausted. The weekend was over. The party was done. Now he had to face the aftermath.
He walked home slowly, thinking about Ian. The evening had been much more stressful than he'd thought. The scale, the crowd, the noise—it had been ridiculous. He couldn't shake the feeling that he'd done something wrong.
He'd wanted to bring joy into Ian's life. Instead, he'd brought a spectacle. He'd pushed Ian into the centre of attention, exactly where Ian didn't want to be. He'd turned a simple birthday into a massive, exhausting production. He was sure Ian was unhappy about that. Jay closed his eyes and sighed deeply. He'd have to make it up to him somehow. Apologize. Do something to fix whatever damage he'd caused.
Chapter 44: Afterglow
Scene 1
Early darkness
The fluorescent lights felt particularly harsh on Monday morning. Jay arrived at his desk skittish, bracing himself for whatever reaction Ian might have to the party. The weekend had been a spectacular excess, and now here he was again, surrounded by monitors and spreadsheets and the ordinary machinery of work.
Ian appeared at eight and walked past Jay's desk without stopping.
"Good morning."
"Good morning," Jay said.
That was all. Ian disappeared into his office, and Jay turned back to his screen, uncertain. He couldn’t tell whether Ian seemed annoyed or if he was projecting his own doubts onto him.
The morning workload was unusually heavy. Client requests needed immediate attention, and two international calls were scheduled before ten. The morning briefing was brief—squeezed between Ian's first and second call—and consisted mostly of Jay rattling off urgent items.
When they were done Jay left the office and returned to his desk. Ian looked exhausted. He was trying to hide it, but Jay could see the weariness, the strain. He wanted to talk to Ian. To explain, to apologize, to make amends for the spectacle of the party, but the workday consumed them both.
By noon, Jay had barely spoken to Ian again. The international calls ran long, and then there was an emergency meeting about a client complaint. At lunch, Jay joined the team at a nearby restaurant. The party was the main topic immediately.
"I'm telling you, the fireworks were overkill, but in the best possible way. Leo doesn't do anything by halves," Luc said. 
"The cake was incredible. I didn't even know they made cakes that tall," Ela added.
"Did you see the ice sculpture? It was an actual phoenix. How do you even carve that?" Kim asked.
Amy smiled. "My husband even admitted he enjoyed it. That's saying something."
"You looked good, Jay. Where did you even get that outfit? It was stunning," Liv asked.
"Thanks, a stylist helped me."
"Well, they knew what they were doing."
The conversation moved on, dissecting other details of the party—the orchestra, the guest list. Everyone agreed it had been a success. Jay listened and nodded and tried to feel reassured by that, but his thoughts kept returning to Ian's expression when the cake had been wheeled out. The way he'd stood there surrounded by five hundred people and looked miserable.
"You alright?" Luc asked.
Jay realized he'd been staring at his untouched sandwich. "Yeah. Just tired."
"It was a long weekend. I'm still recovering too."
The afternoon dragged. Ian's calls continued, one bleeding into the next, and Jay worked through spreadsheets and reports, trying not to watch the clock. By six, most of the office had cleared out. By seven, it was just him and Ian left on the floor.
Finally Jay got up and walked to Ian's office. The door was open. Ian was at his desk, typing something frantically. Jay knocked lightly on the door frame.
Ian looked up. "Yes?"
"Do you need anything else tonight?"
"No, I'm nearly finished here. You can head out if you'd like."
"Actually, I wanted to apologize."
"For what?"
"For the party. I should have pushed back more when Leo started planning everything. I didn't realize how out of hand it would get."
"Leo doesn't take well to being pushed back."
"I know, but still. Five hundred people and fireworks and a vaudeville star—it was too much. I'm sorry. I just—it got out of hand. I know you hate those kinds of events, and Leo turned it into a circus, and I should have—"
"You didn't force me to attend my own birthday party."
"No, but I encouraged it. And now you're stuck with—I don't know, a mountain of gifts you didn't want and probably a headache that hasn't gone away yet."
"Jay. I agreed to the party. I knew what Leo would do with it. You are not responsible for his excess."
"I wanted you to enjoy it. But you just looked tired."
"I was tired. Though I'll admit the aftermath is proving worse than the event itself."
"Aftermath?"
"My living room is now a warehouse. Gifts. Everywhere. I can't walk through it without tripping over something."
"You haven't unpacked them?"
"I opened yours. The rest can wait. Indefinitely, if I'm honest. The entire prospect depresses me."
"I can help with that. Next weekend isn't too busy for me. I can come over and sort everything out. Catalogue it, write thank-you notes if you want, whatever you need."
"You don't have to do that."
"I want to. It's my fault you're buried in gifts anyway."
"It's Leo's fault," Ian corrected, but he didn't argue further. "If you're offering, I won't refuse. Saturday afternoon?"
"That works."
"Good. Thank you, Jay."
"Of course."
Jay left the office feeling better. It wasn't much, but at least he could fix this one thing.
Tuesday's run started in the early evening, just as the sun was setting. The air was even cooler than it had been the week before, autumn asserting itself properly now. Jay pulled his jacket tighter as they started along the river path, and by the time they hit the halfway point, the light was almost gone.
They stopped near the water, both breathing hard. The air in front of them turned to fog with every exhale. Ian bent forward slightly, hands on his knees, and then straightened.
"It's getting dark earlier," Ian said.
"And colder. The weather was much more pleasant this time last year," Jay added.
Ian looked out at the river, where the last traces of daylight were fading. "We should probably pause these until spring. Running in the dark isn't ideal, and the temperature's only going to drop from here."
"Yeah, that makes sense."
"Reporting season starts soon anyway. We won't have the time."
"True."
They stood there for a moment longer, neither moving. The tradition had only been going for a few weeks, but it had become something Jay looked forward to. A reason to spend time with Ian outside the office that didn't require a business excuse.
"Spring, then," Jay said finally.
"Spring," Ian agreed.
When yhey walked back, the cold was biting at their exposed skin.
Thursday afternoon, Jay's phone rang with the car salesman's number.
"I'm still working on finding the right vehicle for your budget and specifications. I'll need another week, maybe a bit more."
"How much more?"
"Hard to say. The market's been tight lately, but I'll keep looking. I haven't let Mr. Hagen down yet, and I don't plan to start now."
"Alright. Thank you."
He hung up and stared at his calendar. Tim's birthday was in mid-October, and the quarter ended soon. Once reporting season hit, Jay's schedule would be a nightmare. He needed this sorted before then, but there wasn't much he could do except wait and hope the salesman's track record held.
Friday evening, Ian appeared at Jay's desk at seven o'clock.
"Ready?" he asked, as if there'd been any question about whether they'd have their weekly dinner.
"Yeah. Where are we going?" 
"That place near the canal." 
"The one with the brick oven?" 
"That's the one."
They didn't discuss further. The Friday dinners had resumed without needing to be renegotiated, slipping back into place as though the party weekend interruption never happened. Ian drove them to the restaurant with wooden tables and a menu that leaned toward game.
They ordered drinks first, and then Ian asked about the car search. Jay explained the delay, and Ian frowned slightly.
"He's reliable. If he says he needs more time, it's because he's being thorough."
"I know. I just—Tim's birthday is coming up, and I wanted to have it sorted before reporting season starts."
"You'll have it sorted. Even if it cuts close."
Jay nodded, trying to believe that.
They talked about work, the upcoming reports. Ian mentioned that Leo was already making noises about the annual gala, which wasn't until January but apparently required months of planning.
When the food arrived, Jay looked down at his plate with mild apprehension. He'd ordered something the waiter recommended, rabbit stew with juniper and chestnuts. The first bite was stronger than he'd expected, rich and almost too gamey, the flavor violently hitting the back of his throat.
He chewed and swallowed, trying not to grimace.
Ian was watching him, and the corner of his mouth lifted. "How is it?"
"It's... interesting."
"You hate it."
"I don't hate it."
"You don't have to finish it."
"I'm not going to waste it."
"Jay, it's food, not a moral failing."
Jay took another bite, forcing himself to chew and swallow. The taste didn't improve and the texture was dense, but he wasn't about to leave half a meal on his plate. Ian was definitely amused now, which only made Jay more determined to finish.
By the time the plate was empty, Jay felt slightly queasy, but at least it was done. Ian was still smiling, the faint kind of smile that softened his whole face.
"You're stubborn," Ian said.
"I don't like wasting things."
"Even when they taste like that?"
"Even then."
Ian shook his head, but he still looked amused. They finished their drinks and left, stepping out into the cool evening air. Ian drove Jay home, and they confirmed their plans for Saturday as the car idled outside Jay's building.
"Two o'clock?" Ian asked.
"I'll be there."
"Good. Thank you again for doing this."
"It's not a problem. Really."
He got out of the car and walked to the entrance, glancing back once to see Ian still waiting until he was inside. Jay waved, and Ian pulled away.
Scene 2
Thoughtful gifts
Jay arrived at Ian's building at exactly two o'clock. The lobby was as imposing as ever. The doorman recognized him now and waved him through without question, but Jay still felt discomfort every time he walked through those doors. This wasn't his world, no matter how many times Ian insisted otherwise.
Ian answered the door almost immediately, dressed in dark trousers and a plain sweater, more casual than Jay expected.
"Come in. Fair warning, it's worse than I described."
Jay stepped inside and stopped. The living room was unrecognizable. Wrapped boxes were stacked everywhere, covering the couch, the coffee table, even parts of the floor. Ribbons and bows and elegant wrapping paper in every conceivable colour.
"Oh," Jay said.
"Yes. Oh. I've been walking around them all week. It's humiliating."
"It's not that bad."
"It's a monument to wealth and excess. People trying to impress me with expensive nonsense I don't want or need."
"We'll sort it out."
"Thank you. I don't think I could've faced this alone."
"We need a system. Sorting first, then unwrapping, then logging who gave what so you can send thank-you notes."
Ian looked at the mountain of presents, then at Jay. "That's going to take hours."
"Then we'd better start."
They set up on the floor, clearing a space in the centre of the room. Ian passed boxes over, while Jay organized them into rough categories by size. It felt strangely intimate—sitting close together on the carpet, surrounded by wrapping paper.
Ian made commentary about each giver. "That's from the Wilsons. They always give crystal. I think they own stock in a glassware company."
Jay unwrapped an elaborate vase. "It's nice crystal, at least."
"It's the fourth vase they've given me."
"What do you do with four vases?"
"Regift them."
They continued. Box after box, gift after gift. Some were thoughtful—uncommon books, quality liquor, things clearly chosen with care. Most were generic—gift baskets, accessories, items selected by assistants, expensive but impersonal. Some were just terrible.
"What is this?" Jay held up a gold-plated pen holder shaped like a swan.
Ian stared at it. "I have no idea."
"It's hideous."
"Put it in the donation pile."
Halfway through the pile, Jay unwrapped a package to find a hoodie with a gym logo and an envelope. He read the card aloud.
"From Rus and the company. It says you need to unwind more. Take your assistant to the sauna and show him how it's done properly. Included: two-person exclusive sauna package voucher. That's—they didn't need to—"
"They're unexpectedly thoughtful. I didn't expect a sauna package."
"I have the same hoodie. I got it at the gym for my one-year anniversary. Now we have matching hoodies."
"That's nice."
Jay set the hoodie aside, still flustered. Matching hoodies. He doubted Ian would ever wear it, but the idea still made his heart race. 
The next gift was a slim envelope, decorated with stickers and hearts. Jay opened it and groaned.
"What is it?" Ian asked.
"From Ema and Lam. Tickets for a spring botanical garden night. In the city where I went to university. They say I can show you around and you'll definitely love it."
Jay felt his face burn. The gift was sweet, and the wishes were cheesy and enthusiastic, but it felt mildly inappropriate, like a thing you gave to a couple, not to a boss and his assistant. He glanced at Ian, ready to apologize for his sister's presumption.
Ian was staring at the ticket, his expression unexpectedly bright.
"A botanical garden at night. I've always wanted to go to something like this, but the opportunity never presented itself. If you're comfortable with it, I'd very much like to go."
"Really?"
"It's novel. Different. But only if you're alright with it. I know it's asking you to take time and travel."
"Of course I'm willing. I just didn't think you'd want to."
"I do. Very much."
Ian set the tickets aside in a spot where they wouldn't get lost. Internally, he was praising Ema for engineering such a perfect excuse for a weekend with Jay. The girl was a genius. This was even better than the sauna voucher from Rus.
The next box was ornate, wrapped in gold paper with an absurdly large bow.
"Oh my god," Jay said.
Inside, nestled in layers of velvet, was an antique brooch. It was enormous, the size of Jay's palm, with intricate gold filigree and a sapphire in the centre so large it looked fake. Except it wasn't fake. It was absolutely, unmistakably real. Gaudy, extravagant, absolutely ridiculous.
"It's from Leo." 
Jay stared at it. Then he started laughing. He couldn't help it. The absurdity of the thing, the sheer ridiculousness of Leo spending two weeks hunting for this monstrosity across multiple countries, all while Jay had been agonizing over whether his homemade tinctures were good enough. He laughed until his sides hurt, collapsing back against the couch.
Ian looked unamused. "It's probably insanely expensive."
"It's hideous."
Jay rolled on the floor, still laughing. "He made me so anxious. I thought my gift was going to look pathetic next to whatever he found, and he comes back with this."
Ian picked up the brooch, examining it critically. "Your gift was better."
Jay sat up, wiping his eyes. "You're just saying that."
"I'm not. Your gift was the best. Well, second best. Right after your sister's gift."
They continued working through the pile, boxes opened, gifts logged, wrapping paper collected into bags. By the time they finished, two empty coffee cups sat on the table, and they were both sprawled on the floor amid the debris.
"I'm sorry this was such a hassle," Jay said.
"You've apologized enough."
"I feel responsible."
"If you truly want to make it up to me, take vacation time without grimacing."
Jay groaned. "Not this again."
"You need rest. You should plan it as penance for the party."
"I'm not going unless you take time off too."
"Spending a week at home is depressing. I don't want to do it."
"Then don't spend it at home."
"I don't have anywhere to go."
They reached a standstill, both stubborn, neither willing to budge. Jay lay on the floor, staring at the ceiling, and felt the comfortable domesticity of the moment—the warmth, the feeling that he could say anything.
"What if—what if I plan a trip, and you come with me? Would you consider taking time off then?"
"You want to travel together?"
"I mean, I'm your assistant. Planning a vacation is practically administrative work."
"That's—I suppose that's reasonable."
"So you'd consider it?"
"I'd reluctantly agree. For your sake. Since you insist."
But Ian's tone was anything but reluctant. He sounded almost eager.
"November? After reporting season ends," Jay proposed.
"That works."
"I'll look for options. Maybe somewhere warm. And with good food."
"I trust your judgement."
They lay there for another moment, both smiling at the ceiling, surrounded by the wreckage of the afternoon. Jay felt absurdly happy. They had the botanical garden trip in spring. They had a vacation in November. So many things to look forward to.
Ian stood and stretched, surveying the now-organized stacks of gifts, and then looked at Jay.
"Stay for dinner. It's the least I can do after making you work all afternoon."
"You didn't make me—"
"Stay anyway."
Jay followed him to the kitchen and sat at the counter, watching Ian move around, chopping vegetables, heating oil, assembling ingredients. The food smelled amazing. Jay's mouth watered as Ian plated two servings and brought them to the table.
"This looks incredible," Jay said.
"Try it before you compliment it."
Jay took a bite. It was delicious.
"You're an amazing cook."
"I'm glad you like it."
It was late by the time Jay left, stepping out into the cool night air. He walked home, already thinking about where they might go in November. Somewhere they could both relax. Somewhere they could spend time together, just the two of them. The thought made him smile all the way home.
Scene 3
Smooth sailing
Jay spent all of Sunday browsing holiday options. He made lists, compared destinations, took notes on activities Ian might enjoy. Places with active ways to spend time—hiking, water sports, cultural sites. Preferably seaside, somewhere warm in November.
And only the absolute top hotels, places Ian would actually want to stay in. Jay looked at the prices and felt his stomach twist, but he pushed the feeling aside. It didn't matter if he had to bankrupt himself. He'd ensure Ian got the best possible experience.
By evening, he had a shortlist of possibilities and a notebook full of details.
Monday was hectic—the last day of September, everyone rushing to finish current tasks before the reporting season began. Jay stayed late, buried in assignments, and barely had time to talk to Ian beyond their morning briefing.
When he finally left at eight, Ian was still at his desk, surrounded by documents. They exchanged a look, Jay hesitating at the door, but there was nothing to say. The quarter was ending. This was normal.
Tuesday, the quarterly reports began.
Day one was preliminary—gathering data, downloading files, sorting through sources. Tedious, time-consuming work that kept everyone at their desks until late evening. Except this time, they finished by four.
Liv and Ray worked like an unstoppable machine. Ray especially—he tore through assignments like a robot, producing virtually flawless work at incredible speed. By the time Jay checked in at three, they were already tackling tasks scheduled for the next day.
Jay stared at his screen, disbelieving. "We're ahead of schedule."
"Way ahead," Luc confirmed, looking equally stunned.
Wednesday was supposed to be the worst day—assembling and reconciling countless rows of numbers, validating data, fixing errors, the boring, grinding work that kept them in the office until midnight. But by three in the afternoon, they were done, moving on to additional assignments with time to spare.
Rin made himself useful, running files between desks, double-checking calculations. Tia adapted quickly, following Rin's lead and staying out of the way when needed.
No overtime. No disasters. No one sleeping in the office.
Ian and Jay almost didn't know what to do with themselves. That evening, they organized tea in the lounge. The office was emptying out—people actually leaving at reasonable hours—and Ian and Jay sat at one of the small tables with cups of tea and Jay's laptop.
"This one has great hiking trails," Jay said, pointing at the screen. "And this one has historical sites nearby. Both are warm in November."
 "What about seaside?"
"All of them are coastal."
"Show me the hotels."
Jay clicked through options. Ian made suggestions, pointing out features he liked—private beaches, good restaurants, proximity to activities.
"This seems expensive," Jay said, hesitating over one particular resort.
"Cost doesn't matter. Leo pays, and you're going as my assistant to coordinate activities. It shouldn't even count as vacation."
Jay couldn't really argue with that. It had been his suggestion, after all. "Alright. I'll look at the top-tier options."
The reports continued their unprecedented smooth progress. Tasks that required weekend work were finished by Friday afternoon. Ray left each day at four, having bludgeoned through enormous portions of work, leaving everyone staring after him in disbelief.
Friday, Ian had an urgent regulatory matter that kept him late. Jay stayed until eight, helping where he could, but eventually had to leave Ian buried in legal documents he couldn't assist with.  At eight, Jay packed his things. He stopped by Ian's office.
"I'm heading out."
"Sorry about dinner."
"It's fine. You have work to do."
"This is going to take all weekend."
"I figured."
They looked at each other for a moment. Jay wanted to say something—hat he'd miss their dinner more than was reasonable—but he just said, "Good night."
"Good night, Jay."
Jay had expected this, prepared for it mentally, but it still left him feeling gloomy as he walked home alone.
Saturday, Jay went to the gym and tried to sweat out the misery. Rus noticed immediately.
"What's got you wound up?"
"Nothing. Just—work stuff."
"Work stuff that has you murdering the rowing machine?"
Jay stopped, breathing hard. "Fine. Your gift. What were you thinking? Take your assistant to the sauna? That's completely inappropriate."
Rus burst out laughing. "Oh my god. You're actually upset about that?"
"It's—it's weird! You can't just—"
"It's hilarious. You're pouting."
"I'm not pouting."
When Rus finally caught his breath, he wiped his eyes. "I'm glad work is less stressful, at least. Seems like Ian took my complaints to heart."
"It's the expanded staff. Liv and Ray are incredible. We're ahead of schedule for the first time ever."
"Good. You deserve a break."
Jay nodded, but the gloom lingered. Work was easier, but that didn't fix the disappointment of the missed Friday dinner.
The following week was equally easy. All emergencies were handled as they appeared, everything proceeding at express speed. The team even resumed their lunch outings—there was no reason not to, given they were on track to finish a day before deadline with no overtime whatsoever.
Jay didn't need to stay late either, but he did. Because evenings had become holiday planning time.
On Tuesday, they finalized the details. The Songbird Islands, first half of November. A royal suite in a cliff-side five-star hotel, with a view of the ocean and access to private beaches.
"This is it. Ten days. First half of November," Jay said. 
"Book it."
Jay pulled out the company card, looking at it like it might bite him. "Aren't we technically defrauding company funds?"
"Leo will survive. He spent millions on that ridiculous brooch. He can endure a couple thousand more for a decent hotel."
"This is more than a couple thousand."
"Book it, Jay."
Jay took a breath and entered the payment information. Ten days. Longer than he'd expected Ian to agree to.
They finished the reports on Wednesday. Everything triple-checked, quadruple-checked, every file polished to perfection. The team sat in stunned silence, looking at their completed work.
"We're done," Amy said, disbelieving.
"Actually done," Max confirmed.
Tia looked impressed. "Is it always like this?"
"No," Luc said immediately. "It's never like this. Normally we're all half-dead by now."
Thursday afternoon, Leo appeared in the office doorway, looking pleased with himself. He clapped his hands together, and the room went quiet.
"Attention, everyone. The promised hot springs trip will take place the last weekend of October. Three days, two nights, all expenses paid. Mark your calendars."
A cheer went through the office. Jay sat at his desk, frozen. His brain supplied an extremely vivid image of Ian in a bathrobe, and he nearly dropped his pen. The intrusive thought made him blush furiously. He ducked his head, pretending to organize papers, hoping no one noticed.
Thankfully, everyone was too busy celebrating to pay attention.
The quarterly party was on Friday. It was held at an elegant venue, perfectly beautiful and tastefully decorated, the atmosphere cheerful and low-stress. Rin and Tia didn't look nervous at all, seasoned now by Ian's birthday extravaganza. Ray was absent—clearly, whatever threats Leo had used before had lost their efficacy.
Jay kept drifting to Ian's side throughout the evening. They talked about work, about the upcoming hot-springs trip. It was comfortable, and yet—
Yet Jay felt the undercurrent of disappointment. The party was nice, but it was the second Friday dinner in a row that didn't happen, and that felt bad. And even though the circumstances were understandable, even though work had gone well, the absence of those evenings still left an ache.
They had so much to look forward to, so many plans, so many promises of time together, but right in this moment, Jay missed the feeling of having Ian's full attention.
Ian was talking to Amy when Jay approached, but he turned immediately.
"Enjoying yourself?" Ian asked.
"It's nice."
"But?"
"Nothing. It's a good party."
Jay had the uncomfortable sense that Ian could see straight through him, but Ian didn't press, just nodded and turned back to the conversation.
They saw each other every day, worked side by side, planned trips together, and yet Jay missed him desperately.
Scene 4
Lovesick
Saturday at the gym was miserable. Jay pushed himself, but his mood dragged behind him like a weight. Rus noticed immediately.
"Still mad about the gift?" Rus asked.
"What? No."
"Then what's wrong?"
"The car salesman is taking forever. Tim's birthday is next weekend and I still don't have the car."
"He'll come through."
"What if he doesn't?"
"He will."
Rus tried to engage him in conversation, but Jay gave monosyllabic answers until Rus finally left him alone.
The rest of the weekend was worse. Jay stayed home, flipping through television channels, scrolling through his phone. He told himself there was nothing wrong. Work was good. The vacation was booked. Everything was fine. The car will be ready on time.
But it didn't feel fine.
Jay was at his desk by eight on Monday, working through emails when his phone rang. The car salesman.
"Mr. Hall, I apologize for the delay, but I've found it. Are you available to come in this week?"
"Yes, absolutely. When?"
"Wednesday afternoon works for me. Say, five thirty?"
"Yes. Thank you."
He hung up and immediately went to Ian's office. 
"The salesman found a car. I'm meeting him Wednesday at five thirty."
"Good. I'll drive you."
 "You don't have to—"
"The reports are done. Workload is low. I don't need to stay late. Might as well confirm my recommended salesman did his job properly."
"Alright. Thank you."
Ian nodded, and Jay returned to his desk.
Wednesday at five, they left the office together. Ian drove them across the city to the dealership. The salesman met them at the entrance, shaking hands with Ian first and then Jay.
"Mr. Hagen, always a pleasure. And Mr. Hall, I think you'll be very pleased with what I found."
He led them to the lot. The car was unassuming, a dark blue sedan from a brand known for reliability and safety. Newer than Jay had hoped for and not too heavily used.
The salesman handed Jay a folder. "Full inspection paperwork. Service history. Everything's in order."
Jay opened the folder and stared at the pages. Technical specifications. Maintenance records. Numbers and terms he barely understood.
"I don't know much about cars," Jay admitted.
Ian took the folder from him and flipped through it. The salesman stood by, waiting. After a moment, Ian handed the folder back to Jay.
"Everything looks in order. It's a solid choice."
"You're sure?"
"The service history is clean and the price is fair. I'd recommend it."
Jay looked at the car again. It wasn't flashy or exciting, but it was reliable and safe.
"Alright. I'll take it."
The salesman smiled. "Excellent. Let's handle the paperwork."
They went inside, and Jay signed what felt like an endless stack of documents. Ian stood beside him, occasionally pointing out a clause or asking the salesman a clarifying question.
The salesman handed him the keys. "Congratulations, Mr. Hall. Drive safe."
They walked back out to the lot. Jay stood beside the car, keys in hand, feeling oddly uncertain.
"Thank you for coming with me," Jay said.
"It wasn't a problem. Drive safely. I'll see you tomorrow."
He walked to his own car, and Jay watched him go, disappointed. The whole thing had taken less than an hour. He'd wanted more time.
Jay got into the car and adjusted the seat, the mirrors, familiarizing himself with the controls. Then he started the engine and drove home. That evening, he called his mother.
"Jay! Did you find something?"
"Yes, I picked it up today. It's a good car. Tim will like it."
"Oh, thank goodness. I was starting to worry. You kept saying everything was fine, but—"
"Everything is fine. It just took longer than expected."
His mother sighed, relief evident in her voice. "You're a good brother, Jay. Tim's going to be so happy."
"I hope so."
She'd called several times over the past weeks, asking about progress. Jay had lied confidently each time, saying everything was proceeding smoothly, hoping the salesman wouldn't disappoint him. They talked for a few more minutes, confirming details for the weekend. Jay promised to arrive Friday evening. 
Jay packed Thursday evening, planning to leave straight from work to beat the traffic. He left at four on Friday, wanting to get a head start. Four hours to his hometown, longer if the Friday traffic was bad.
He stopped by Ian's office before leaving. 
"Heading out?"
"Yes. I'll see you Monday."
"Drive safely. And enjoy the weekend."
"Thank you."
They looked at each other for a long moment. Jay wanted to say something, but he didn't know what. A third Friday dinner lost.
"I'll see you Monday," Jay said again.
"Yes. Monday."
Jay left the office and walked to the parking garage. The custom they'd built felt fragile suddenly, like it was dissolving.
He got into the car and started the engine, pulling out into the Friday evening traffic. The drive ahead was long, but at least he had the car for Tim. He told himself things would get back to normal in November. After the hot springs trip. After the vacation. He just had to wait.
The drive out of the city was slow, traffic exactly as bad as he'd predicted. Jay gripped the steering wheel and tried to focus on the road, on anything except the persistent ache that had taken up residence in his chest. Four hours stretched ahead of him. Four hours to think about everything he was trying not to think about.
He'd never felt like this before. This hollow, aching wrongness. Like something essential was missing, even though objectively everything was fine. He saw Ian every day. They talked, they worked together, they had plans stretching months into the future. So why did it feel like he was starving?
The runs were postponed. The dinners no longer happened. Their morning briefings were short. The evenings planning trips in the office lounge had stopped once the reporting season ended. These little pieces that had given shape to his weeks were gone, and nothing had replaced them. Jay was miserable and didn't know how to cope with this.
He turned on the radio and drove.
Scene 5
Pining
Friday evening, Ian sat alone in his apartment with a glass of Jay's red-currant tincture.
He'd poured just a small amount, savouring the sweet warmth. It tasted like comfort. Like Jay's devotion poured into a tangible liquid. Ian set the glass down and told himself to behave.
This was ridiculous. He was a grown man, forty years old, sitting alone and pining like a teenager. Jay was gone for a weekend. Two days. That was nothing. Ian had spent years alone. He could certainly manage forty-eight hours.
Except it wasn't nothing. They saw each other constantly at work and somehow not at all.
It wasn't any easier for him than it was for Jay, though Jay probably didn't realize that. The missed Friday dinners felt like a loss, something slipping through his fingers that he didn't know how to hold onto. But he had things to look forward to. The hot-springs trip. The vacation in November.
Ian couldn't believe they actually had vacation plans. He couldn't remember the last time he'd taken a real vacation. A decade, maybe more. He'd never thought much about it before. Work had always been enough. But now—now the perspective of that trip was what held him together. Knowing that in a few weeks, he'd have Jay's undivided attention again.
Jay arrived late Friday night, parking the car at the neighbour's house and sneaking into his mother's home like a conspirator. He'd barely closed the door when footsteps thundered down the stairs.
"Jay!"
Ema reached him first, throwing her arms around him. Ari appeared next, and even Tim came down, trying to look casual but clearly excited.
"You made it," Tim said.
"Of course I made it. It's your birthday."
His mother appeared in the hallway. "Come in, come in. Are you hungry? I saved dinner."
"I'm fine. I ate on the way."
"Tea, then. Sit down, tell us about the drive."
Jay let himself be pulled into the warmth of the house, surrounded by voices and the comfort of family.
Saturday afternoon, Tim's birthday party took place in a small local venue with worn floors, a place that hosted birthday parties, anniversary dinners, and graduation celebrations for families that couldn't afford anything fancier. It was cramped, decorated with streamers and balloons, tables crowded together.
Family and friends filled the space with noise. Uncles Jay rarely saw, cousins he didn't recognize, Tim's closest classmates. Ari played with younger children in the corner. Ema had brought Lam, the two of them inseparable these days. Instead of the glamorous Victorian gowns from Ian's gala, they wore simple dresses. They still talked about the ball though, Jay overheard them reminiscing about the orchestra and the fireworks.
The food was adequate. Typical small-town venue dishes, heavy on volume to compensate for any lack of sophistication. Casseroles and roasted vegetables and platters of meat. The cake was big enough to feed everyone twice over, decorated with blue frosting. Music played from a loudspeaker in the corner, slightly too loud and slightly distorted.
Jay found a seat near the back and watched the room. His stepfather's side of the family was here in force, cousins and aunts and uncles who had never been particularly warm toward him. His mother's side was smaller, mostly older relatives who remembered him as a child.
He'd always found these gatherings awkward. The sense of being an outsider in his own family, tolerated but not quite belonging. But today, he discovered he didn't care as much anymore. He had his own life now. This was just one part of it, not the whole.
This was the opposite of Ian's gala. Shabby around the edges, messy, imperfect, nothing elegant about it. But it was full of love.
Jay was reminded that he came from humble beginnings. This was his world—simple, warm, unpretentious. He didn't need to perform here or worry about wearing the right clothes.
When the time came for the big reveal, Jay's mother called for everyone's attention. Tim stood in the centre of the room, looking confused.
"What's going on?"
Jay pulled the car keys from his pocket. "Happy birthday."
"What?"
"Come outside."
The whole party followed them out to the parking lot, where the blue sedan was waiting. Tim stopped dead, his mouth falling open.
"Is that—"
"It's yours. Happy eighteenth."
Tim made a sound that was half-laugh, half-shout, and threw his arms around Jay. "Are you serious? This is mine?"
"Yes."
"Oh my god. Oh my god." Tim pulled back and ran to the car, circling it like he couldn't believe it was real. "This is insane. Jay, this is—I can't—"
Tim got into the driver's seat and immediately started adjusting everything, his hands shaking with excitement. Jay's stepfather came over and clapped Jay on the shoulder, the first real acknowledgement he'd given him all day.
"It's a good thing you did."
Jay nodded and watched. His mother was crying. Ema was filming the whole thing on her phone.
Later, when people were starting to leave, Jay found Ema sitting outside on the venue's small patio. Jay sat down beside her. "I wanted to ask you something."
"Sure."
"The botanical garden tickets. For Ian's birthday. Why did you choose that?"
"Leo helped me pick it. He said Ian would definitely love a change of scenery."
Of course. Of course it was Leo's scheme. Everything always was. But he wasn't really mad anymore. If anything, he was pleased. They had something to look forward to in spring. A whole weekend away from the city, just the two of them.
"Did he tell you anything else?"
"Just that Ian never goes anywhere fun, and you'd probably enjoy showing him around your old city. Was it okay? I wasn't sure if it was too personal."
"No, it was a good choice. He's excited about it."
"Good. I'm glad."
"Thanks, Ema," Jay said.
She bumped her shoulder against his. "Anytime."
Sunday afternoon, Jay took the train back to the city. He hadn't traveled by train in years, not since he'd started working with Ian. Before that, trains had been his primary method of getting anywhere. The process felt nostalgic if slightly uncomfortable, requiring him to change trains twice, first in the nearby city, then in a bigger hub along the way. Each transfer meant waiting on platforms, watching the crowds, hauling his bag from one train to another. It was tedious, much longer than driving would have been, but he'd left the car with Tim.
He sat by the window and watched small towns give way to suburbs, then to the outskirts of the city. By the time he reached his stop, evening was falling. He took a taxi to his building, and when he reached his apartment, he pulled out his phone and sent a text to Ian. "Everything went great. Home safe."
Ian's reply came within minutes: "I'm glad. Get some rest. See you tomorrow."
Ian read Jay's text and set his phone down on the coffee table. Home safe. Good. He opened the wooden box again and poured another small measure of the red currant tincture. Just a small amount, like medicine. Medicine for pining. 
Chapter 45: Steam and stars
Scene 1
Salt-ocean smell
The autumn air cut through Jay's coat as he stepped out of the metro station Monday morning. The chill was welcome, sharp enough to clear his head. He walked to Northlight Financial Center with his heart doing somersaults in his chest. He'd been gone two days, and he felt ridiculous about how much he wanted to see Ian again.
Jay arrived early, but he didn't go straight to his desk. Instead he walked to the window and looked down at the street below, scanning the morning traffic for Ian's car. He stayed there, watching, aware he was being absurd but unable to help himself.
A silver car turned the corner.
Jay straightened. The car pulled into the underground parking entrance and disappeared from view. He counted the time it would take to park, walk to the elevator, ride up. His pulse quickened.
Ian walked in, and their eyes met. They both smiled, each trying to conceal the relief of seeing the other, but the joy was impossible to mask despite their best attempts.
"Good morning," Ian said, crossing the space between them.
"Morning," Jay replied, trying to sound casual and failing completely.
"How was the trip?"
"Tiring, but good. Tim loved the car. The party was fun. The train ride home was long. I slept most of it."
"You should have taken an extra day to rest."
"No. I mean, I wanted to be back. For work. To prepare for the hot springs trip."
They stood there, both smiling like idiots, until Amy's arrival broke the spell. Then Ian moved toward his office, and Jay turned to his computer.
“A bit early,” she said, setting down her bag. “Wanted to get ahead of everything.”
Jay nodded. “Yeah, good call.”
Soon everyone was hard at work preparing for the upcoming trip. The departure was planned for Friday morning, which meant the team wanted to ensure no backlog would greet them when they returned. Tasks were completed efficiently, everything put in order.
No one worried about falling behind. The atmosphere was light, energized by anticipation. Everyone looked forward to the weekend.
Wednesday afternoon, Jay left went shopping. Warm sweaters, gloves, thick socks. He bought a fluffy hat with earflaps that made him look slightly ridiculous but would definitely keep him warm.
Thursday evening he packed, laying everything out on his bed first. Casual clothes, resort-appropriate items, a suit just in case something formal came up. The warm sweaters went in first, then everything else. He was done in half an hour, no longer agonizing over every choice. Whatever he brought would be adequate.
Friday morning, Ian picked him up after breakfast. Jay waited outside his building, watching Ian's car pull up to the curb.
"Ready?" Ian asked as Jay climbed in.
"Ready."
They drove straight to the airport, arriving to find most of the team already gathering near the departure terminal. Luc was talking animatedly to Rin. Ela and Kim stood together near the entrance. Zoe and Amy were checking their tickets.
Then Ray appeared, and everyone stopped talking. He stood there with a large backpack, surveying the terminal. 
Luc recovered first. "Ray. You're coming?"
"Yes." 
"But you never—you don't do company trips." 
"I love hot springs," Ray said laconically.
The words were delivered so flatly that Jay couldn't tell if he was serious. Apparently no one else could either, judging by the shocked looks being exchanged. Ray loved hot springs? Or had Leo threatened him again?
The flight to Ashland took two hours. Boarding and disembarking took longer than the flight itself—the shuffle of luggage, passengers, security checks. 
Jay sat by the window, watching the landscape beneath them. Ian sat beside him, reading something on his tablet. Every so often Jay would glance over. Ian would look back, smile slightly, and return to his reading.
The plane descended smoothly. They landed with barely a bump, and then everyone was gathering bags and filing out into the terminal into air so fresh and cold it stung. Jay tugged on his new hat immediately.
"Nice hat," Ian said.
"It's warm."
"It has earflaps."
"I know what it has."
Ian's mouth twitched, but he didn't say anything else.
A bus waited outside the airport to transport them to their accommodations. The drive took forty minutes along winding coastal roads, the ocean visible through breaks in the rocky landscape. The air smelled like salt and stone.
Finally, the resort appeared, a sprawling modern structure of glass and wood built into the cliff side. It was small, visibly exclusive, with only a few other guests walking the grounds. Everything looked pristine and sophisticated. The ocean roared below. The wind was fierce here, whipping hair and coats as they climbed out. 
A hostess greeted them in the lobby.
"Welcome to Frostbay Sanctuary. You'll be staying in our two-person suites, each with a private balcony and ocean view. Mr. Turner has arranged everything. If you'll follow me, I'll show you to your rooms, and then we'll go over the facilities and schedule."
She distributed key cards—Rin with Ray, which made Rin's face light up with barely contained joy. Luc with Max. Liv with Tia. Ela and Kim together as usual. Zoe with Amy. And Ian with Jay.
No one complained about the arrangements. The resort was incredibly beautiful, everything fresh and meticulously maintained, the air carrying that persistent salt-ocean smell that made everything feel clean.
They were shown to their rooms—spacious, modern, with minimalist furniture and stone accents. The bathroom featured a high-tech spa tub with more settings than Jay could immediately parse.
After lunch in the resort's dining room—fresh seafood and local produce prepared simply—they changed into swimsuits in their suite, wrapping themselves in the enormous white bathrobes provided by the resort. They headed down to the pool area, following the signs toward the largest soaking pool. The hostess met them there and launched into an explanation of the facility.
"The water is rich in minerals and very good for the skin, though I recommend keeping your hair dry if possible. The clay at the bottom has excellent health benefits. Feel free to apply it anywhere. The pools are quite warm, around forty degrees, so take breaks if you need them. Otherwise, just relax and enjoy."
The pool stretched out before them, its water an impossible turquoise blue. Steam rose from the surface in wisps, dissipating into the cold air. Several smaller pools dotted the area, and further down the cliff Jay could see another pool directly adjacent to the ocean, waves crashing just meters away.
They shed their robes quickly and entered the water to escape the chill. The heat was immediate and intense, sinking into muscles and bones. 
Ray was already in the main pool, stationed in a corner with a contented expression, enthusiastically smearing clay across his arms.
Rin appeared beside Jay, watching Ray with delight. "Did you see? He's actually smiling."
"I don't think that's a smile," Jay said.
"It's close enough."
Rin positioned himself near Ray, copying his clay application with exaggerated movements. Ray glanced at him but said nothing, which Rin apparently took as permission to continue.
Luc floated around the pool, completely disregarding the fact that he was supposed to mind his hair, which was getting progressively wetter and more disheveled.
Jay splashed around for a few minutes, feeling the hot water immediately relax muscles that had been unnaturally tense lately—though he hadn't quite realized how tense until until the warmth began to undo it. The heat worked its way through his shoulders, his back, his legs. 
Finally, he found a spot near Ian, who had chosen a stone seat along the pool's side. Jay sank down beside him, the water deep enough to cover their shoulders. It felt blissful.
They reclined against the smooth stone, the water lapping gently around them, steam rising into the cold air above. Ian's eyes were closed, his expression peaceful.
The heat melted away everything—the missed Friday dinners, the stress of the quarter, the constant low-level anxiety. Here, in the steaming water with the cold air on his face and Ian beside him, none of it mattered. He could stay like this for hours.


Scene 2
Aurora
They soaked for about two hours, taking short breaks to step out into the chilly air for water and to cool down before plunging back into the heat. The heat worked its way deep into Jay's bones, leaving him loose and heavy in the best way. Around him, the team had spread out across the pool, some chatting, others floating in silence.
Eventually Ela climbed out, wrapping herself in her robe. "I think I'm done. Any more and I'll melt completely."
"Agreed," Amy said, following her.
One by one they extracted themselves from the water. Jay felt boneless as he wrapped himself in his robe, the cold air shocking after the pool's heat.
"We should walk before dinner. The views are supposed to be incredible," Zoe said.
"It's freezing," Kim pointed out.
"That's what coats are for."
They returned to their rooms to bundle up properly. Jay layered his warmest sweater under his coat, added his new scarf and gloves, and headed down the path toward the ocean. The wind was cutting through layers, but the landscape was worth it. The sun had already set, leaving the sky a deep indigo streaked with the last traces of orange. Stars were beginning to appear overhead, brighter than they ever were in the city. The horizon stretched endlessly, the island's cliffs rising dark and dramatic against the fading light.
Zoe was excited. "We have to hike tomorrow. Look at this terrain—there are trails everywhere."
"In this cold?" Ela asked, pulling her coat tighter.
"It's great hiking weather. Cold but not too cold. We'll warm up once we start moving."
"I'm in," Luc said immediately.
Ray, walking a few paces behind, spoke up. "There's a route that passes several natural hot springs at the base of the cliffs."
"We're doing that one," Zoe agreed.
They walked for another twenty minutes, boots crunching on stones, until the cold became uncomfortable, then retreated toward the warmth of the main building. Jay's face felt frozen, his fingers numb, but he was smiling.
Dinner was served in a room with a massive fireplace crackling at one end. The table was low to the ground, surrounded by plush pillows instead of chairs. They sat awkwardly at first, trying to find comfortable positions, but the informality suited the mood. Everyone was in casual clothes, even Ian wearing a loose cream sweater.
The food was hearty—thick stews with root vegetables and tender meat, herbal breads still warm from the oven, salads with sharp vinaigrette, small dishes of pickled vegetables and creamy butter. Jay took a piece of bread, dunked it into the stew, bit down and immediately sighed deeply in appreciation. 
"This is incredible."
"It's good," Ian agreed.
Jay wasn't interested in restraint. He sprawled gracelessly on the floor cushion, no longer caring about presentation, and devoted himself entirely to the food. The bread was great for soaking up every drop of stew, and he stuffed his mouth full without apology. Between bites he kept declaring, "This is heaven. Actually heaven."
Ian sat properly upright beside him, watching Jay eat with undisguised fondness. Jay was too absorbed in his dinner to notice, making happy noises over the food. It was unbelievably endearing.
Around them, the team had fallen into their own conversations. Rin was making a valiant attempt to engage Ray, asking about different hot spring minerals and water temperatures. Surprisingly, Ray kept responding, commenting about the pools and tomorrow's planned activities.
"The wild pools have different mineral content than the resort ones. More sulphur."
"Oh, that's interesting. "Do you soak often? Back home, I mean?"
"Sometimes."
It was like watching someone try to befriend a particularly taciturn cat, Jay thought. But Ray seemed more open, perhaps mellowed by hours in hot water.
Tia sat between Luc and Max, all three of them drinking ice-cold vodka from small glasses. Ela watched them with disapproval.
"You're going to regret that tomorrow," she said.
"That's tomorrow's problem," Max replied cheerfully, pouring another round.
Kim laughed. "Let them suffer. It'll be entertaining."
Zoe had her phone out, map pulled up, tracing routes with one finger. "If we leave early we can hit three viewpoints before lunch. The second one overlooks the cliffs on the eastern side."
At the far end of the table, Amy and Liv were discussing something work-related. Max caught wind of it and called out, "No work talk! We're supposed to relax and forget about the office."
Amy waved him off. "We're just talking about process improvements."
"That's still work!"
Jay laughed, taking another piece of bread. "This is amazing. I never want to leave."
Ian smiled at that, sitting straight-backed while Jay sprawled beside him like a contented cat. "You're going to make yourself sick."
"Worth it."
As full darkness fell, the hostess appeared at the door. "If you're interested, the aurora is visible tonight. We have a viewing pool at the ocean's edge—it's a bit of a walk, but the perspective is spectacular."
Everyone agreed immediately and hurried to their rooms to grab bathrobes and towels. Luc and Max were noticeably unsteady, the vodka having done its work, but they insisted they were fine.
"I'm not missing the aurora because I had a few drinks," Luc declared, swaying slightly.
Ray led the group down the lantern-lit path toward the ocean, moving with surprising confidence through the dark. The temperature had dropped further, the wind bitter and unrelenting. Jay huddled into his robe, walking quickly to keep warm.
The pool appeared at the edge of a rocky outcrop, steam rising dramatically into the cold air. It was darker than the main pool, the water appearing almost black in the dim light, and it sat directly adjacent to the ocean. Waves crashed just meters away, spray occasionally misting over the rocks.
They shed their robes and practically dove into the water, gasping with relief as the heat enveloped them. The pool was deep, the bottom smooth stone, the water almost too hot, borderline painful, but after the freezing air it felt incredible.
Above them the aurora unfurled. Green light rippled across the sky in waves, brightening and fading, joined by threads of purple and blue. It moved like it was alive, shimmering and folding. The stars were everywhere, brilliant in the absence of city light.
The pool's lighting was minimal, designed not to interfere with the view, revealing just enough to show the spectacular setting—hot spring water meeting the edge of the ocean.
"Holy shit," Luc whispered.
Jay couldn't speak. He tilted his head back and watched the lights dance. The ocean roared beside them, cold spray drifting over the edge of the pool. He drifted toward the ocean, drawn by the juxtaposition, and reached out experimentally, extending one hand toward the seawater. The cold hit like a shock and he yanked his hand back with a yelp.
Ian chuckled. "What did you expect?"
"I don't know. Not that."
The contrast was absurd. The water they sat in was blisteringly hot, while inches away the ocean was near freezing. The two existed side by side, separated by a thin wall of stone. Above them the aurora continued its display, colours bleeding across the sky. The stars gleamed between the curtains of light. Jay could hear the ocean, smell the salt, feel the steam on his face and the heat surrounding his body. This was the most beautiful thing he'd ever witnessed. Nothing else came close.
They stayed for an hour, watching the lights fade and intensify, fade and intensify. Eventually the hostess returned, reminding them not to overdo it. They climbed out reluctantly, wrapping themselves in the robes and hurrying back up the path. The wind was worse now, vicious and unrelenting. Jay's hair was still wet and the cold made his scalp ache.
Back in their suite, Ian disappeared into the bathroom first, showering quickly. Jay waited his turn, then eyed the enormous spa bath tucked in the corner.
"I'm taking a bath," he announced.
"Don't fall asleep in there."
Jay filled the huge tub, dumping in bath salts until the water turned milky. He climbed in and sank down with a groan. The tub had jets and he turned them all on, fiddling with the settings until the water churned around him. It was absurd. He had a bath at home now, used it regularly, but this was different. The jets pulsed against his back and he grinned stupidly at nothing.
When he finally emerged, wrapped in the resort's plush robe, Ian had opened a bottle of local wine and was reading in one of the chairs by the window.
"There's a glass for you," Ian said, gesturing to the nightstand.
Jay grabbed the wine and collapsed onto his bed, sprawling across the covers without bothering to arrange himself properly. The wine was crisp and cold, perfectly complementing the lingering heat in his muscles from the bath.
"This place is incredible," he announced to the ceiling. 
"Leo has excellent taste when he applies himself," Ian replied.
"The aurora was unreal. Did you see how bright it got near the end? And those colours. The pools are amazing. The food is amazing. The air smells amazing. Even the cold is great."
"You're very enthusiastic tonight."
"I don't think I've been this relaxed in my life."
"I'm glad."
They talked about the wind and the food. Jay's words came slower, his sentences trailing off. The wine and the heat and the long day made eyelids heavy, the comfort of the bed pulling him down. He didn't notice when he fell asleep. One moment he was talking, the next he was gone, glass still half full on the floor beside the bed.
Ian retrieved a blanket from the closet and draped it over him. Jay didn't stir. Ian stood there for a moment, watching him. 
When was the last time Ian had felt this happy? He couldn't remember. Maybe never. Certainly not in recent years. Watching Jay sleep, knowing they had an entire weekend ahead in this beautiful place, filled him with bliss. Not the fleeting kind that came and went, but a bone-deep contentment.
Scene 3
Very interesting wood
Breakfast was lively, Zoe dominating the conversation with her phone in hand, swiping through trail maps and photos of dramatic cliff formations.
"This route goes along the eastern ridge. Incredible views, and there's a natural arch about three kilometres in."
"What about this one? It passes four wild springs," Ray asked, pointing to a different path.
"But the views aren't as good."
"The springs are better."
"We could combine them. Take the ridge path to the arch, then loop back through the spring valley. If we leave now and pack food."
"I'm coming with you," Rin said.
"Me too," Luc said, shoveling eggs into his mouth.
Max shook his head. "Too ambitious for me. I'll take the easy route."
"Same. I'm here to relax, not march through the wilderness," Kim agreed. 
Jay focused on his breakfast, already dreading the cold. The dining room was warm, but he could see the frost on the windows. The weather had dropped even further overnight.
After breakfast they all returned to their rooms to prepare. Jay layered his warmest sweater under his winter coat, added his scarf and fluffy hat and gloves. He decided this should be adequate. The coat had served him well through city winters.
They gathered in the lobby, and Jay immediately felt under-dressed. Zoe wore what looked like mountaineering gear, with technical fabrics and insulated layers. Ray's jacket was similar, designed for serious cold. Even Luc had a proper winter hiking coat, thick and wind-resistant.
"Everyone ready?" Zoe asked.
They stepped outside into air so cold it hurt to breathe. Jay's eyes watered immediately. He pulled his scarf tighter and told himself it would be fine once they started moving.
The trail began gently, leading away from the resort along the cliff edge. The wind was relentless, whipping across the exposed landscape with nothing to stop it. Jay's teeth started chattering within the first ten minutes. His coat was clearly insufficient for this harsh northern weather. He eyed his coworkers' technical jackets with growing distrust of his own choices.
At the first junction, Zoe outlined the plan. "Ray, Rin, Luc and I are taking the longer route to the springs. The rest of you can take this path up the hill—shorter, but the view from the top is supposed to be beautiful."
"Sounds good," Amy agreed.
The groups split, Zoe's team heading off while the rest began the ascent up the smaller hill. The climb wasn't difficult, but the cold was brutal. Jay focused on putting one foot in front of the other, trying to ignore how much he was shaking.
"You okay?" Ian appeared beside him, looking annoyingly comfortable in a sleek dark jacket.
"Fine," Jay managed through chattering teeth.
Ten minutes later, Ian checked again. "Jay?"
"I'm fine."
"Jay, you're turning blue."
"Just cold. It's fine."
Another ten minutes passed. Jay's nose was running and he couldn't feel his toes. Ian stopped walking and turned to face him.
"We're going back."
"What? No. I can keep going."
"You're about to drop dead from hypothermia. We're returning to the resort."
"Ian, I'm fine, really—"
"Jay."
Jay wanted to protest further, but honestly he was miserable. The cold had worked its way deep into his bones, and he couldn't feel his fingers anymore.
"Okay," he admitted.
Ian called ahead to Amy. "We're heading back. Jay's too cold."
"See you at lunch," Amy shouted back.
The walk back seemed longer than the walk out. Jay concentrated on moving, keeping his arms wrapped around himself for whatever warmth he could generate. Ian stayed close beside him. When they finally reached the resort, Jay practically fell through the door.
"Come on," Ian said, steering him toward their suite.
In their room, Jay collapsed into a chair and pulled off his gloves with numb fingers. "I don't understand. Why wasn't anyone else bothered by the freezing cold?"
"Because we wore appropriate gear."
"I was wearing my warmest sweater."
Ian was pulling off his jacket. Underneath he wore a regular sweater, but when he lifted it slightly Jay saw another layer beneath. "Thermal underwear. You need base layers for this kind of weather."
Jay stared at the garment. "Thermal underwear?"
"Yes. You wear it under your regular clothes. It traps body heat."
Of course Ian had known about proper gear. Ian probably owned an entire collection of technical clothing for every conceivable weather condition.
"I didn't know that existed. I thought the sweater would be enough. Next time, tell me I need thermal underwear before I almost die."
"I assumed you knew."
"Why would I know? I'm from a small town in the south. We don't have extreme weather."
"Noted. Next time, I'll provide a full equipment list. Hot spring?"
"Yes. Please. Immediately."
They changed and made their way down to the pool area, this time choosing one of the smaller, secluded pools tucked away from the main complex. Jay descended into the hot water with a groan, the heat immediately working on his frozen muscles.
"This is better. This is so much better."
The pool was peaceful, the sound of waves distant. Jay felt his body slowly returning to normal, warmth replacing the bone-deep chill. By the time they returned to the main building for lunch, Jay had recovered completely. The rest of the team was already there, eating and chatting. Jay slid into his seat and immediately launched into his complaints.
"No one told me I needed thermal underwear. I didn't even know that was a thing people wore."
Kim laughed. "You went hiking in arctic wind without base layers?"
"I had my warmest sweater."
"Oh, Jay. You poor thing," Ela shook her head.
"I even brought heating pads, but I still wouldn't hike as far as Zoe's platoon," Kim added.
Tia agreed. "I had enough discomfort during my military years. I much prefer the pampering activities now. You won't catch me freezing on a mountain."
"Smart," Jay muttered into his soup.
After lunch people split off to explore the resort. Liv, Amy, Ela, and Tia went to book spa treatments. Max and Kim discovered a pool table in a rec room and disappeared immediately.
Ian looked at Jay. "Want to explore?"
"Sure."
They wandered through the resort, discovering various amenities. A library, a meditation room, several smaller pools in addition to the main ones. Eventually they found a terrace overlooking the ocean, equipped with gas outdoor heaters and thick blankets arranged on oversized armchairs.
"This is great," Jay said, claiming a chair near one of the heaters.
Staff appeared with a pot of hot spicy tea and big ceramic cups. Jay wrapped both hands around his cup and pulled a blanket over his legs.
The sun hung low in the sky, beginning its slow descent toward the horizon. The volcanic rocks below were dark and alien-looking, water crashing against them endlessly. The salt smell was strong here, carried on the wind that no longer felt quite so hostile thanks to the heaters.
They watched the light change, the sky turning from pale blue to pink at the edges. The ocean reflected the colours, turning gold where the sun touched it. Jay had seen sunsets before, but this place made it feel different, more vivid.
They stayed on the terrace until the light began to fade. The temperature dropped with the sun, but the heaters and blankets kept them comfortable. Jay felt utterly content, the disasters of the morning hike forgotten in the warmth and beauty of the afternoon.
The adventurous group returned shortly before dinner, shaking from the cold, red-faced and grinning. Even Ray looked accomplished, which was remarkable.
"That was incredible. The most beautiful ridge view I've ever seen.," Zoe announced.
"It was freezing," Luc added.
"We need sauna. Immediately. Before dinner. Nothing heats better than sauna. We need to unfreeze our cores," Ray said.
Everyone stopped and stared. Ray barely spoke, but here he was, actively demanding sauna time, looking almost animated about it.
"Sauna it is," Max agreed, clearly not wanting to miss this unprecedented moment.
The first time Ray had shown enthusiasm for anything social, no one was going to refuse. The group reconvened, everyone heading to their rooms to prepare. Jay walked beside Ian, feeling his stomach start to tie itself in knots.
"The sauna is communal?" he asked.
"Yes."
"And. Traditional. In the northern style."
"Naked, yes."
Sauna culture wasn't big in Jay's hometown. He knew it was popular in the north, he'd just never actually done it. Sitting naked next to coworkers seemed like a big ask. Sitting naked next to Ian seemed impossible.
In their room, he changed into a robe, trying to think of an excuse to skip it. A year ago, this would have paralysed him. The anxiety would have won, hands down. But now? His insecurities were still there, still whispering, but this was socially acceptable time with Ian naked. When else would this opportunity present itself? The excitement of the moment overtook every other consideration. The shame, the fear—they were irrelevant in the face of that.
He followed Ian down to the sauna complex. The facility was beautiful, with multiple rooms at different temperatures. They gathered in the changing area, everyone stripping off robes and wrapping towels around their waists for the walk to the hot room.
The sauna itself was large enough to accommodate their group comfortably. Ray had chosen the hottest one, the temperature gauge reading ninety degrees. Jay could feel the heat radiating out even before they entered.
Inside, wooden benches lined the walls in tiers. Everyone claimed spots, and then the towels came off. Jay kept his eyes straight as he removed his own towel and sat down on the second tier, trying to look like this was completely normal and not at all terrifying.
Thankfully the heat of the place hid his crimson blush well.
He stared determinedly at the ceiling. The wood was beautiful, expertly fitted. Very interesting wood. Fascinating wood, really.
From the corner of his eye, he could see Ian sitting nearby. Completely naked. Casually reclining against the wall like this was the most natural thing in the world. Ian looked relaxed, elegant, completely unbothered. Beautiful.
Jay's eyes darted over before he could stop himself. Ian's body was perfectly sculpted, lean muscle definition from years of training. The gym had done its work. He looked like he belonged in marble.
Jay snapped his eyes back to the ceiling. This was mortifying. 
This was also thrilling, making him feel guilty and excited and terrified all at once. Ian's body, completely exposed to his eyes, made his heart hammer so loudly he was certain everyone could hear it. The heat made it worse, his pulse racing, his skin flushed. This view was going to haunt his dreams for the rest of his life.
"This is exactly what we needed," Ray broke the silence.
"Agreed. I can feel my core temperature coming back," Zoe replied.
Jay focused on their voices, trying to distract himself. This was normal. People did this all the time. He wasn't dying, even though it felt like he might be.
"How hot does this get?" Rin asked.
"Up to a hundred degrees. But ninety is optimal for recovery."
The conversation continued, but Jay contributed nothing, too busy trying not to stare at Ian while also trying not to make it obvious that he was trying not to stare.
"You alright?" Ian asked at one point.
"Fine. Just hot."
"That's the point."
"Right. Yes. The point."
Jay returned his attention to the ceiling, where it would stay for the foreseeable future, and tried to remember how to breathe normally.
Scene 4
Pitiful plea
After the sauna, dinner was a natural conclusion to an exhausting day. The food was hearty and filling—roasted pheasants with root vegetables, thick gravy, more of that wonderful herbal bread.
Rin was recounting their trail adventures. "And then Ray—Ray—just stripped down and plunged straight into this wild pond. No hesitation. Just dove right in."
Luc nodded along. "I thought he was joking. He was not joking."
"He went under completely. I've never seen him look that happy," Zoe added.
Ray looked completely unperturbed by the storytelling. "Wild pools are even better than the facility ones. More minerals, less processing."
"It smelled like sulphur," Rin complained.
"That's the minerals."
"It was awful. Like rotten eggs."
Ray just shrugged and returned to his food.
Rin laughed again, clearly delighted by the entire experience. The team smiled, enjoying the unusual glimpse into Ray's passions.
Jay picked at his pheasant, only half-listening. The sauna had left him feeling strange. He kept seeing it. Ian's body, completely bare, enchanting and irresistible. The image refused to leave. Every time he closed his eyes it was there, burned into his mind. He needed to stop thinking about it.
He reached for his wine glass and drank more than he meant to. When no one was looking he found a bottle of liquor on the side table and poured a generous measure into his glass. The alcohol hit him faster than expected, the sauna apparently having destroyed what little tolerance he had. His limbs started to feel heavy.
By the middle of dinner, everything had gone blurry. Jay stared at his half-eaten pheasant and tried to remember why he'd stopped eating it. He wanted to eat more, but the fork was difficult to manage.
Ian turned to look at him. "Jay?"
"Mmm?"
"Are you alright?"
"Fiiiine."
"How much did you drink?"
"Little bit. Maybe. More than little bit."
"I think we should step outside for some air."
"'M fine."
"You're not fine. Come on."
Jay didn't answer. He was focused on his plate, trying to spear a piece of potato. Ian got up and addressed the table. "We're heading back. He needs to sleep this off."
"This is becoming a tradition," Luc observed.
"Seems like it."
Max raised his glass in a mock salute. "Good luck."
Ian helped him stand. Jay's legs worked, but only just. Everything tilted sideways. He held onto Ian's arm and concentrated on walking.
They made it to the lobby before Ian paused. "Let's get some fresh air. It might help."
He guided Jay toward the entrance, and they stepped outside into the freezing night. The cold was shocking after the warmth of the dining room. Above them, stars scattered across the sky in impossible numbers, burning fiercely against the darkness.
"Oh," Jay breathed, staring up. Then the cold registered fully and he whimpered, pressing against Ian. "Cold. It's so cold."
He clung to Ian desperately, trying to burrow into his warmth. The embrace was clumsy, but he didn't care. Ian was warm and Jay was freezing. Ian's arms came around him. For a moment they stood like that, Jay plastered against Ian's chest, shivering. Ian seemed torn, his hold uncertain, like he couldn't decide whether to push Jay away or pull him closer.
"We need to get you inside," Ian said finally. 
He steered Jay back through the lobby and down the hallway to their suite. Jay stumbled along beside him, still holding onto Ian's sleeve with both hands.
In the room, Ian tried to guide him toward the bed. "Come on. You need to sleep this off."
But Jay pulled back, refusing. He sat down on the floor instead and stayed there, looking up at Ian with unfocused eyes.
"Jay, get up."
"No."
"You can't sleep on the floor."
"Don't wanna."
Ian crouched beside him, looking concerned. "What's wrong? Tell me what I can do to help."
"Nothing. There's nothing you can do."
"That's not true. I'll do anything. Just tell me what you want."
"I want you to hold me for the rest of my life," Jay whispered.
Ian froze.
Jay looked at him through the fog of alcohol, seeing Ian's expression, and felt his heart crack. "It's okay. I know it's too much. I know. Just—just for tonight? Please? Just tonight and I won't ask again, I promise."
His vision was blurring. He might have been crying, he wasn't sure, and Ian was looking at him like Jay had said something incomprehensible.
"Please," Jay whispered. "Just tonight."
"Alright. Alright, I've got you."
Ian cursed himself as he gathered Jay into his arms, moving him to the bed. He lay down with Jay still clinging to him, arranging them both on top of the covers, Jay's head tucked against his shoulder.
"There. I'm holding you. Is this what you wanted?"
"Yeah. This is—this is amazing. Don't need anything else. Ever."
Jay made himself comfortable against Ian's body, fitting himself into the spaces between them. Ian's arms were tight around him. This was more than he'd ever dared hope for.
"This is amazing. Feels so good. Don't need anything else. Just this. Just you."
Ian's hold tightened. "Shh. Just rest."
Jay felt Ian's hand come up to stroke through his hair. The motion was soothing, hypnotic. Jay's eyes drifted closed. The alcohol and exhaustion and warmth all combined, pulling him down into sleep.
Ian held him for a long time after Jay's breathing evened out into sleep. He lay there in the dark room, arms around Jay, feeling the rise and fall of his chest. Jay had curled into him trustingly, completely relaxed now.
Hold me for the rest of my life.
The words echoed in Ian's head, playing on repeat. He knew it was just drunk rambling, likely triggered by the atmosphere, the exhaustion, the wine on top of the sauna. It didn't mean anything. Jay wouldn't even remember saying it tomorrow.
It was still the most beautiful thing Ian had ever heard.
He wanted to kiss Jay's hair. The temptation was almost painful. Just a small gesture, barely anything. But he couldn't. He had already crossed too many lines tonight, if he took more it would become something he couldn't take back.
He stayed like that for what felt like hours, savouring the weight of Jay against him, the warmth of his body, the sounds of his breathing. This moment, this closeness—it was something Ian would never forget, even knowing he shouldn't have it.
Finally, when he was certain Jay was deeply asleep, Ian extracted himself. He laid Jay down properly, wrapped him in a blanket, made sure he was comfortable and warm, then he forced himself to move away. He went to his own bed and lay down, staring at the ceiling in the darkness.
Sleep was impossible. His mind kept replaying the evening—Jay clinging to him in the cold, the desperate plea for Ian to hold him, the weight of him in Ian's arms. Rest of my life, Jay had said.
Ian closed his eyes and let himself imagine it, just for a moment. A life where Jay meant those words. Where Ian could hold him not just for one night but for all the nights to come. Where this closeness was allowed, accepted. The fantasy hurt more than it comforted.
Ian opened his eyes again, banishing the thoughts. Tomorrow Jay would wake up embarrassed, probably not remembering clearly what he'd said. They would pretend it hadn't happened. Everything would go back to normal.
In the darkness of this room with Jay sleeping peacefully nearby, Ian let himself feel the full weight of what he wanted and couldn't have, the love he'd been suppressing for so long, the hope he kept trying to suffocate.
Hold me for the rest of my life.
"I would," Ian whispered into the darkness. "God help me, I would."

Scene 5
Cruel joke
Jay woke with a faint headache and the vague sense that he had done something terrible.
He kept his eyes closed, trying to piece together the previous night through fragments of memory. Cold air. Stars burning overhead. Warmth. Ian's scent. The feel of being held.
Oh no.
Jay curled into a ball, pulling the blanket over his head. Had he clung to Ian? Had he actually done that? The memory was hazy but undeniable. He'd grabbed onto Ian outside, desperate and pathetic, seeking warmth like a child.
He groaned and pulled at his hair through the blanket. He was an imbecile. A complete and utter imbecile.
What else had he done? What had he said? The memories were frustratingly incomplete, sliding away when he tried to focus on them. Just impressions. The security of Ian's arms around him.
He needed to face this. Whatever damage he'd done, he had to make it right. He sat up slowly and opened his eyes properly. The room was bright. His bed was rumpled from restless sleep. And Ian—
Ian was already up, sitting on the balcony in the freezing weather. A coffee cup sat on the table beside him. He looked like a statue, completely still, staring out at the ocean. It felt like a very bad omen.
On the nightstand beside Jay's bed sat a glass of water and two painkillers.
He took the painkillers, drank the water, and headed to the bathroom. The shower was scalding hot, an attempt to wash away the shame and confusion. He stood under the spray, trying to organize his thoughts.
He'd overstepped badly. He'd made Ian uncomfortable, imposed on him, created a situation that Ian had been too kind to refuse. The worst part was not knowing exactly what he'd done. The gaps in his memory were full of potential disasters.
When he finally emerged from the bathroom, he found Ian exactly where he'd left him. Still on the balcony. Still frozen in place.
Jay's resolve hardened. He wanted nothing more than to hide and never show his face again, but more than anything, he needed to apologize. Ian didn't deserve to face such indignation from his own assistant. Jay would accept whatever punishment came. He'd leave if Ian wanted. He'd report himself to HR. Whatever it took to atone.
He stepped onto the freezing balcony, the cold immediately biting through his sweater. His wet hair made it worse, but he didn't let it deter him.
"Ian, I'm so sorry. I don't remember everything from last night, but I know I—"
Ian cut him off immediately. "You didn't do anything wrong."
"But I—"
"You were drunk. Floppy and mumbling, but otherwise very manageable. You cried a lot, though. Apparently you're a sad drunk."
"I cried?" Jay didn't remember crying. That was somehow more mortifying than if he'd been rowdy or ridiculous. 
"Yes. I had to lull you to sleep."
"I'm sorry."
"Don't be."
"Then why are you out here?"
"I have a strange headache. Feels more like a migraine. I thought the cold would help, but it hardly did."
"Oh. I'm still sorry. For crying. For being a burden."
"You weren't a burden. Come inside. You're going to catch pneumonia."
Back in the warmth of the room, Ian closed the balcony door and turned to face Jay directly. "Nothing happened, Jay. You were upset, I helped you to bed. That's all. You don't need to apologize."
But Jay wasn't entirely convinced. Maybe Ian was just being kind, protecting Jay from the full embarrassment of whatever he'd done.
They packed in near silence, checking the room for forgotten items, zipping up suitcases. At breakfast, fragments of the team were scattered around the tables. Zoe and Luc had apparently left early for another short hike at the cliffs. Ray was in the hot springs with Rin, taking advantage of every last moment. The rest were finishing their food.
"There he is. How's the head?" Max called out when Jay appeared.
"Fine," Jay lied.
"You were pretty far gone last night. We were taking bets on whether you'd make it to breakfast."
"The sauna must have lowered my alcohol tolerance. I barely remember the evening."
"Classic."
After breakfast, Ian suggested they get a hot stone massage. They spent an hour in the spa. Jay felt better afterwards, less panicked about the previous night.
They soaked in one of the pools afterwards, but the peace Jay had felt yesterday was missing. He kept watching Ian, searching for clues about what had really happened.
Ian kept his eyes closed, face tilted toward the sky. "Stop worrying," he said without opening them.
"I'm not—"
"You are. I promise you, everything is fine. I just have a headache. It's going to pass in a day or two."
At lunch, everyone gathered to share final stories before departure. Ray and Rin appeared from the springs. Zoe and Luc returned from their hike, windswept and happy. The flight back was loud, everyone still riding the high of the weekend. 
Ian sat with his eyes closed, headphones in. Jay watched him with worry. Ian really did look unwell. Jay wanted to ask if he was alright, but Ian had already said he was fine, and pushing would only be rude.
When they landed, everyone dispersed. Ian and Jay walked to the car in silence, and the drive back to Jay's apartment was equally quiet. When Ian pulled up outside Jay's building, Jay opened the door, then hesitated. "Ian?"
"Yes?"
"If I did anything—if I said anything that made you uncomfortable, I really am sorry."
"You didn't. I promise. I'll see you Monday."
Jay climbed out of the car, retrieved his suitcase from the trunk, and stood on the sidewalk watching as Ian drove away. The sadness in that final look stayed with him as he rode the elevator up to his apartment. Something had happened. Ian could say nothing was wrong all he wanted, but Jay knew better.
Ian drove home on autopilot. He made it to his building, to his apartment, through his door. He dropped his suitcase in the entryway and walked to his couch, sitting down heavily. Jay's words from the night before echoed endlessly in his head. 
Hold me for the rest of my life.
It would have been easier if Jay had been indifferent. Cold, even. But Jay's sweetness, his innocent adoration, the eagerness with which he'd melted into Ian's embrace—it felt like knives to his heart. An eagerness Ian was never allowed to have. A cruel joke played by fate and circumstance.
It had taken every ounce of Ian's control to sit on that freezing balcony and not show what he was feeling. To reassure Jay that nothing had happened, that everything was fine. It had taken even more control to maintain that facade through the day, to act normal when his heart felt like it was tearing itself apart.
He'd almost broken in the car. The way Jay had looked at him with those wide gray eyes, worried and apologetic—Ian had wanted to pull him back, to tell him the truth. That the night before had been the most painful experience of Ian's life. That Jay had said exactly what Ian had been desperate to hear, and that was the cruellest part of all.
He needed to pull himself together. This weakness was unacceptable. He'd weathered worse than this—betrayal, scandal, exile from his own family. He could handle impossible love. He'd been handling it just fine. He just needed time to steel his heart again. 
A day or two. That's what he'd told Jay, and he'd make it true. By Monday he'd be fine. Everything would return to normal. He was good at controlling himself. Excellent at it, even. But for now, alone in his apartment, he let himself fall apart completely.
