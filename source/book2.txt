Clouds Over Gethsemane

The Impossibility Of It All
Chapter 21: Summer heat
Scene 1
Vigilance
Ian arrived at the office the next morning with the peculiar exhaustion that came from overthinking. The previous evening's revelation had crystallized into cold practicality during the night hours. He was in love with Jay. This was unacceptable. He would manage it appropriately.
The solution was straightforward. Ensure Jay's continued success and happiness within the company and accept that his own discomfort was the necessary price for keeping things stable. He wanted Jay to thrive, to find joy and fulfilment, even if that meant watching from a distance. 
The selfish part of him that craved to keep Jay close warred with the protective instinct that whispered he should transfer Jay to another department, create space for both their sakes. Yet the thought of losing their daily interactions, the comfortable warmth of their established routine, felt unbearable.
He threw himself into work, but his mind was elsewhere. When the team departed for lunch at one of nearby restaurants, he remained at his desk, absorbed in market analysis. He preferred eating alone in the kitchen, but today the thought of food made him nauseous. His meal prep container sat untouched in the company refrigerator.
An hour later, the team returned rejuvenated. Jay moved toward the kitchen, ostensibly to refill his water bottle. He opened the fridge and paused at the sight of Ian's untouched lunch container.
This wasn't normal. In the year Jay had worked here, Ian's habits had been absolutely consistent. The lunch container was always gone by the time they returned to the office.
The afternoon progressed with meetings and conference calls that required Ian's full attention. He welcomed the distraction that prevented his thoughts from wandering to the sounds of Jay working just outside his office door.
A knock interrupted his brooding.
"Come in."
Jay entered, closing the door behind him. "I wanted to check if your lunch wasn't to your liking today."
Ian looked up, confused. "What?"
"You didn't eat lunch. I thought perhaps you'd prefer something different. I could order takeout if you'd like something specific." Jay's tone was matter-of-fact, as if monitoring Ian's eating habits was a part of his responsibilities. "There's a place that makes excellent soup if you're in the mood for something light."
The observation caught Ian completely off guard. He hadn't realized Jay paid attention to such details, much less that he would feel comfortable addressing them directly.
"I..." Ian paused, uncertain how to respond. "Yes, please. The soup sounds fine."
Jay nodded and retreated to his desk to place the order. Ian stared after him, processing what had just occurred. Jay had noticed his skipped meal and taken initiative to remedy it. The gesture was practical and unassuming, yet it represented a level of attentiveness that felt almost intimate.
Thirty minutes later, Jay collected the soup from the delivery service and brought it to the kitchen, along with proper utensils and a cloth napkin from the supply cabinet.
Ian appeared a few minutes later. 
"This looks appetizing," he said, sitting at the table.
The soup was excellent—rich and comforting, exactly what he needed though he hadn't realized it. Jay had returned to his desk, leaving him to eat in solitude as always. As he ate, he dwelled on the strange progression of his relationship with Jay.
Months ago, Jay had approached him with questions about past acquisitions and Ian had rebuffed him sharply. Today, Jay had essentially directed him to eat lunch, and Ian had complied without protest. The change in their dynamic was remarkable, though he couldn't pinpoint exactly when it had occurred.
The care Jay had shown was sincere and undemanding. No expectation of gratitude or acknowledgement, just attention to Ian's well-being. It was this thoughtfulness that made Jay so valuable as an assistant.
When he returned to his office, Jay was organizing files. Their eyes met briefly, and Jay smiled before returning to his work.
Ian sat at his desk, unsettled by how good it felt to be looked after in such simple ways. Jay probably considered meal monitoring part of his general duties, but the warmth it produced was dangerous. Ian wanted to protect that gentle consideration, to ensure Jay never lost the confidence that allowed him to offer help so naturally.
The thought produced both affection and despair in equal measure. This careful, honest young man deserved to be cherished and protected. Ian wanted to shield him from every possible harm. But doing so would cross lines that existed for good reasons.
Meanwhile, Jay returned to his filing with growing concern. The skipped lunch wasn't an isolated incident—he had noticed Ian's distraction throughout the day, the way he seemed to be avoiding casual interaction more than usual.
He glanced at the gleaming watch on his wrist. Ian’s unexpected gift had been accompanied by an even more surprising apology, an expression of regret for past oversights and missteps. The memory of Ian’s hesitant sincerity troubled Jay deeply, and now today’s skipped lunch and increasingly avoidant behaviour only added to his growing mental tally of concerns. Each unusual action felt like another warning sign.
Combined with Ian's adamant refusal to take vacation time, the pattern indicated stress levels that could become problematic. Ian's work ethic was already intense enough to worry Jay. If he started skipping meals on top of everything else, he would make himself seriously ill.
Jay had grown comfortable enough with their working relationship to address the lunch situation directly, something that would have been unthinkable months earlier. The realization surprised him. When had he stopped feeling that reverent distance that once made Ian seem untouchable? When had concern for Ian's health become something he felt entitled to express?
The transformation had occurred so gradually he hadn't noticed it happening. Now Ian felt less like an intimidating superior and more like... Jay wasn't sure how to categorize it. Someone worth looking after. Someone who mattered to him.
He would need to be more vigilant about Ian's habits. Discrete monitoring of lunch consumption, gentle reminders about breaks, perhaps even strategic scheduling of meetings to prevent excessively long work days. Jay glanced toward Ian's office. The soup had obviously helped, which validated Jay's intervention. Someone needed to ensure he took proper care of himself, and Jay was positioned to notice details that others might miss.
Ian remained in his office, and Jay stayed as well, finishing reports that weren't strictly urgent. At six, he prepared a glass of fresh lemonade from the kitchen supplies—unsweetened, with ginger and mint from the herb selection he'd suggested for the office.
He knocked on Ian's door frame again.
"I thought you might like something refreshing."
Ian accepted the glass without question this time. "Thank you."
"It's all natural ingredients. Ginger and mint are good for fatigue."
He left the lemonade on Ian's desk and returned to his work, remembering how Ian had once prepared ginger tea for him when he'd felt unwell. The gesture had meant more than Ian could have known—a sign that someone in this office actually cared about his welfare.
Now, months later, Jay wanted to offer the same consideration.
Scene 2
Planned departures
Ian made a point of eating his packed lunch every day for the rest of the week. The container disappeared punctually during the team's restaurant visits, which seemed to ease the watchful concern in Jay's expression.
As days passed, Ian's initial panic about his feelings lessened. Nothing fundamental had changed, he told himself. The longing had been present for months, he had simply stopped pretending it didn't exist. Recognition didn't require action.
By Thursday, he'd evaluated the projected workload through December and identified a window. Late October showed the lightest commitments, with most major quarterly reviews completed and year-end preparations still weeks away.
Friday afternoon, he called Jay into his office.
"I've decided to take some time off. Last week of October."
Jay's face lit up immediately. "That's wonderful. A full week?"
"Seven days. Monday through Friday."
"I'll submit my request for the same period." Jay's enthusiasm was unmistakable. "A week seems short, but it's much better than nothing."
Ian felt warmth at Jay's obvious pleasure in his decision. "You don't have to coordinate your schedule with mine."
"I'd rather take time when you do. Thank you for being reasonable about this."
That weekend, Jay threw himself into vacation planning. He browsed travel websites, eventually deciding on a week-long tropical getaway that included a beginner diving certification course.
The price made him pause—a year ago, such an expense would have been impossible. But his financial stability had grown along with his confidence, and the cost fell within reasonable limits.
He booked the trip Sunday evening, then researched local diving schools to supplement the vacation training. Zoe had mentioned several reputable instructors during her own diving stories, and Jay found classes that would prepare him for the more intensive tropical course.
Monday brought Zoe's return, bronzed and energetic from her underwater adventures. The team gathered at lunch, eager for details about her expedition.
"The coral formations were incredible," she said, showing photos on her phone. "Visibility was perfect, water temperature ideal. I spent two days just photographing reef fish."
"How deep did you go?" Luc asked.
"Forty meters on the wall dives. But the best sites were actually shallower—more marine life activity."
Jay looked at the images with fascination. "I booked a certification course myself. Tropical location, beginner program."
"Really?" Zoe's expression brightened. "Where?"
"Lagoon Belt. Week-long package with classroom and open water training."
"That's ambitious for a first course. Most people start with pool sessions."
"They include preliminary training. And I found local classes here to prepare."
Zoe pulled out her phone again. "Which school? I know several excellent instructors in the city."
Jay showed her the diving centre's website, and Zoe nodded approvingly.
"I know someone who teaches there. She's patient with beginners but maintains high safety standards."
"Would you like to come to my first lesson? This Thursday evening."
"Absolutely. We can grab dinner afterwards and discuss equipment basics."
Around the table, the team exchanged glances. Zoe's mentoring relationship with Jay was starting to approach friendship, a development that was fairly unexpected.
Amy returned on Monday as well, bringing the team back to full capacity just as Luc and Max prepared for their own departures. The office was fully staffed for five days before the next round of absences began.
Jay had grown so accustomed to extended hours that he remained late even with full coverage. Tuesday evening, when he typically left promptly for the gym, he stayed until past six o'clock.
Ian noticed the deviation. "Did you quit the gym?"
Jay looked up from his computer. "No, I moved my schedule an hour later. I'll go straight from here."
He opened his office closet to reveal a gym bag. "More convenient than going home first."
"How is your routine progressing?"
Jay's expression turned sheepish. "I'm far from fit, but definitely stronger than a few months ago. The trainer says my form has improved."
Ian was curious about this aspect of Jay's life. He'd spent months maintaining distance, but what purpose did that serve now? He was already compromised. These small insights into Jay's daily existence were the only intimacy he could permit himself.
"What type of training do you focus on?"
"Basic strength training, some cardio. Nothing sophisticated. The gym I chose is more practical than impressive, but it suits my needs."
"Consistency matters more than intensity."
"That's what I keep telling myself when I'm struggling with weights that probably seem trivial to most people."
The self-deprecation was typical of Jay, but Ian detected something else underneath the modest assessment. Jay was proud of his progress, even if he wouldn't admit it directly.
"Building habits takes discipline," Ian said. "The results will follow."
Jay smiled at the encouragement. "Thank you. I should get going if I want to make my session time."
"Have a good workout."
"Thank you."
Ian watched Jay gather his belongings and head toward the elevators. The brief conversation had revealed details about Jay's life that felt almost intimate in their ordinariness—gym habits, personal goals, small victories in self-improvement.
He wanted to know more. What other changes had Jay made in his life over the past year? What did he do on weekends? How did he spend his evenings when he wasn't working late?
The curiosity was dangerous but irresistible. Ian was already emotionally invested, seeking these small glimpses into Jay's world couldn't make the situation worse. If he couldn't have Jay in any meaningful way, at least he could indulge in learning about the person who had become so important to him.
What harm could a few casual questions cause? He was already in too deep for caution to matter, and he intended to take advantage of every opportunity Jay offered.
The decision felt like a small surrender, but also like relief. He would ask about Jay's diving lessons, his vacation plans, his weekend activities. He would show interest in Jay's life because he cared, and because denying that care had become more exhausting than acknowledging it.
He could find peace in that. Love didn't require possession. It could exist as pure wish for another person's flourishing, even if that flourishing led them away from him. Perhaps especially then.
Scene 3
Diving lesson
The full staff roster meant Jay could leave on Thursday promptly at five without guilt—a reprieve that wouldn't return until September when vacation season concluded. Zoe met him at the elevator, holding a waterproof duffel bag containing serious diving equipment.
"Ready for this?" she asked as they descended toward the lobby.
"As ready as I can be for voluntarily submerging myself in water while breathing through a tube."
"That's the spirit."
The dive centre had multiple training pools of varying depths and a classroom area filled with equipment displays. Jay felt his nervousness increase as they approached the facility.
"Remember," Zoe said as they entered, "you've done this before. Today is just building proper foundations."
The instructor, a weathered woman named Ina who clearly knew Zoe well, guided Jay through equipment basics. Mask fitting, regulator breathing, buoyancy control—all concepts Jay recognized but still needed to practice.
"Don't overthink it," Ina advised as Jay struggled with buoyancy in the shallow end. "Your body knows how to float."
Zoe accompanied him in the water but left instruction to Ina, offering encouragement from a distance. Jay appreciated the balance—moral support without interference. His movements were clumsy and his breathing occasionally erratic, but the panic from his first diving experience was notably absent.
By the end of the session, Jay had managed several controlled descents to the pool's deepest section and felt moderately confident about basic skills. Not graceful, but functional enough to imagine enjoying the activity.
"Much better than I expected," Ina concluded as they returned equipment. "September lessons will build on this foundation nicely."
"How many more sessions would you recommend before my trip?" Jay asked.
"Four or five should give you solid confidence for open water diving. "
"You might consider adding pool time for general water comfort," Zoe said as they changed back into street clothes. "There's excellent facilities throughout the city."
"That's a good idea. I want to be completely prepared."
Zoe proposed dinner at a nearby restaurant to discuss the experience, and Jay readily agreed. The invitation felt natural after their successful lesson, though he realized he knew very little about Zoe beyond her office persona.
"You made that look effortless," Jay observed over appetizers. "How long have you been diving?"
"Since college. Being a city kid, it was the only way to experience anything resembling nature."
"You're from here originally?"
"Born and raised. Third generation native, actually, which makes me practically prehistoric by local standards."
"I still feel awkward about living here. Small town to big city isn't exactly seamless."
"Nobody cares where you're from. Trust me, half our office moved here from somewhere else. You blend in perfectly now."
The reassurance was unexpectedly comforting. Jay had assumed his origins were more obvious than they apparently were.
"Speaking of blending in," Jay said, "I've been apartment hunting. Any neighbourhood recommendations?"
"What's your priority? Short commute, nightlife, quiet residential?"
"Definitely short commute. I spend enough time at the office that I'd prefer not to waste hours traveling. But it still needs to be something I can afford."
Zoe launched into detailed advice about areas with convenient metro access that remained reasonably priced. Her knowledge of the city was encyclopedic, covering everything from grocery stores to safety considerations.
"Avoid anything within walking distance of the financial district unless you enjoy paying exorbitant prices for a closet," she warned. "But there are some great neighbourhoods three stops out that give you space without sacrificing convenience."
Jay enjoyed the conversation. Zoe was more talkative and personable than in the office, with practical insights about city living that Jay hadn't considered. Their conversation eventually returned to his upcoming trip, covering travel experiences, equipment recommendations, and underwater photography techniques.
"I never realized you were so adventurous," Jay said.
"Most people don't. I prefer keeping work and personal interests separate."
"But you made an exception tonight."
"You're interested in diving, not just looking for another social activity."
"This has been really helpful," Jay said as they prepared to leave. "Thank you for coming along."
"My pleasure. Text me after your next lesson—I want to hear how the skills progression goes."
Meanwhile, Ian remained in the office well past normal hours, ostensibly reviewing client portfolios but actually achieving very little productive work. The afternoon had dragged without Jay, punctuated by mundane tasks that felt more tedious than usual.
He knew Jay was at his diving lesson with Zoe, pursuing an activity that would enhance his upcoming vacation. This was positive development—Jay expanding his interests, building friendships with colleagues, gaining confidence in new skills.
Ian should feel pleased about Jay's growth and happiness. Instead, he wished he could be the one accompanying Jay to new experiences, sharing in discoveries and celebrations. The thought of Jay laughing with Zoe, discussing vacation plans, produced discomfort that Ian recognized as dangerously close to jealousy.
The realization was unwelcome. He wanted to be part of Jay's life. Instead, he sat alone in an empty office, pretending to work while actually counting the hours until Jay returned tomorrow morning. By seven o'clock, Ian abandoned any pretence of productivity and headed home, taking with him work that would likely remain untouched for the remainder of the evening.
Back in his apartment, Jay researched swimming facilities near the office. He found a modern complex with extended hours, including evening sessions that would accommodate his irregular schedule. Pool time could supplement diving lessons while improving general fitness.
The schedule would require planning around his extended work hours, but Jay didn't mind. Tuesday afternoons would remain reserved for gym sessions, while other evenings could incorporate swimming when he managed to leave by reasonable hours.
The gym training had given him confidence in his physical capabilities that extended beyond simple strength improvement. Adding swimming felt like a natural progression.
He booked a trial membership for the following week, already anticipating the additional preparation it would provide for his diving adventure. The diving lesson had reinforced his excitement about the upcoming vacation while highlighting areas for improvement.
Jay fell asleep reviewing certification requirements and equipment lists. The lesson had gone better than expected, Zoe had proven an unexpectedly compatible companion, and his vacation planning was proceeding smoothly.
Scene 4
Sunset brooding
Ian arrived at the office Friday morning to find Jay already at his desk, reviewing client correspondence. The sight produced a flutter of warmth that Ian immediately recognized as absurd—he had missed Jay for exactly one afternoon, yet his relief at seeing him again felt disproportionate to the brief separation.
"Good morning," Jay said cheerfully, looking up from his work.
Ian's heart responded with a skip. The ridiculousness of pining like a Victorian widow over a few hours apart wasn't lost on him, but awareness didn't diminish the feeling.
"Good morning," Ian replied, and instead of proceeding directly to his office, he paused beside Jay's desk. "How did the diving lesson go yesterday?"
Jay responded with evident enthusiasm. "Better than expected. I managed not to panic underwater, which feels like progress. The instructor thinks I won't drown on my vacation, which is reassuring."
"That's encouraging."
"I'm also planning to add swimming. There's a pool with convenient hours near the office, so I can fit in sessions when my schedule allows."
"Swimming is excellent preparation for diving. Building comfort in water translates well to underwater activities."
"That's what Zoe mentioned. She's been very helpful with practical advice."
The brief conversation concluded naturally, but Ian retained the warmth of it throughout the morning. He savoured these small moments of connection, finding comfort in the glimpses into Jay's life that felt intimate simply because they were so casual.
Jay returned his attention to his computer, unconsciously touching the watch face. The weight on his wrist still felt alien. He had never worn jewellery of any kind, finding accessories excessive and unnecessary. Now the constant reminder of Ian's unexpected generosity felt increasingly significant.
Throughout the day, Ian noticed Jay's expanded social interactions with their colleagues. Previously, Luc had been Jay's primary conversational partner for casual office exchanges. Now Jay chatted with Zoe as well—brief discussions about diving techniques, city neighbourhoods, weekend plans that Ian couldn't help overhearing from his adjacent office.
"Here's my number," Zoe said during one such conversation. "Text me about those pool recommendations I mentioned."
Ian felt an unreasonable stab of jealousy at the casual exchange of personal contact information. He had Jay's number from HR files, but technical access felt entirely different from the personal gesture of voluntary sharing. As Jay's supervisor, he couldn't simply request personal numbers without justification. The jealousy was irrational and petty, but it left Ian feeling moody for the remainder of the afternoon.
As evening approached, Max's upcoming vacation created additional preparation demands that kept both Ian and Jay working past normal hours. Ian deliberately extended tasks that could have been completed more efficiently, reluctant to end the day and lose Jay's company.
By eight o'clock, Jay appeared tired and hungry, gathering his belongings with the obvious intention of departing. He approached Ian's office door, which had remained open throughout the day.
"I'm heading out," Jay said. "Are you planning to work much later?"
Ian glanced at his computer screen, where no meaningful work was actually in progress. "I want to finish something I'm working on. Don't wait on my account."
The lie came easily, though Ian immediately felt guilty about it. He wasn't working on anything pressing, he was simply stalling because he wanted to preserve these moments for as long as possible.
"Have a good evening," Jay said.
"You too."
Ian watched Jay collect his things and head toward the elevators, fighting the impulse to call him back with some fabricated urgent task. After Jay disappeared from view, Ian remained at his desk, staring at the city skyline visible through his office windows.
Two full days without seeing Jay. Forty-eight hours of wondering what he was doing, whether he was enjoying his time off, if he thought about work—about Ian—at all during his personal hours.
Ian had never particularly enjoyed weekends, preferring the structure and purpose of office. Now he was beginning to actively dread them.
The August heat had been oppressive all week. The evening sun was beginning its descent toward the horizon, casting long shadows across the financial district. The sky held that particular quality of late summer light—golden and heavy, suggesting the gradual approach of autumn despite the continued warmth.
As the sun sank lower, painting the office in amber light, Ian acknowledged the futility of his position. He was in love with his assistant, jealous of his friendships, and inventing reasons to extend their shared time. None of it was sustainable, yet he couldn't imagine changing course.
The sunset continued its slow progression, and Ian continued watching, lost in thoughts that offered no solutions to his increasingly complicated feelings.
Jay rode the metro home with lingering concern about Ian's work habits. Staying past eight on Friday evening seemed excessive even by Turner & Associates standards, particularly when no urgent deadlines justified the extended hours.
Back in his apartment, Jay reheated leftover dinner and took a quick shower, exhaustion overtaking him as the week's activities caught up. As he prepared for bed, his eyes fell on the watch he had placed on his nightstand.
The anniversary gift still felt impossibly extravagant, something he probably shouldn't have accepted despite Ian's insistence. The monetary value remained staggering, but the expense wasn't what made the gift significant. It was the fact that Ian had chosen it, had taken time to consider what Jay might appreciate, had wanted to acknowledge their working relationship with something meaningful and permanent.
Jay fell asleep thinking about Ian's earnest apology, the careful way he had presented the gift, the concern he had shown for Jay's well-being throughout their year together. The watch had come from Ian, and that made it precious for reasons that had nothing to do with its cost.
Scene 5
Weekend exploration
On Saturday the heat was so oppressive that it made even the gym feel stifling despite its air conditioning. Jay completed his routine, eager to finish weekend chores before the temperature became truly unbearable. By noon, he had managed laundry, grocery shopping, and basic apartment maintenance, leaving the afternoon free for apartment hunting.
He texted Zoe for recommendations about which areas to prioritize, expecting a brief response with suggestions. Instead, she offered to accompany him on his exploration, which surprised Jay but also pleased him. A local's perspective would be invaluable for understanding neighbourhood dynamics he might miss entirely.
"I know the city better than any real estate website. Plus I have strong opinions about local amenities," she had replied.
They met at a metro station Zoe had selected for its central location among the areas Jay wanted to explore. She arrived with a water bottle, comfortable walking shoes, and a practical shoulder bag, clearly experienced with extended urban hiking.
She indicated the map on her phone. "Strategic planning. We can cover four neighbourhoods efficiently if we're systematic about it."
The heat was brutal, but Jay appreciated seeing potential areas under challenging conditions. If a neighbourhood felt acceptable during August's worst weather, it would be pleasant during milder seasons.
They spent the afternoon moving between neighbourhoods, riding metro lines to different stops and walking through residential areas that offered varying combinations of affordability, accessibility, and livability. Zoe provided running commentary about safety considerations and transportation reliability that Jay would never have discovered through online research alone.
"That building looks nice from the outside," Jay observed about a council house with attractive brick facades.
"Terrible insulation and no decent grocery stores within walking distance," Zoe replied immediately. "Trust me, aesthetic appeal isn't worth freezing in winter or living on takeout."
Several buildings caught Jay's attention as promising options. He made notes about agents to contact once September arrived and his work schedule became more manageable.
By evening, they were both exhausted from hours of walking in relentless heat. Zoe suggested dinner at a restaurant in one of the neighbourhoods Jay had found most appealing—a vegetarian place with outdoor seating and fans that created tolerable conditions despite the temperature.
Jay agreed readily, though vegetarian cuisine wasn't typically his preference. The restaurant was small and welcoming, with an extensive menu that was more appealing than he had anticipated.
"This is actually really good," he admitted, sampling a grain bowl with interesting spice combinations.
"You sound surprised."
"I default to more conventional food choices. But this has a lot more flavour than I expected."
Over dinner, their conversation drifted from apartment hunting to work experiences and personal backgrounds. Jay was relaxed, perhaps due to the informal setting or Zoe's easy-going demeanour.
"Can I ask why you applied to Turner & Associates specifically? It's not exactly an obvious choice for someone without extensive finance background," Zoe asked.
"Honestly? Ian's reputation was a major factor. His management style seemed principled and straightforward, without the complications I'd encountered elsewhere."
"Complications?"
"Previous supervisors who didn't maintain appropriate boundaries. Ian's known for hating office romance, which made the position feel safer."
Zoe nodded with understanding. "That was exactly my reasoning. Being openly gay can be tricky, but Ian's reputation made Turner & Associates feel like a place where I wouldn't have to worry about my sexuality becoming an issue."
The casual revelation surprised Jay, though he tried not to show it. "I'm glad the environment has lived up to expectations."
"It has, mostly because Ian really does provide excellent protection from workplace drama. I hope that doesn't make you uncomfortable. I'm private about personal details, but you seem like someone I can trust."
"Not uncomfortable at all. I may be from a small town, but I'm not quite that provincial."
Zoe visibly relaxed. "I tend to keep my head down out of habit. You never know who might have hidden prejudices, even in supposedly progressive environments. But I felt safe with you because, well, I assumed you were gay as well."
Jay felt heat rise in his face. "I don't really think I'm gay."
"Oh." Zoe looked mortified. "I'm sorry, I shouldn't have assumed—"
"It's alright, honestly. Not a big deal. I'm just not interested in dating anyone, truth be told."
Zoe's expression brightened with recognition. "Ah, so you're ace! That's wonderful. It's nice having one of us queers on the team."
Jay had never heard the term applied to himself before, but it didn't feel wrong. "I never thought much about it. There were always other priorities."
That wasn't entirely true. He had attempted romance back in college, but it had ended in such spectacular failure that he had never felt comfortable exploring that territory again. The memory still made him uncomfortable years later, but it wasn't something he was prepared to confess to anyone, let alone a coworker he was meeting privately for only the second time.
"Fair enough. Labels aren't for everyone anyway."
They continued talking as the evening cooled slightly, bonding over their shared appreciation for Ian's protective aura at work. Both had sought refuge in his reputation, and both had found exactly the security they needed.
"He really is impenetrable steel wall against workplace nonsense," Zoe observed. "I've never felt more comfortable in an office environment."
"Same. He creates this bubble of professionalism that keeps everything else at bay."
"Thanks for spending your Saturday on this. I learned more about these neighbourhoods in one afternoon than I would have managed in weeks of research," Jay said as they prepared to leave.
"It was fun. Let me know when you're ready to look at actual units. I have strong opinions about building management, too."
Jay left the restaurant feeling satisfied with both his apartment prospects and his expanding social circle. Having an actual friendship with a coworker was a new experience, but one he found remarkably pleasant.
Chapter 22: Schemer and imp
Scene 1
Travel anxiety
On Monday morning Jay sat at his desk, staring at his phone screen for the third time in ten minutes. The email from Adventure Diving Tours sat in his inbox like an unexploded device, full of passport requirements, flight information, and medical forms that needed completion.
What had seemed like such a brilliant idea last week now felt monumentally stupid. He had booked the October diving trip in a moment of euphoria, riding high on successfully convincing Ian to take actual time off—a victory that had felt impossible just months ago. The confidence he felt during that conversation had evaporated completely.
"Morning, Jay." Amy's greeting pulled him from his spiraling thoughts.
"Good morning." He managed what he hoped was a normal smile and buried himself in spreadsheets. Max and Luc had started their holidays, leaving the rest of the team to shoulder their workload. The extra hours were a welcome distraction, even if they meant staying past eight most nights.
The morning crawled by. During the daily briefing with Ian he struggled to concentrate. Every time he tried to focus on client reports, his mind wandered back to the same terrifying thoughts. He had never been on a plane. He had never left the country. He had barely traveled beyond the city limits since he moved here. What had possessed him to think he could handle flying solo to a foreign country and jumping off a boat into deep water?
Ian emerged from his office around eleven, scanning the department. His eyes lingered on Jay's desk for a moment longer than usual before he moved toward the conference room.
Jay's phone buzzed with another email from the dive company asking about dietary restrictions and emergency contacts. The panic crept higher in his chest.
Tuesday brought no relief, but there wasn't time to worry about October when August was trying to kill them all with overtime. Jay threw himself into the extra responsibilities, tackling reports that normally would have been distributed among the team.
At six o'clock sharp, he packed up and headed to the gym, holding on to the habit that had become his anchor. The weight of the barbells usually cleared his head, but today even Rus noticed something was off.
"You're pushing too hard today," his trainer said, watching Jay attempt another set despite his obvious fatigue. "What's going on?"
"Just work stuff," Jay lied, racking the weights with hands that trembled slightly. "The usual deadlines."
"Whatever's eating at you, the weights aren't going to solve it. Maybe try talking to someone who actually has ears instead of iron plates."
Jay managed a weak smile but said nothing. How could he explain that the person he most wanted to talk to was the one person he couldn't burden with his pathetic fears?
On Wednesday evening Jay and Ian were alone in the office again, the fluorescent lights casting a harsh glow over empty desks. The building had fallen into its nighttime quiet, broken only by the occasional ping of the elevator.
Jay stared at his computer screen, but the numbers weren't making sense anymore. The diving company had sent yet another email, this one with a packing list that included things he'd never heard of. He put his hands over his face and let out a long sigh.
"Jay? Is something wrong?" 
Jay startled, dropping his hands and looking up to find Ian standing beside his desk. Jay hadn't heard him approach. Ian's suit jacket was gone, his tie loosened slightly, sleeves rolled up to his forearms. It was as casual as Jay had ever seen him during work hours.
Jay laughed bitterly. "No, nothing's wrong. I might have just bitten off more than I can chew with this October trip."
Ian's eyebrows drew together slightly. "The diving course? You seemed excited."
"I was excited. I am excited. It's just..." Jay gestured helplessly at his phone. "I booked this trip thinking I was being so brave and adventurous, but Ian, I've never even been on a plane. I've never left the country. I don't know what I was thinking. They're asking for all these forms and requirements, and I keep staring at them thinking I'm going to mess something up or panic halfway through the flight or—"
"Jay. You're catastrophizing."
"Am I? Because it feels pretty realistic from where I'm sitting."
Ian moved closer, sitting on the chair across from Jay's desk. "You're learning to dive. You'll pass the basic  certifications. Just like you've handled every challenge this job has thrown at you."
"That's different. That's work. This is..." Jay trailed off, struggling to articulate the depth of his anxiety.
"This is you expanding your world. Which is exactly what you should be doing."
The confidence in Ian's words made Jay feel calmer. He had grown to trust Ian's judgment implicitly over the past year.
"I suppose I'll figure it out," Jay said finally.
Ian was quiet for a long moment, watching Jay with an expression that was difficult to read. "Yes, you will," he said eventually. 
"You've probably been flying since you were five."
"Seven. My first flight was for a mountain skiing holiday. I was terrified the plane would fall out of the sky."
"Really?"
"I refused to look out the window for the entire flight. My mother had to bribe me with chocolate just to stop me crying during take-off."
The image of a young Ian crying on a plane was so incongruous with the composed man standing before him that Jay almost smiled despite his anxiety. "Did it get better?"
"Yes, with practice. And realizing that being afraid of something doesn't mean you can't do it anyway."
Jay nodded, though his stomach was still churning. "I keep telling myself that. It's just hard when everyone expects you to know what you're doing."
"No one expects that, Jay. And anyone who does isn't worth worrying about."
There was something in Ian's voice that made Jay look up at him. Ian was watching him with an expression Jay couldn't quite read, looking softer than usual.
"Thank you," Jay said.
Thursday and Friday flew by, consumed by overtime and catch-up work. Jay managed to fill out most of the diving forms, though the flight details still made his stomach clench with anxiety. He had almost succeeded in pushing the entire issue to the back of his mind when Ian called him into his office Friday afternoon.
"Close the door, please," Ian said.
Jay complied, sitting on the chair across from Ian's desk. 
"I've arranged a business trip to the New Continent for the end of September. Garnet Ridge Group has expressed interest in our services, and their CEO is an old university acquaintance. The timing works well—it's before the chaos of quarter-end in October, and the matter has been on my list long enough."
"That sounds like something Leo would typically handle."
"Under normal circumstances, yes. But given my personal connection to their leadership, direct involvement seems more appropriate. More importantly, I believe this presents an excellent training opportunity for you."
"Training opportunity?"
"Business travel will likely become a requirement at some point in your role. Instead of waiting for an urgent situation to arise, it seems prudent to provide you with that experience during a lower-stakes engagement. Administration will handle all logistics. Your responsibilities would mirror those you've successfully managed in previous client meetings."
Jay felt his pulse quicken, but not with panic. Instead, relief began to unfold in his stomach. "You want me to come with you?"
"I believe the experience would be valuable for your development. The meeting itself is straightforward, and having you handle the standard preparation and documentation would be beneficial for both parties."
"Should I prepare anything specific?"
"I'll brief you on Garnet Ridge Group next week. For now, just ensure your passport is current."
"It is." Jay hesitated, then added, "This timing is incredibly helpful, actually. Having some international travel experience before my diving trip will probably make everything less terrifying."
"It is rather convenient, yes."
Walking back to his desk, Jay felt lighter than he had all week. The October trip still loomed, but now it felt manageable. He had weeks to prepare, and he'd have Ian there to guide him through his first international experience.
Behind his closed office door, Ian stared at his computer screen without seeing it. The relief in Jay's eyes had been worth every string he'd pulled to arrange this trip on short notice. The fact that he was being completely transparent about his motivations—and that Jay seemed oblivious to the deeper implications—only reinforced what Ian already knew about Jay's honest nature.
He was walking a dangerous path, using his position to ease Jay's personal anxiety. But watching Jay struggle alone with something Ian could easily help him through had been unbearable. This was the closest he could come to the support he truly wanted to offer without crossing lines that couldn't be uncrossed.
That he would get to spend several days in Jay's company, watching over him and ensuring his comfort, felt like a reward he had claimed for himself, one he knew he had little right to.
But Jay's smile would sustain him through whatever pretences he'd have to maintain. Sometimes, love meant finding ways to care from the shadows, and Ian was becoming an expert at loving Jay Hall in precisely that way.
Scene 2
Wishful thinking
Ian sat in his home office, scrolling through hotel listings on his laptop while the Garnet Ridge files lay scattered across the coffee table. He clicked through photos, searching for somewhere comfortable but not intimate—welcoming and cosy, without the risk of seeming romantic. Other tabs were open with flight schedules and a city map. He took notes on arrival procedures, ground transportation, every detail that might ease the anxiety he’d seen in Jay. Nothing could be left to chance.
The doorbell rang, interrupting his research. Ian frowned at his watch—nearly nine on a Saturday evening. He wasn't expecting anyone. The doorbell rang again, followed by an impatient knock.
"Ian, I know you're home. Your car's in the garage."
Leo's voice could be heard through the door. Ian sighed and set down his papers.
"Good evening, Leo." Ian opened the door to find his friend holding a bottle of expensive scotch and wearing that particular grin that meant trouble. "To what do I owe this unexpected visit?"
"Can't a man drop by to see his dearest friend?" Leo pushed past Ian into the apartment, already making himself at home. "I heard that Garnet Ridge Group suddenly became urgent enough to warrant your personal attention. Strange, considering that it's been sitting in your maybe-someday file for months."
Ian closed the door and followed Leo to the living room, where his friend was already examining the spread of documents.
"Business priorities change. You know this."
"Mm-hmm." Leo set the scotch on the side table and sat down in Ian's armchair like he owned it. "And the fact that you're personally handling what should be my territory has nothing to do with wanting some quality alone time with your assistant?"
"I don't know what you're implying."
"Oh, I think you do. Ian Hagen, the man who delegates travel to subordinates as a matter of principle, suddenly decides that an unimportant client meeting requires his personal touch. Along with his assistant, naturally."
"Think whatever you want to think."
Leo's delighted laughter filled the apartment. "There it is! The classic Ian deflection. You might as well have tattooed 'I'm planning a romantic getaway' across your forehead."
"Are you going to open that bottle, or did you bring it as decoration?"
"Changing the subject already?" But Leo obliged, producing glasses from Ian's kitchen. "I'm just saying, if you're planning to wine and dine young Mr. Hall in exotic locations, you might want to book somewhere with a decent spa. Maybe one of those places with couples' treatments."
"It's a business trip."
"Of course it is." Leo poured generous measures of scotch and handed one to Ian. "I'm sure the romantic sunset dinners and moonlit walks on the beach are just coincidental."
Ian accepted the glass and took a measured sip, Leo's commentary washing over him like background noise. His friend had always been incorrigible, and years of experience had taught Ian that engagement only encouraged him.
"You know what I love about this? You're actually living again instead of hiding behind that fortress of yours. It's been what, five years since you showed interest in anything beyond quarterly reports and gym schedules?"
"I'm ensuring a team member receives appropriate guidance."
"Right. Ian, I've been watching you two for months. The way you smooth every possible bump in his path. It's not mentorship, it's devotion."
Ian's jaw tightened, but he kept his voice level. "Jay is a valuable employee who deserves support."
"Jay is a valuable employee you're completely gone over. You know, you should probably be gentle with the poor puppy. Jay's so desperately in love with you that if you're too distant during your little trip, you might break his heart."
"Don't be ridiculous."
"Ridiculous? Ian, everyone can see it. The boy's been head over heels since day one. Honestly, it's sweet that the romance is finally progressing."
"Jay's feelings toward me is gratitude for a stable work environment. Given his previous trauma, he's hardly likely to develop romantic feelings for a boss."
"Previous trauma that you've spent over a year healing with your patient, soothing care? Oh, my naive friend. You really don't see it, do you? The way he watches you when he thinks no one's looking? The way he hangs on your every word? The absolute devastation when he thought you didn't trust him?"
"That was about respect—"
"Respect my ass. He doesn't look at anyone else the way he looks at you. Hell, he barely looks at anyone else at all. Ian, the way that man looks at you isn't gratitude. It's adoration. He lights up like the sun when you give him the smallest bit of approval—"
"He's conscientious and eager to please. That's what makes him an excellent assistant."
"And the way he worries about you? Makes sure you eat lunch? Stays late just to keep you company? You're brilliant at reading markets and people, but you're completely blind when it comes to Jay Hall."
"You're seeing what you want to see."
"Am I? Then explain why he turns pink every time you compliment his work. Why he stays late whenever you do, even when there's no reason for it."
"He's dedicated to his job."
"He's dedicated to you." Leo drained his glass and reached for the bottle. "Mark my words, this trip is going to be very educational for both of you. Might want to pack some extra supplies. A liter of good lube should—"
"Get out."
Leo burst into laughter at Ian's sharp tone. "Struck a nerve, did I? When was the last time you even let yourself think about him that way?"
Ian stood and moved to the window, his back to his friend. "Leave. Now. I think you've had enough entertainment for one evening."
"All right, all right. I'll behave." But Leo's voice still held traces of amusement. "Just promise me you'll be kind to him, Ian. Whatever happens on this trip."
Ian remained silent, watching the city lights blur and sharpen as he tried to ignore the heat that had started burning low in his belly at Leo's words. The image his friend had painted was both impossible and unbearably tempting.
"There's nothing to be kind about. It's a business trip."
"If you say so." Leo finished his second drink and stood. "But Ian, seriously—I'm happy for you. You found someone worth caring about again. Don't let fear rob you of something real just because you're terrified of making the same mistakes."
"The situation is nothing like before."
"No, it's not. Jay isn't playing games or angling for advantage. That boy would walk through fire for you." Leo paused at the door. "Maybe it's time you stopped punishing yourself for someone else's sins."
Ian waited until he heard the front door close before allowing himself to slump against the window. Leo's words echoed in his mind, painting pictures that Ian had spent months trying to suppress. The idea that Jay might feel something beyond respect was both thrilling and terrifying.
But no. Leo was wrong. He had to be wrong. Jay was innocent, earnest, and nothing more. Anything else was projection, wishful thinking, dangerous fantasy.
Ian returned to his papers, but the numbers swam before his eyes. Leo's crude suggestion hung in the air like smoke, heating his blood. The scotch burned as he finished his glass, but it did nothing to cool the fire Leo's words had ignited.
Ian poured himself another glass and tried to return to his research, but he couldn't concentrate. His mind kept spiraling into territories he'd forbidden himself to explore.
He imagined Jay in a hotel room, nervous about his first international trip, turning to Ian for reassurance. The thought of comforting him, of Jay's warmth and trust, led to darker imaginings—Jay's gray eyes looking up at him with something deeper than gratitude, hands reaching for him, that soft voice whispering his name.
Ian finished his drink and tried to prepare for bed, but his body betrayed him with its urgent response to thoughts he'd suppressed for months. In the darkness of his bedroom, he finally allowed himself to imagine Jay's pale skin beneath his hands.
The release, when it came, was intense—months of control shattered by one evening of Leo's meddling. Ian lay in the aftermath, breathing hard and staring at the ceiling, knowing he'd crossed a line in his mind that he could never uncross.
Scene 3
Meddling
Jay was gathering reports for the weekly review in the print room Monday morning when Leo appeared so suddenly in the doorway that Jay almost dropped the papers. Leo shut the door behind him.
"Perfect timing. I was hoping to catch you."
"Leo. Did you need something printed?" Jay said warily. Leo's unexpected appearances often meant some form of chaos.
"We need to talk about your upcoming international debut."
"Is there something specific about the Garnet Ridge meeting?"
"Since you'll be our international face alongside Ian, administration needs to arrange some appointments for you."
"Appointments?"
"Tailor and styling. Business expenses, naturally." Leo's said as if this were procedure. "You've done excellent work upgrading your wardrobe—those suits look fantastic on you—but international travel requires special considerations. You need to be absolutely impeccable, match Ian's level of presentation."
The compliment about his appearance made Jay's cheeks warm slightly. Over the past year, he'd invested in better clothing, understanding that his role required a certain standard. It seemed he wasn't wrong. "I wasn't aware there were specific requirements for international meetings."
"Not requirements, exactly. More like unspoken expectations. The clients we're meeting operate at a particular level. Every detail matters. Hair appointment just before you leave with the best stylist in the city. He typically handles executives and politicians. Tailor appointment next week so there's time for any adjustments."
Jay nodded slowly. It made sense, even if it felt overwhelming. "If that's what's needed for the company's image."
"It is. This trip matters more than you realize. Since Ian decided to take you with him, it's clear he cares deeply about you, feels responsible for your success here. I haven't seen him invest this much in someone's development since..." He paused, his expression growing distant. "Well, since he learned some hard lessons about trust and workplace relationships."
"What do you mean?"
"Ian's been different since you arrived. More engaged, less isolated. He smiles occasionally. Small changes, but noticeable ones for someone who spent years in emotional exile. You've been good for him, Jay. Better than I think you realize."
Jay stared at his hands, processing this information. "I'm just doing my job."
"You're doing much more than that, and Ian knows it. Which is why I need to ask something of you." Leo's tone changed, becoming more serious than Jay had ever heard it. "Be mindful of how much he's opened up to you. Ian's history with workplace complications left him... fragile. The last time he allowed someone close, it ended badly. Very badly."
"I would never—"
"I know you wouldn't intentionally cause harm. But Ian has given you access to parts of himself he keeps locked away from everyone else. The late nights, the mentorship, the way he watches out for you—it's not standard procedure." Leo's eyes were intent on Jay's face. "Just be gentle with him. Don't take advantage of your unique position so close to him."
"I don't understand what you're suggesting."
"I'm not suggesting anything. I'm just saying that Ian might be more involved in your success than he'd ever acknowledge, and that kind of emotional investment makes him vulnerable. You have the power to hurt him deeply, Jay. I've seen what that looks like, and I'd rather not see it again."
"Leo, I would never hurt Ian. He's been nothing but kind to me."
"I believe that. Which is exactly why I'm trusting you with this information. Just remember that behind all that composure is someone who cares about you more than he should, probably more than he realizes himself. His heart might be more in your hands than you know."
After Leo departed, Jay returned to his desk, his mind reeling. The implications of Leo's words circled through his thoughts like persistent echoes. The idea that Ian might harbour feelings beyond mentorship had never occurred to him. But now, examined through Leo's lens, certain moments took on new significance. Ian's expression when they worked late together. His attention to Jay's comfort and development.
Jay shook his head, trying to dismiss the spiraling thoughts. It was preposterous. Ian was accomplished, powerful, completely in control of every situation, surrounded by brilliant and beautiful people. The possibility that someone like Jay could matter to him beyond utility was laughable.
But Leo's words forced uncomfortable questions to surface. What if there was something deeper behind those moments of guidance? Ian's patient explanations, his protective interventions, the way he'd arranged this business trip with perfect timing to ease Jay's travel anxiety. Was it simple mentorship, or something more personal?
No. Ian was simply noble, a leader who cared about his team's well-being. Jay was reading too much into Leo's words, letting his meddling create problems where none existed. 
But Leo's warning echoed persistently: Be gentle with his heart.
What if Ian's heart really was in Jay's hands, and there was something fragile there that could be broken? The thought of causing Ian any pain made Jay uneasy. 
The questions multiplied while Jay forced himself to focus on his work, but the seed Leo had planted continued to grow, impossible to ignore. Whatever Ian's feelings might be, Jay was certain of one thing—he would rather die than cause harm to the person who'd given him so much.
Jay felt a renewed sense of purpose burning in his chest. If Ian was truly fragile, if he'd been hurt by betrayal, then Jay would do everything in his power to prove himself worthy of the trust he'd been given. He would be the pillar of support Ian deserved, the one person who would never disappoint him.
The rest of the day was productive. Jay threw himself into covering Max and Luc's responsibilities with even greater determination, ensuring every detail was perfect. One more week until the team returned to full capacity. He would make certain everything ran smoothly.
That evening, as the office emptied, Jay made his way to the kitchen. He'd brought lemons and mint from the fridge, planning to make the lemonade Ian had complimented before. He needed to care for Ian properly, to show through actions what words couldn't express.
He returned to Ian's office with a tall glass, condensation beading on the sides, the scent of fresh citrus filling the air.
"Lemonade," Jay said, setting it on Ian's desk. "I thought you might need a refreshment."
Ian looked up from his laptop, and something passed between them—a moment of recognition that felt deeper than their usual exchanges. Jay's eyes burned with unmistakable determination to provide care, to be worthy of whatever trust Ian had placed in him.
"Thank you." Ian's voice was quieter than usual. "That's very thoughtful."
Ian's fingers wrapped around the glass, and for a moment neither of them moved. Leo's words echoed in their minds—warnings and suggestions that had stirred a torrent of feelings. Jay saw Ian's nobility and felt compelled to prove himself worthy of it. Ian saw Jay's burning desire to care for him and felt himself drowning in feelings he'd tried so hard to contain.
Scene 4
Tailor
The doubled workload made the rest of the week pass quickly. The remaining team worked twelve-hour days just to keep pace with their expanded responsibilities. Jay arrived at seven each morning and rarely left before eight in the evening, living on coffee and the occasional sandwich grabbed between meetings.
Ian maintained the same gruelling schedule, his office light burning late into the night. They barely spoke beyond the essential exchanges of files and brief status updates, but sometimes, when Jay delivered printed reports to Ian's office, their eyes would meet for a moment longer than necessary. When Ian passed Jay's desk on his way to meetings, there was an awareness between them that hadn't existed before—glances that spoke of thoughts neither dared voice.
Friday brought no relief from the chaos, but at least the promise of weekend rest. As Jay packed his things at the end of another exhausting day, he remembered the Saturday appointment Leo had arranged. The tailor visit had slipped from his mind entirely amid the week's demands.
Jay took a taxi on Saturday afternoon, watching the city change as they headed toward the exclusive district. The buildings grew more imposing, the shop fronts more elegant, the pedestrians more perfectly dressed. By the time they reached the most prestigious tailor in the city, Jay's confidence had evaporated entirely.
The shop's exterior was all polished brass and dark wood, with a discreet gold plaque by the door. Through the windows, Jay could see mahogany fixtures and rows of expensive fabrics. He paid the taxi driver and stood on the pavement for a moment, gathering his courage. 
A silver-haired man in an immaculate suit greeted him at the door. "Mr. Hall, I presume? We've been expecting you."
Jay was led through the showroom to a private fitting area, where two assistants waited with measuring tape and notebooks. No one asked his preferences or opinions. Instead, they moved around him, treating him like a mannequin to be dressed.
"Mr. Turner provided very specific instructions," the head tailor informed him as they began taking measurements. "The cuts should highlight your natural assets. Fitted through the waist and seat to accentuate your figure. He was quite particular about the details."
Jay's face burned as the assistants discussed his body in such detached terms. They spoke about "enhancing his appeal" and "drawing attention to his best features" as if he weren't standing right there, as if he were a product being packaged for display.
"Turn around please. Yes, the trousers should definitely be cut to flatter the posterior. Mr. Turner was very clear about that requirement."
The humiliation was suffocating. Jay stood still as they pinned and marked fabric around him, their comments growing more specific and degrading with each adjustment. It became increasingly clear that these weren't standard business suits being designed—they were meant to make him look attractive, appealing, seductive even.
"This fabric," the assistant held up a swatch of wool. "It will complement his complexion while maintaining the appropriate drape to accentuate the desired areas."
"Perfect. We'll need him back next Saturday for the first fitting, then again the following week for final adjustments." The senior tailor made a note. "Mr. Turner's timeline is aggressive, but manageable."
"Three appointments?" Jay's voice cracked slightly.
"Quality takes time. Though I'm sure someone in your position understands the value of Mr. Turner's patronage."
The master tailor finally gave a curt nod, snapping the notebook shut. “You will return in a week at the same time for another round of fittings. Do try to be more relaxed then.”
The dismissal in his tone was unmistakable. Jay wasn't a customer here—he was a project, a favour being done for someone who actually mattered.
Jay managed to thank them and escape to the street, his hands shaking as he called another taxi. The entire experience had been a brutal reminder of his place in this world. He was Leo's entertainment, a joke hire who'd forgotten his station. Whatever Leo had said about Ian's feelings was clearly part of a game Jay couldn't understand.
The taxi dropped him at his neighbourhood, and Jay walked slowly toward his favourite cafe. The streets he knew so well felt like a balm after the afternoon's humiliation. This was his world—modest buildings, places where he belonged.
"Jay!" Fay's face lit up as he entered. "I haven't seen you in ages. The usual?"
"I'd like hot chocolate with extra marshmallows. Rough day."
"Coming right up." Fay busied herself behind the counter. "You look exhausted. That new job still keeping you busy?"
"Constantly. Twelve-hour days this week with people on holiday." Jay accepted the steaming mug. "But it's good work. Challenging."
"That's wonderful. Though I have to say, it's a shame you stopped coming regularly. This place isn't the same without our best customer."
Jay smiled, feeling some of the afternoon's tension ease. "I'll try to visit more often. I've missed this."
They chatted about the ongoing park construction across the street and the new bakery that had opened down the block. Normal conversation with normal people who treated him like a human being.
"You know what? I promise I'll make time to come here more often," Jay said as he finished his drink. "This is still my favourite place in the city."
"It better be." Fay grinned. "See you soon, Jay."
Walking home through his neighbourhood, Jay felt his equilibrium returning. The uptown world of expensive tailors and condescending staff wasn't his reality. This was—unpretentious cafes and friendly conversations, people who knew his name and were glad to see him.
Leo was a schemer and an imp, exactly as Jay had always known. Whatever game he was playing, it was all manipulation, and Jay wouldn't let it affect his relationship with Ian. Ian was noble, worthy of every bit of respect and gratitude. He remained the best man Jay had ever known, but he was also completely out of Jay's league. The patronage Jay received was simple generosity from a man who believed in helping others, nothing more.
Scene 5
End of August
Max and Luc were back at their desks on Monday, the office finally returning to full capacity. The relief was palpable as the team no longer had to stretch across multiple responsibilities.
"Look who decided to show up on time for once. We were placing bets on whether you'd get stranded in some remote village again," Amy called out.
"Hey, last year wasn't my fault. Besides, I promised I'd be back. Some of us take our commitments seriously," Max protested with a grin.
"And some of us take our holidays seriously too. Tell us everything. Did you finally try that bungee jumping thing?" Ela added.
"No, though I did spend three days hiking through coffee plantations with no cell service. Completely worth the digital detox," Max said.
"Coffee plantations? That sounds amazing," Zoe looked up from her keyboard.
"Best coffee I've ever tasted. The farmers taught me about processing methods I'd never heard of." Max launched into enthusiastic descriptions of volcanic soil and fermentation techniques while the team gathered around his desk.
Meanwhile Luc quietly organized his desk. Jay noticed his colleague's subdued demeanour, the way he deflected personal questions with sharp wit whenever anyone asked about his time away.
"Relationship troubles sorted themselves out then?" Kim asked bluntly.
"Oh absolutely. Turns out two weeks stuck together really clarifies things. Amazing how much clarity you can gain when you're constantly arguing about whose turn it is to do dishes."
"Rough holiday?" Jay asked when he joined Luc for coffee in the kitchen.
"Let's just say some problems follow you regardless of geography. Thanks for keeping everything running smoothly while we were gone. I heard you two practically lived here."
Jay felt heat rise in his cheeks at the implication. "Just covering the necessary work."
With the team complete, the frantic pace of recent weeks finally eased. The late summer heat had also broken, leaving behind pleasant temperatures that made the commute bearable again. Jay could finally leave at normal hours, the freedom feeling strange after months of extended overtime.
Monday evening, he still stayed until eight with Ian as they worked through the backlog together, but on Tuesday, he packed up at five sharp.
"Gym night?" Ian asked as Jay gathered his things.
"Yeah. I think Rus might disown me if I come late again. Will you be alright finishing up alone?"
"Of course. Enjoy your workout."
Jay caught something in Ian's expression, but dismissed it as his imagination. Ian was probably relieved to have time to work without interruption.
At the gym, Rus greeted him with raised eyebrows. "Look who's back at a reasonable hour. Thought you'd been abducted by spreadsheets."
"Close enough. Work's been intense lately."
The session felt different from his recent stress-driven workouts. Without the crushing anxiety about his upcoming trip, without the pressure of covering for absent colleagues, Jay enjoyed the physical challenge. His body had grown stronger during the months of consistent training, and he pushed through his routine with vigour.
On Wednesday evening, he went back to Café Lemon, where Fay greeted him cheerfully. "Second visit within one week? I'm honoured."
He studied the seasonal menu, finally ordering the autumn spice latte that Fay had been recommending since its introduction.
"Feeling adventurous today?" Fay asked as she prepared his drink.
"Thought I'd try something different. Work's been crazy lately, but things are finally calming down." Jay accepted the steaming mug gratefully. "This is exactly what I needed."
The latte was perfect—warming spices balanced with smooth coffee, nothing like the sterile perfection of the office's expensive machine. Jay lingered longer than usual, savouring the simple pleasure of unscheduled time.
On Thursday evening, he went to the local swimming complex. The smell of chlorine brought back memories of awkward teenage lessons and the persistent feeling of not quite belonging anywhere.
The water was cooler than expected, but after a few tentative laps, Jay found his rhythm. His technique was rusty but adequate, and the resistance of the water felt soothing after days of mental strain. Other swimmers moved past him, but no one stared or judged. Here, he was just another person trying to get some exercise.
On Friday, he had his second diving lesson. Jay arrived at the pool centre alone this time, Zoe having her own commitments. Ina greeted him with an encouraging smile.
"Ready to work on your buoyancy control today?"
"As ready as I'll ever be. I've been practising the breathing exercises you showed me."
"Excellent. That's half the battle right there."
The lesson went better than the first. Jay managed to stay relaxed underwater, his movements becoming more natural. When he surfaced after successfully completing the emergency ascent drill, Ina was beaming.
"Three more sessions and you'll be ready for open water. You're doing brilliantly."
As Jay packed up to leave, he felt pride in his progress. The October trip no longer seemed impossible—just challenging.
Each afternoon brought something different from the endless office hours he'd grown accustomed to. Normal things that normal people did—exercise, hobbies, simple pleasures. It felt good to reclaim parts of himself that had been buried under spreadsheets and takeaway containers.
The freedom to get his own life back felt wonderful and lonely in equal measure, and he couldn't shake the feeling that something important was slipping away even as he tried to hold onto himself.
Ian never asked Jay to stay. Never said the work couldn't wait. But leaving the office at reasonable hours meant catching Ian's eye as he packed up, seeing something complicated pass across his boss's features. Jay felt torn between the pull of their shared evenings and the need to maintain work-life balance.
Ian watched Jay leave each evening with mounting dismay he couldn't voice. The return to normal hours was logical, healthy even, but Ian missed their companionship terribly. The empty office felt cold without Jay.
Jay deserved a life beyond these walls, friendships and hobbies and experiences that had nothing to do with work. But knowing it was right didn't make the emptiness any easier to bear. Ian should have been happy for him. Instead, he just wanted him back.
Saturday's second tailor appointment loomed with dread. Jay arrived prepared for condescension this time, which made the experience marginally more bearable. The staff remained dismissive, discussing his measurements and alterations as if he weren't present.
"The adjustments are coming along nicely," the senior tailor announced. "The fit through the seat is particularly flattering. Mr. Turner will be pleased."
Jay endured the fitting in silence, counting minutes until he could escape back to reality. One more session in two weeks, and this ordeal would be finished.
The taxi ride home took him through the transition zones of the city—from manicured lawns back to comfortable authenticity. As his building came into view, Jay felt his shoulders relax. It might not have marble floors or designer furnishings, but it was home. His studio apartment with its large windows and view of the small park felt more valuable than any penthouse.
He climbed the stairs to his flat, breathing deeply as he unlocked his door. The space was modest but bright, filled with books and the accumulated comfort of belonging. This was his world—cafes, swimming pools and gym sessions, places where he was himself and not someone who needed to be dressed appropriately for someone else's purposes.
Whatever Leo was scheming, whatever complicated dynamics existed in the rarefied air of Turner & Associates, Jay could survive them as long as he remembered where he truly belonged. Ian might be the finest man he'd ever known, but their worlds were fundamentally different.
Chapter 23: Fragility
Scene 1
Wounded pride
When September started, the weather turned so perfect it made the city feel like a different place entirely. The oppressive heat of summer had lifted, leaving behind warm sunshine and a fresh breeze that smelled of autumn. Jay walked to work and tried to sort through the tangle of thoughts that had been consuming him since August ended.
He'd spent an entire year molding himself into an acceptable version of Jay Hall—upgrading his wardrobe, learning the language of corporate hierarchy, studying investment terminology in his spare time. All to ensure that the people surrounding him wouldn't find him too displeasing, too obviously out of place.
The tailor appointment had stripped away that veneer, reminding him exactly what he was in their eyes. Not a colleague or even a customer, but a project. The staff's condescension had stung not because it was unexpected, but because it forced him to confront how much of himself he'd been willing to sacrifice for acceptance.
He was a man of humble origins. There was nothing shameful in that. He worked hard, paid his bills, treated people with kindness. What right did anyone have to make him feel lesser for the circumstances of his birth?
He was still the same shy, somewhat insecure man he'd always been. The experiences of the past year had built his confidence in many ways, but they'd also shown him how far he still had to go to truly belong in Ian's world. Maybe that was okay. Maybe he didn't need to belong everywhere as long as he could find places where he fit naturally.
At least in his own neighborhood, people saw him as an equal, not as some charity case who needed to be managed and manipulated. The baristas at Café Lemon didn't look down on him. His neighbors nodded hello without calculating his net worth first.
He arrived at Turner & Associates feeling simultaneously grateful for the opportunity and resentful of the games that seemed to come with it. While Ian remained as considerate and brilliant as ever, Jay approached each day with a new wariness he couldn't quite shake.
At his desk, Jay worked diligently. Every report was flawless, every client interaction smooth. But when five o'clock arrived, he packed his things and left, saying only a polite "Good evening" to Ian as he passed.
"Have a pleasant evening," Ian replied. 
"You too. Don't work too late."
The late summer air beckoned him toward the small park near his apartment. Jay found a bench beneath an oak tree and simply sat, watching office workers hurry past on their way to evening plans. A year ago, he might have felt envious of their obvious belonging in the world. Now he wondered why he'd been so eager to abandon his own place.
On Tuesday, he went to the gym, where Rus welcomed him cheerfully.
"Look who remembers he has muscles. Thought you'd disappeared into some corporate black hole."
They talked between sets, a straightforward interaction Jay enjoyed the most. No hidden agendas, no calculation of words and meanings. Just two people talking about ordinary things.
On Wednesday, he followed the same script—competent work and departure at the stroke of five.
"Leaving at a reasonable hour again?" Amy observed as she gathered her own belongings.
"Trying to enjoy the nice weather while it lasts. I spent so much of the summer buried in work, I forgot what parks looked like in daylight."
Jay spent his evening at Café Lemon, drinking his usual coffee. The pumpkin spice latte had been nice, but today he wanted the comfort of what he liked best. Fay greeted him warmly, asking about his week without any ulterior motive beyond friendly curiosity.
By Thursday, Ian couldn't ignore the pattern any longer. He'd watched Jay's withdrawal with growing unease—the way his assistant's smiles had become more polite than warm, the subtle reserve he maintained during their interactions. Nothing dramatic, but unmistakably different.
"Jay." Ian approached his desk in the afternoon. "How are you finding the return to normal hours?"
"Very pleasant, thank you. It's good to have some time for personal activities again."
"Of course. The weather's been lovely for outdoor pursuits."
"It has." Jay continued organizing his desk, not meeting Ian's eyes. "I've been taking walks in the parks. I haven't had much chance to do that lately."
The explanation was reasonable, but Ian caught something guarded in Jay's tone. "Is everything alright? You seem a bit... quiet lately."
"Nothing's wrong." Jay's smile appeared and disappeared quickly. "Just enjoying the nice weather while it lasts."
Ian nodded, recognizing the deflection for what it was. Jay wasn't lying, but he wasn't telling the complete truth either. Something had changed, something that went deeper than seasonal shifts or workload adjustments.
Ian watched him leave that day and felt his stomach twist. He wanted to be the person Jay felt comfortable confiding in, wanted to help with whatever was troubling him. The defenses he'd so carefully maintained now felt like prison walls, keeping him from reaching the person he cared about more than was wise.
On Thursday evening, Jay was at the swimming pool again, moving through laps. The repetitive motion cleared his mind. Here, surrounded by the democratic equalizer of chlorinated water, everyone was just another body seeking exercise.
An elderly man in the next lane gave a friendly nod as they reached the wall simultaneously. "Nice technique. You've been swimming long?"
"Not really. Just getting back into it." Jay pulled himself up to sit on the pool edge. "I forgot how good it feels."
"Best medicine there is. Washes away all the day's nonsense."
Jay smiled. No one here cared about his background or his suitability for their social circles.
Friday brought Jay's third diving lesson, and Ina's praise for his improving buoyancy control felt more meaningful than any corporate commendation. When she scheduled his final sessions for the following weeks, Jay felt excitement about the October trip.
Ian watched these changes from his office, the way Jay seemed to be retreating into himself despite maintaining outward politeness.
He wanted to ask what had happened, what had caused this sudden chill to appear between them. But what right did he have to pry into Jay's personal emotional landscape? If Jay chose to reclaim his evenings, if he preferred parks and cafes to his company, that was not only his right, that was the best course of action.
Yet Ian felt the loss acutely. The empty office hours stretched longer. He'd grown dependent on those stolen moments of companionship, and now they were gone as suddenly as they'd appeared.
Late Friday evening, long after Jay had left for his diving lesson, Ian sat alone in his office in growing darkness. He missed Jay desperately. The distance Jay maintained now felt like a rebuke, though Ian couldn't identify what he'd done to deserve it.
Meanwhile, Jay walked home through the gathering dusk. The streets were welcoming, filled with people who belonged to his world. 
He thought about Ina's encouragement, about the elderly swimmer, about Fay. These people saw him as he was and found him acceptable. He didn't need to change himself for their approval or worry about measuring up to impossible standards.
Scene 2
Confusion
Luc's absence caused an unexpected disruption. His desk remained empty as the team filtered in on Monday, and it wasn't until Ian called the morning meeting that they learned he'd requested sudden sick leave for the entire week.
"Is he alright? He looked pretty rough last week," Amy asked.
"The request was brief. We should respect his privacy while ensuring his responsibilities are covered," Ian replied.
Jay felt a twist of worry in his stomach. Luc had been subdued since his return from holiday, deflecting personal questions. The curt dismissals, the hollow smiles—Jay recognized the signs that he was struggling beneath the surface.
During his lunch break, Jay sent a text: "Hope you're feeling better soon. Let me know if there's anything I can do to help."
The reply came back within minutes: "Fine. Just need rest. Thanks."
The brevity felt like a door slamming shut, but Jay couldn't shake his concern.
"I can stay late to handle Luc's backlog," Jay offered during the afternoon team meeting. "Most of his projects overlap with things I've worked on before."
"That's not necessary. You've already covered more than your share during the summer months. I can manage the overflow," Ian said, but his expression was complicated.
"I really don't mind. The workload isn't that heavy, and I know his client files."
"If you're certain you don't mind the extra hours."
"I'm certain."
That evening, Jay was back at working late alongside Ian. But something felt different—a tension in the air that hadn't existed during their summer overtime sessions. Ian seemed more closed off, the comfort of their shared work replaced by polite formality.
Jay tried to dismiss it as his own changed perspective. Perhaps he'd been reading too much into their previous interactions, imagining intimacy where only courtesy existed. But when he glanced down at the watch on his wrist, the weight of it felt real and meaningful. Too expensive, too personal to be a mere gesture.
On Tuesday, Luc gave another curt reply when Jay checked in again: "Still resting. Don't need anything."
The dismissal stung a bit. Jay went to the gym that evening, pushing himself through an aggressive workout that left him exhausted but no less worried about his colleague.
"You're distracted tonight," Rus observed as Jay nearly dropped a weight. "Work problems?"
"Colleague problems. Someone's going through a rough patch and won't accept help."
"Some people have to hit bottom before they'll reach out. All you can do is be there when they're ready."
The rest of the week continued in the same strained pattern. Jay stayed late Wednesday and Thursday, working through Luc's client files. The atmosphere was tense, and Jay worried—about Luc, about the tension between him and Ian.
By Friday, Jay had rescheduled his diving lesson to stay late again, though they were largely caught up with the backlog. As the office emptied around them, he made a decision that felt both necessary and terrifying.
"Ian?" Jay appeared in the doorway of Ian's office, his heart beating faster than the situation warranted. "Could I speak with you for a moment?"
Ian looked up from his laptop. "Of course."
Jay closed the door behind him and took the chair across from Ian's desk. "Is something wrong? This week has felt... different."
"I could ask you the same question."
Jay managed a half-smile that felt more like a grimace. "Nothing's wrong."
"It's not true, is it. I don't want to pry, truly I don't, but recently you've been..." He trailed off, then forced himself to continue. "Did I do something to displease you?"
Heat rushed to Jay's face so quickly he felt dizzy. "Of course not. You never—you've never done anything of the sort."
"Then what is it? You've been different since the beginning of the month. I know it's not my place to ask, but—"
"I had a rough weekend." Jay's words came out in a rush, cutting off Ian's probing. "Some unpleasant experiences that left me feeling unsettled. The feeling's been lingering, but it's nothing serious. Nothing to do with you or work."
He tried to inject some lightness into the heavy atmosphere, but Ian's expression didn't change. The concern in his eyes remained, along with something that looked almost like hurt.
"I see. I'm sorry you've been dealing with something difficult."
"It's really nothing dramatic. Just... reminded me of some things about my place in the world, I suppose. Made me more cautious."
The words were loaded with meanings Jay wasn't ready to explain and Ian wasn't in a position to probe. Jay touched his watch unconsciously, drawing comfort from its weight.
"If there's anything I can do to help—"
"There isn't. But thank you for asking. And for caring enough to notice."
Ian studied Jay's face for a long moment, and Jay had the uncomfortable feeling that his boss could see right through his explanations to the wounded pride and confusion beneath.
"You know I want you to feel comfortable here. Safe."
"I do feel safe." The words were true, even if they weren't complete. "You've created the best work environment I've ever experienced. Whatever I'm dealing with has nothing to do with that."
Ian nodded slowly, but the heaviness around him didn't lift. If anything, he looked more troubled than before, as if Jay's reassurances had only confirmed his worst fears.
They returned to work in silence, but the tension remained. The camaraderie of their previous overtime sessions felt like a memory from another life, replaced by performed civility that felt somehow worse than outright coldness.
As they prepared to leave, Jay felt the weight of everything unsaid pressing down on him, but he couldn't explain the full truth without revealing Leo's manipulations and his own growing confusion.
"I hope Luc will be feeling better by Monday."
"Me too."
The lift arrived, and they descended in silence. But as they parted ways in the lobby, Jay caught Ian watching him with that same worried expression, as if he were afraid Jay might disappear if he looked away.
Scene 3
Unspoken things
Jay was at the gym on Saturday, pushing through his routine while his mind churned over the previous week's tensions. Rus immediately spotted the distracted way Jay approached each exercise.
"You're lifting like your head's somewhere else entirely. Work troubles again?"
"Yeah. Can I ask you something? About work situations?"
"Shoot."
"Things got awkward with my boss recently, and I can't figure out how to fix it. We used to work well together, but now everything feels strained."
"Best advice? Stay as far away from your boss as possible. Nothing good comes from getting too close to the person who signs your paychecks."
"Right. That makes sense."
Under normal circumstances, Jay would have agreed completely. It was sound advice, wisdom that kept careers intact. But with Ian, everything felt different. The relationship they'd built—how could he explain that to someone who'd never experienced it?
Rus's casual dismissal only added another weight to Jay's growing collection of worries. If everyone else saw fraternising with a boss as inherently problematic, what did that say about the bond he and Ian had shared during those long evening hours?
Even by his own standards, getting close to a supervisor was foolish. How had it happened that he felt so connected to Ian? When had respect turned into something so much deeper?
The weekend passed on preparations and anxious thoughts. The final tailor appointment was scheduled for the afternoon, but this time Jay's mind was elsewhere. The staff remained condescending, but their words barely registered. His thoughts were consumed by the heavy atmosphere between him and Ian, the frigid politeness that felt worse than outright conflict.
How had Ian even noticed something was wrong? Jay had done his best to maintain composure, to ensure his personal crisis didn't affect their working relationship. Was Ian truly that perceptive, or was Jay more transparent than he realized?
Sunday brought his second-to-last diving lesson. Ina praised his progress, noting how much more confident he'd become underwater, but even her encouragement couldn't lift Jay's mood completely.
"One more session and you'll be ready for open water," she said as Jay surfaced from a successful emergency ascent drill. "You've come so far since that first nervous lesson."
"Thanks to your patience," Jay replied, but the praise felt distant. Everything felt distant lately, as if he were experiencing life through a fog of confusion and worry.
Only one lesson remained, and then he'd be ready for his October adventure. The trip that had once terrified him now felt like a welcome escape from the tension that seemed to follow him everywhere.
Luc returned on Monday, but the relief was short-lived. Their colleague looked terrible—pale, drawn, with dark circles under his eyes that spoke of sleepless nights and ongoing struggles. He sat at his desk, deflecting concerned inquiries with curt nods and forced smiles.
Jay waited until mid-morning before intercepting Luc in the kitchen, timing his approach when they were alone.
"Good to have you back. How are you feeling?"
"Better. Thanks." Luc's response was strained.
"Listen, I know you probably don't want to talk, but if you need a shoulder to cry on, I'm available. I know a place that serves the best hot chocolate in the city."
For a moment, Luc smiled. Jay remembered how Luc had taken him to that same café after his mistake with the deadline, offering comfort without judgment when Jay had needed it most.
"Thanks, Jay. I appreciate it. Maybe soon."
Later that morning, Zoe stopped by Jay's desk.
"How's the apartment hunting going? Last time we talked, you had several viewings lined up for this month."
Jay realized he hadn't thought about moving in weeks. The list of potential flats, the excitement about finding a better place—all of it had been pushed aside by recent events.
"I'm postponing it until November. Things are a bit chaotic right now with the upcoming trip and everything. Better to wait until things calm down."
"Fair enough. The market isn't going anywhere."
The idea of uprooting himself, of changing another fundamental aspect of his life when everything already felt uncertain, seemed overwhelming. His current studio might not be perfect, but it was home, safe when little else felt stable.
The week crawled by under a cloud of strained politeness. Jay and Ian were particular about their interactions, each exchange feeling simultaneously normal and completely wrong. They were both trying so hard to act naturally that every conversation became stilted.
Jay couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss, but he couldn't identify what or how to fix it. Ian seemed equally aware of the tension, his tone more formal than usual, his expressions guarded as if they were in Jay's first weeks at the company.
The weather remained beautiful—warm September days that should have lifted everyone's spirits—but the morale didn't improve. Luc's obvious distress cast a pall over the team, creating an atmosphere that Jay couldn't remember experiencing before at Turner & Associates.
Wednesday evening, Jay stayed late again to help catch up on work. They worked in silence, maintaining polite distance.
"How are the trip preparations coming along?" Ian asked during a brief break.
"Well, I think. The diving lessons are almost complete, and I have all the documentation sorted. The business trip should help with the whole international travel anxiety."
"I'm glad it will be useful." Ian's response was measured, appropriate, and completely lacking the warmth that had characterized their previous conversations.
Jay wanted to ask what had changed, wanted to bridge the gap that seemed to be widening between them despite their best efforts to pretend everything was normal. But how could he address a problem neither of them could properly define?
Ian, meanwhile, fought a losing battle against his own spiraling thoughts. He was terrified that his worst fears were coming true. Somehow, Jay had realized the depth of Ian's feelings and was trying to extricate himself from an uncomfortable situation.
He was ultra-proper, ultra-mindful, scared that one wrong move would send Jay fleeing entirely. If Jay felt unsafe, Ian would never forgive himself.
Friday arrived with no improvement in the strange tension. As Jay prepared to leave at the end of the day, he caught Ian watching him with an expression that looked almost like grief.
"Have a good weekend," Ian said.
"You too. Try not to work too late."
It was the same exchange they'd had dozens of times before, but it felt like a goodbye to something precious that was slipping away. Jay left the office feeling as if he'd lost something important without understanding what or how.
All because a tailor had been rude, because Leo had planted seeds of doubt, because Jay's wounded pride had made him retreat just enough to trigger Ian's deepest fears about wanting too much.
Scene 4
Sleepover
Jay was finishing his dinner when his phone buzzed with an unexpected message: "Can you come over? Could use the company. Sorry for short notice."
He stared at the text from Luc for only a moment before typing back: "Of course. Send me your address."
Jay had changed into his last pair of jeans and a t-shirt, stopped at the liquor store for the most expensive whiskey they had, and within an hour was standing outside an impressive building in the financial district. Luc had mentioned before where he lived, but seeing it in person was different—all glass and steel and elegance that screamed wealth.
Luc answered the door with red-rimmed eyes and a pitiful expression.
"You brought the good stuff. Come in. Fair warning—the place is ridiculous."
The apartment was indeed ridiculous. Huge windows with a spectacular view of the city, and the living room alone was larger than Jay's entire studio. Everything was sleek and modern, from the leather furniture to the abstract art on the walls.
"Four of us split this place," Luc explained, noticing Jay's wide-eyed expression. "The rent is absolutely obscene, but we all love playing successful yuppies. My roommates cleared out for the weekend—couldn't handle my brooding anymore."
They sat on the massive sectional sofa, Luc immediately pouring generous measures of whiskey into two glasses. Jay accepted his reluctantly, still not over how much he hated the burning sensation of alcohol.
"So," Luc said after draining half his glass in one go. "Cam dumped me."
Jay had seen the signs all week—the forced smiles, the way Luc had deflected every concerned inquiry.
"I'm sorry. That's awful."
"Is it though?" Luc laughed bitterly, already reaching for the bottle again. "I saw it coming. We'd been arguing for months about everything—my career, where we wanted to live. Eight years together, Jay. My entire adult life since university. The only real relationship I've ever had that lasted more than three months."
Jay sipped his whiskey and tried not to wince at the taste. "Eight years is a long time. Of course it hurts, even if you knew it was coming."
"She wanted marriage, kids. And I kept making excuses, putting her off, because I knew I wasn't ready. Maybe I'll never be ready for that kind of commitment. But she was tired of waiting for me to grow up."
"You weren't wrong to wait if you weren't ready. Forcing it would have made both of you miserable."
"Would it? Or am I just selfish and immature like she said?" Tears were gathering in Luc's eyes now. "Maybe I am just a shallow playboy who's afraid of real responsibility."
"That's not true. You're one of the most dedicated people I know. You work hard, you're loyal to your friends, you're kind and thoughtful. Being uncertain about marriage doesn't make you selfish."
Luc broke down then, shoulders shaking as he sobbed into his hands. Jay moved closer, offering the support he'd wished for during his own dark moments. They sat together while Luc grieved, the whiskey disappearing from the bottle.
"You probably never got dumped," Luc said eventually, his words slightly slurred. "You're so proper and serious, probably had girls queuing up for the privilege of dating someone so together."
Jay nearly choked on his whiskey. "Not at all. I was very much dumped, called boring and disappointing too."
Luc's eyes widened with horror. "That's awful! What kind of person would say that? They had no idea what they had."
The memory still stung after all these years—a girl from college, older and supposedly more experienced, who'd approached him with such confidence and charm. She'd made him feel special, chosen, until the night she'd told him that he was uninspiring in bed and that she needed someone with more passion.
"It was in college. A girl who thought she could teach me things. Turns out I was a poor student." Jay took another sip of whiskey, the alcohol making the confession easier.
"Jay." Luc's voice was full of sympathy. "That's terrible."
"I never tried again after that. Seemed safer to focus on other things."
They spent the evening trading stories of disasters and anxieties, the whiskey making everything feel both more profound and more manageable. When Jay finally looked at his watch, it was past midnight.
"I should probably head home," he said, starting to stand.
"Don't go." Luc caught his arm, desperation bleeding through the alcohol. "Please. I don't want to be alone with my thoughts tonight."
"Alright. I'll take the couch."
The sectional was more comfortable than Jay's own bed. It was, he realized with some amusement, his first ever sleepover—a milestone at thirty that seemed both pathetic and charming.
Morning arrived with harsh sunlight and the sound of Luc moving around the kitchen. Jay found him attempting to make scrambled eggs, his movements clumsy and his face pale with hangover.
"I think I'm dying," Luc announced dramatically. "But I'm making breakfast as penance for keeping you here all night."
The eggs were terrible, overcooked and underseasoned, with a rubbery texture that defied explanation.
"Now I finally understand why you got dumped," Jay said with a straight face.
For a moment, Luc looked stricken, and Jay wondered if he'd pushed too far too soon. Then Luc burst into laughter, the first trace of humor Jay had seen from him in weeks.
"That was cruel. Accurate, but cruel."
They sat at the ridiculous marble breakfast bar, picking at the inedible eggs and drinking coffee that was thankfully much better than the food.
"You know, this doesn't mean there's something wrong with you. Sometimes people just aren't compatible, no matter how much they care about each other. You'll find someone who wants the same things you do."
"Maybe. Right now I just want to not feel like my entire life just exploded." Luc managed a weak smile. "Thanks for staying, Jay. I know it's not exactly how you wanted to spend your Friday night."
"There's nowhere I'd rather have been," Jay said simply, and meant it.
He left before noon, declining Luc's offer of actual breakfast from a nearby café, and headed to the gym for a late session. Rus took one look at him and grinned.
"Someone had a fun night."
"I was out drinking with a friend who needed support."
"Good. I'm glad you actually have friends after all. Was starting to worry you were a complete hermit."
Jay felt lighter as he worked through his routine, glad he'd been able to help Luc through the worst of his crisis. At least one problem in his life had a clear solution, since someone like Luc, charming, successful, good-hearted, would definitely find happiness again.
It was one less thing to worry about in a month that had been full of complications. The awkward tension with Ian remained unresolved, but at least Luc would be alright.
Scene 5
Getting ready
Luc's condition showed visible improvement when Jay saw him at work on Monday. The red-rimmed eyes were gone, replaced by a determined expression. Jay found him at the coffee machine during the morning break, looking more like his old self.
"How are you holding up?" 
"Better. Marginally. Still feels like someone rearranged my internal organs, but better. Thanks again for Friday night. I needed that. Sorry about the eggs."
"They were memorably terrible. Look at it this way—at least now you can stay overtime as much as you want with no one nagging you about work-life balance. Silver linings."
"You're absolutely heartless."
"I'm learning. Give me another breakup or two and I'll be a proper shoulder to cry on."
Despite the joke falling flat, Luc smiled. "I need to get myself together. My roommates are already making pointed comments about my brooding affecting the apartment's vibe. If I don't snap out of it soon, they'll throw me out."
"Saving ten thousand on rent? However would you survive such a tragedy?"
"Now you sound just like Cam," Luc laughed.
The rest of the team seemed to sense that Jay's upcoming international trip was a milestone. Throughout the week, they offered advice with varying degrees of usefulness.
Kim was the most vocal about technical concerns. "Make sure your phone plan includes international data. The roaming charges will bankrupt you otherwise. And get a universal adapter—their plugs are completely different."
Max's advice was ridiculous. "Pack an extra suit in your carry-on in case they lose your luggage. Also, always tip the hotel concierge immediately. They remember faces, and you want to be memorable for the right reasons."
Amy was more pragmatic. "Don't drink the tap water anywhere. Even in developed countries. Trust me on this. And remember their business culture is more casual than ours."
Ela was all about sightseeing opportunities. "Make sure you get some time to enjoy the city. All work and no play makes for boring travel stories."
Even Zoe chimed in, though her wilderness-focused travel experience was less relevant. "I've never been to the New Continent cities, but I've heard their public transport is absolutely terrible. Just use taxis for everything—it's worth the expense not to get stranded somewhere."
Only Luc remained mostly quiet at his desk, still working through his emotional recovery, but Jay appreciated the team's collective concern.
Jay retrieved his suits from the tailoring house on Wednesday, a moment he had been dreading. He arrived at the appointed time, steeling himself for another round of condescending treatment.
The receptionist directed him to a private fitting room where his completed garments hung in perfect alignment, each covered with protective cloth bags bearing the shop's discreet logo. The senior tailor appeared with an assistant. 
"Mr. Hall. Your completed wardrobe."
They were three-piece suits—something Jay had never owned before. The charcoal gray was conservative and elegant, perfect for serious business meetings. The dark blue struck a balance between authority and approachability. But it was the burgundy that surprised him most—bolder than anything he'd ever owned, yet somehow still tasteful. The added waistcoats lent each ensemble a formality that felt unusual to him, heavier, more deliberate, as if the garments belonged to a different class of man.
Each suit fit perfectly. The staff remained as condescending as ever, but Jay barely noticed their attitude. He was too busy marvelling at how the expensive fabric felt.
"Everything meets with your approval?" the senior tailor asked, though his tone made it clear he couldn't care less about Jay's opinion.
"They're beautiful. Thank you."
Along with the suits came matching shirts, silk ties, leather shoes, protective garment bags, and a massive and very elegant suitcase. Everything charged to the company account, naturally.
Jay left with his arms full of expensive clothing and his distrust of Leo deeper than ever. The suits were gorgeous, but the motivation behind them remained suspect, and Jay couldn't shake the feeling that he was being prepared for purposes beyond simple presentation.
Jay returned home and began packing. He laid everything out on his bed—the new suits, his designer outfit from the company dinner, a more casual selection that might be appropriate for downtime. The massive suitcase could accommodate everything with room to spare, but his closet couldn't handle the storage implications. 
Thursday morning, Jay didn't go to the office to prepare for their afternoon departure. His appointment with the celebrity hairstylist Leo had arranged was scheduled for nine. The salon had a minimalist design and hushed atmosphere screaming exclusivity, but the stylist himself was surprisingly warm.
"Excellent bone structure. We'll enhance what you have naturally," he murmured, running fingers through Jay's hair.
The result was remarkable. The cut was flattering Jay's features while maintaining an air of elegance. It required minimal maintenance, but looked like he'd stepped out of a magazine.
Back home, Jay dressed in the burgundy suit, the one he had deemed most flattering. The deep wine colour was bolder than anything in his wardrobe, but the overall effect remained appropriate. The three-piece design made him look older, more established, like someone who belonged in first-class lounges.
Ian's watch sat at his wrist, now complemented by the expensive clothing. Jay caught sight of himself in his bathroom mirror and barely recognized the reflection. He could represent the company internationally without embarrassment.
On impulse, Jay took out his phone and attempted a selfie. His photography skills were generally terrible, but somehow the lighting and angle worked. The image showed a handsome young man with kind eyes and a slight smile.
He posted it to the social media account Ema had insisted he create, adding the caption: "First business trip". His family was the only audience, so sharing didn't feel inappropriate.
The phone rang almost immediately and Ema's excited voice practically vibrated through the speaker.
"Oh my God, Jay! You look amazing! Is that a new suit? It's gorgeous! Where are you going? Are there going to be other rich people? You have to take tons of photos!"
"It's just a business meeting. Nothing too exciting."
"Nothing exciting? You look like a movie star! Mom's going to die when she sees this. Are you flying first class? What's the hotel like? Is your boss taking you somewhere fancy?"
"Yes, Ian's coming with me."
"The Ian you never talk about but clearly worship? This is so exciting! You're living like a proper businessman now!"
Jay laughed despite his mixed feelings about that description. "I should go. Need to finish packing."
"Take pictures of everything! The plane, the hotel, the food, the meeting—I want to live vicariously through your glamorous life!"
By eleven, he was ready—suitcase packed, documents organized, appearance immaculate. Soon Ian would arrive in the company car to collect him, and they'd begin this journey together—their first extended period alone together. Jay was as prepared as he could possibly be. 
Chapter 24: Business trip
Scene 1
Departure
Jay descended the stairs of his building at ten minutes to twelve, his nerves making him leave early. The sleek black limousine pulled up exactly one minute later.
The driver immediately stepped out to handle Jay's luggage. "Mr. Hall? I'll take care of this for you."
Ian was seated inside, impeccably dressed in a charcoal gray suit. He looked up from his phone as Jay got in.
"Good morning, Jay. I trust you slept well?"
"Yes, thank you." Jay smoothed down his three-piece suit, feeling self conscious about the formal cut. "The timing worked out perfectly."
"The new suit is quite elegant. Very appropriate for our meetings."
Jay felt heat rise in his cheeks. "Leo arranged it. Along with the others."
Ian's expression immediately sharpened, concern replacing politeness. "Leo arranged your clothing? Did he... say anything to you?"
Jay was quiet for a moment, looking out the window at the city passing by. "He did say things, but if I'm being honest, I don't trust a word that comes from Leo's mouth."
Unexpectedly, Ian laughed. "I don't blame you. It's probably the most prudent choice. Though I should mention that Leo isn't a bad person, despite appearances. He has a rather playful personality and can be insufferable, but I do trust him." 
"I don't. And I'm unlikely to change my mind about that."
"Did he say something to upset you?"
"Not exactly. He was just being ridiculous, as always. He probably set up that fancy tailor appointment only to humiliate me."
"Was the arrangement unpleasant?"
Jay chose his words carefully. "The staff was... diplomatically speaking, rude."
"Which tailor did he send you to?"
"Saviour & Sons."
"No wonder. That's the poshest establishment in the city, but also the most patronizing place you could possibly visit."
"I bet they definitely wouldn't be rude to you though."
"Actually, they would. I'm banned there." 
 "What?"
"You need to understand something about me, Jay. I'm a pariah in high society. After my scandal, places like Saviour & Sons outright refuse to serve me."
Jay was horrified. "If I'd known that, I never would have gone there. Why would Leo send me somewhere that treated you that way?"
"Leo comes from old money—born and raised with a silver spoon. He's unaware of such details. Based on how he's treated there, he probably wouldn't think anyone could have a bad experience. He definitely wasn't being malicious."
"I can't think of any other reason I'd need such expensive suits."
Ian laughed again, and Jay was struck by how much lighter he seemed when his guard was down. "You're Leo's first successful hire. He's making sure his head-hunting skills are properly appreciated by gearing you up appropriately. He'll probably spend the next decade telling me 'I told you so' about needing a proper assistant."
Jay remained unconvinced, but Ian's openness about his past felt significant. His own bad experience suddenly seemed smaller in comparison. He had always thought of himself as uniquely outside the society where he now worked, but apparently Ian didn't have such a good relationship with it either.
"When I lost everything, Leo was the only person who helped me. We've been friends since university, and while his personality can be insufferable, he isn't malicious. He just meddles too much. You can safely disregard anything he says."
"I still hold him responsible for the tailor experience. And if they dared to shun you, I'm doubly displeased with them."
"They did excellent work though," Ian said, his gaze lingering on Jay's appearance before he caught himself and looked away.
Jay felt his cheeks warm again. Ian seemed to notice his discomfort and quickly changed direction.
"Don't let the rude tailors bother you. They're known for being unpleasant and hardly represent anything meaningful. But I'll be sure to give Leo a proper scolding for subjecting you to that experience."
"I'd rather Leo simply kept his distance from me. But I understand that's impossible, since he's practically the boss of the company."
The reminder of the hierarchy, of his position at the bottom of the corporate ladder, made Jay's shoulders tense. He'd have to keep his head down and endure Leo's meddling if he wanted to survive at Turner & Associates.
Ian noticed the change immediately, his expression growing concerned, but before he could respond, Jay's phone rang. Jay looked flustered as he glanced at the caller ID.
"Go ahead, don't mind me," Ian said.
"Hello?"
"Jay!" It wasn't Ema's voice this time, but a younger boy's excited chatter. "Ema told us you're going to another country! Can you send us a postcard? And maybe bring some candy? Or a toy?"
"Ari, this is a business trip. I won't have time to shop around—"
"Please? Ema says rich people always bring presents when they travel!"
Jay could hear Ema's voice in the background, clearly encouraging her youngest brother. "I'll try, but I can't promise anything."
"You're the best brother ever! Ema wants to talk to you again—"
The phone was clearly passed back and forth while his siblings competed for his attention, and Jay smiled despite his embarrassment at the public display.
Ian watched the interaction with obvious amusement. When Jay finally ended the call, looking mortified, Ian was smiling.
"I'll make sure we have Saturday afternoon free for shopping. Consider it compensation for the tailor visit. I'll ensure you have a much better retail experience."
"You don't have to do that—"
"I insist." Ian's tone brooked no argument. "It's nice that you have such a good relationship with your family. You should treasure it."
Jay's expression grew wistful. "Actually, we were never really close. Too far apart in age—I grew up in completely different circumstances than them. I left home as soon as I could to escape the noise of three little children. They're only nice to me now because they can extort gifts."
Ian laughed, seeing right through Jay's facade. "You don't look like you mind being badgered for presents."
"You're probably right. They are good kids."
Soon they arrived at their destination. The airport was a maze of terminals and security checkpoints, but Ian moved through it without trouble. He guided Jay through check-in, explained the security procedures, and showed him how to find their gate.
"The business lounge is through there if you ever need a space to work," Ian said, pointing down a corridor. "And that shop carries decent travel essentials if you forget anything."
They still had time before their flight, so Ian proposed they go to one of the terminal cafes. As they sat at a small table with coffee, Jay realized the awkwardness between them had largely dissolved. The change of scenery seemed to have helped, allowing them to interact more naturally than they had in weeks.
"Thank you for being so patient with all this. I know it must seem ridiculous that someone my age has never flown before."
"Everyone has a first time. There's nothing ridiculous about it."
As they talked, Jay watched Ian with new eyes. The revelation about his social exile, his status as a reject from the world Jay had assumed he belonged to, changed everything. To Jay, Ian was the absolute pinnacle of grace and competence. If someone like Ian could be cast out by high society, then perhaps the problem wasn't with the individual but with the society itself.
The high society must be blind as well as stupid, Jay thought, watching Ian explain airline protocols.
Scene 2
Plane flight
Boarding went more smoothly than Jay had thought. Ian guided him through the process, handling their carry-on luggage and directing Jay to their seats. Their business class seats were more spacious than Jay had imagined, arranged in pairs with generous legroom and privacy screens. Ian gestured toward the window seat.
"I prefer the aisle," he said, though in truth he had no particular preference. He simply wanted to watch Jay's reactions to his first flight experience.
Jay felt slightly sheepish about his obvious inexperience. "Are you sure? I don't want to inconvenience you."
"Not at all. Please, make yourself comfortable."
Jay marveled at the amenities around them—the adjustable lighting, the individual entertainment systems, the blankets already waiting for them. Everything was elegant and foreign.
The takeoff was surprisingly gentle, nothing like the dramatic lurching Jay had braced himself for. The powerful engines created a thrum as they lifted off. Jay wasn't particularly afraid of heights,  and he was mesmerized by the ground falling away below them. The city became a patchwork of lights and geometric patterns, then clouds obscured everything in white cotton.
"This is incredible," Jay murmured, his face pressed to the small window.
Ian smiled, watching Jay's wonder. "Different than you expected?"
"Completely. I thought it would be more... violent, I suppose. This is almost peaceful."
The flight attendants served lunch after they reached cruising altitude, and Jay realized how hungry he'd become in his morning nervousness. The food was surprisingly good—far better than he had expected from airline cuisine, and he ate with appreciation while continuing to peer out at the landscape passing far below.
After lunch, Jay made himself comfortable, glancing occasionally at Ian who had pulled out his tablet to read business publications. Jay had downloaded movies to his laptop and packed both a book and a magazine for the eight-hour journey, but for now he was content to watch the changing scenery outside.
"Enjoying the view?" Ian asked after they'd been airborne for an hour.
"Very much. It's amazing how smooth this whole experience has been." Jay turned from the window to meet Ian's eyes. "Though I suppose I shouldn't be surprised—having you here makes everything better."
He hadn't meant to voice that last thought quite so directly, and immediately felt exposed. He felt heat rise in his cheeks as he realized what he'd admitted, but Ian's expression only grew warmer.
"I'm glad I can help ease the experience."
As Ian returned to his tablet, Jay looked at him with a gaze that held both admiration and a sense of inferiority. He couldn't allow himself to forget his place again. No matter how Ian had been treated by high society, that was still his world. Jay was just passing through, pulled briefly into Ian's orbit by a twist of fate. His place beside Ian was temporary, borrowed, precarious, and he shouldn't make himself too comfortable.
But the yearning was there regardless—to bask in Ian's glow, to allow himself just a bit of indulgence in this fantasy of belonging.
The complicated thoughts must have shown on his face, because Ian looked up with concern.
"Everything alright? You're not feeling nauseous, are you? Some people find the altitude unsettling."
"I'm fine. Maybe the altitude is making me a bit dizzy," Jay said, though he looked somehow sad.
Ian felt a pull to reach out, to gather Jay into his arms and soothe whatever was troubling him. The urge was becoming increasingly difficult to resist, but he knew he couldn't act on it. He would ruin everything, scare Jay away, and lose him forever. 
To break the spell, Ian reached for his laptop. "Perhaps we should watch a movie. Something light to pass the time."
He pulled out two pairs of headphones and selected a well-reviewed comedy, but after twenty minutes he noticed Jay wasn't really watching. His attention kept drifting back to the window, his expression melancholy. Gradually, Jay's eyes grew heavy, and he dozed off against the seat cushion.
Ian wanted to wake him—sleeping too much during the flight would make the jetlag worse—but Jay looked so peaceful that Ian couldn't bring himself to disturb him. Instead, he turned off the movie and watched Jay sleep, memorizing the lines of his face in repose.
Jay woke after two hours, groggy and disoriented. He checked his watch and realized they were halfway through the flight. Ian was reading on his tablet again, the laptop put away. Jay blinked slowly, trying to clear the fog from his mind.
"Sorry for drifting off," he mumbled.
"It's perfectly fine. Would you like some coffee? Or water?"
The flight attendant brought coffee at Ian's request, and the caffeine helped Jay feel marginally more alert, though he remained subdued.
"You shouldn't sleep too much more, or tonight will be rough with the time difference. Perhaps we should try a more energetic film?"
"I'm finding it hard to focus on anything," Jay admitted.
Ian set aside his tablet and turned his attention fully to Jay. "Tell me, what do you know about New Continent customs? I thought I might share some observations about what to expect."
For the remainder of the flight, Ian kept up a stream of conversation—stories about local traditions, business etiquette, amusing cultural differences he'd encountered in previous visits. Jay listened, asking occasional questions, but Ian could see the fatigue weighing on him.
By the time they landed, Jay felt thoroughly drained. Eight hours was the longest he'd ever spent in any vehicle, and despite the comfortable seats, his body felt stiff and sluggish. A driver met them at customs, handling their luggage and guiding them to a waiting car.
The drive to the hotel was uneventful. It was five in the afternoon local time, but Jay's body insisted it was eleven at night back home, and he felt increasingly sleepy with each passing mile.
The hotel was magnificent, a five-star establishment with elegant furnishigs. Their rooms were adjacent, spacious and beautifully appointed. Jay unpacked, fighting the urge to simply collapse onto the inviting bed despite the hunger gnawing at his stomach.
Ian knocked on his door at five-thirty local time.
"Dinner. I know you're tired, but trust me on this. We need to get you on local time as quickly as possible."
"I could just order room service—"
"Absolutely not. Proper dinner downstairs, and no sleeping until at least eight o'clock."
They ate in the hotel's restaurant, Ian maintaining light conversation while Jay struggled with his exhaustion. The food was excellent, but Jay could barely focus on it. Ian could see how hard the travel was hitting him, but he kept Jay downstairs until seven-thirty, ensuring he'd have a better chance of sleeping through the night.
Finally, Ian relented. "You should get some rest now. Tomorrow will be a long day. Set an alarm for morning. We have meetings at ten. I'll meet you for breakfast at seven."
Jay practically stumbled back to his room. He laid out his clothes for the following day, took a quick shower, and fell into bed almost immediately. It was two in the morning back home—later than he'd ever stayed awake in his adult life. The comfortable hotel bed embraced him like a cloud, and he was asleep within minutes.
Scene 3
Business meetings and late night drinks
Jay woke with a start at five in the morning, the remnants of a dream clinging to his consciousness—Ian's arms around him, warmth and safety that felt achingly real until consciousness intruded. He lay still for a moment, disoriented by both the unfamiliar surroundings and the lingering phantom sensation of being held.
Eleven back home. He'd never overslept this badly in his life, but at least he hadn't woken at two in the morning. The jet lag could have been worse.
A long hot bath helped loosen the stiffness from travel and sleep, and by six-thirty he was dressed in the dark blue suit, feeling more human. The hotel restaurant was already serving breakfast, and he found Ian already there, drinking coffee as if he had been awake for hours.
"Good morning. I trust you slept well?"
Jay took the seat across from him. "Better than expected. How long have you been up?"
"Since four. I found the hotel gym and managed a decent workout. Amazing what a proper fitness facility can do for jet lag recovery." Ian's smile was pleased, as if the early morning routine had energized him. 
Jay stared at him with awe. Ian had accomplished so much before dawn, while Jay only managed to return to consciousness. "That's truly impressive."
"Years of habit. The driver won't arrive until nine, so we have plenty of time."
Jay marveled at Ian's stamina as they ate breakfast together, followed by fresh fruit that was somehow more vibrant and flavourful than anything available back home. Everything about the hotel was excessive—the portions, the variety, the service.
"This is my first stay at a proper five-star hotel. I didn't fully appreciate it yesterday."
"The New Continent doesn't do anything by halves. You'll notice that theme everywhere we go."
Jay started to appreciate Leo's outfit intervention as they prepared for their meetings. The expensive suits allowed him to stand beside Ian without shame, even in surroundings that screamed wealth and power.
At eight-thirty, they returned to their rooms to gather their things. Jay couldn't resist taking photos for his siblings—posing next to the enormous bed and at the window overlooking the massive skyline that dwarfed his home city. Everything here was built on a scale that defied reason.
The Garnet Ridge Group offices occupied three floors of a gleaming tower, their reception area alone larger than most companies' entire premises. The CEO, Mac Cartwright, greeted Ian like a long-lost friend, and Jay watched Ian become instantly charming and engaging, moving with an ease that showed how natural this world was for him.
The morning meetings covered strategic partnerships and investment opportunities, topics Jay followed with interest while taking detailed notes. The tour of their offices followed—a company much larger than Turner & Associates, though Jay was becoming accustomed to opulent business environments and wasn't startled by the grandeur.
Lunch at a nearby restaurant felt more like a social visit than a business meal. Jay listened to Ian trade university stories with Mac, fascinated by glimpses of Ian's younger self. The camaraderie between old friends made Jay envious of that kind of belonging.
After lunch, they returned for another round of meetings focused on technical details. Jay was sustained by double coffees and glad that his good night's sleep had left him functional. But as four o'clock approached, fatigue began to creep in.
"We should head back to the hotel. Dinner's not until eight, so you should rest," Ian said as the meetings concluded. 
Jay accepted the advice, setting an alarm for seven before collapsing onto the hotel bed. Sleep came immediately, but the alarm left him groggy and disoriented. Only complimentary coffee in the restaurant managed to restore some semblance of alertness.
Dinner was held at an exclusive restaurant that felt more like a private club. Besides Mac, two other executives and a senior staffer joined them, and Jay quickly realized the cultural differences Ian had mentioned. Where their homeland favoured restraint, these people were boisterous and gregarious. Everyone here reminded him of Max, but dialed up even further. Jay smiled and contributed politely when addressed, but mostly observed Ian. 
Jay abstained from alcohol, but Ian shared whiskey with their hosts, and the gathering grew increasingly animated. Jay held onto a single glass of wine, while Ian matched their hosts drink for drink without showing any effects.
By eleven, the executives were thoroughly intoxicated, their conversation growing louder and more inappropriate. Jay was uncomfortable with the casual crudeness, so different from the environments he knew.
As they prepared to leave, one of the executives made a comment that froze Jay's blood.
"Old Continent certainly knows how to do business. Do your managers routinely travel with such beautiful escorts? Very progressive approach to client relations."
The silence that followed was deafening. Ian's expression went from pleasant to ice-cold fury so quickly that Jay actually took a step back.
"I beg your pardon?" Ian's voice was deadly quiet.
"Oh, come now, don't be coy. Your pretty little—"
"Mr. Hall is my assistant." Ian's words cut through the drunken rambling like a blade. "If you're suggesting what I think you're suggesting, this conversation and our business relationship end right here."
Mac tried to intervene, his face pale with embarrassment. "Zac has had too much to drink, Ian. He doesn't mean—"
"He knows exactly what he means. And I know exactly what kind of company keeps executives who think it's acceptable to sexually harass visiting employees."
Jay hung his head, used to being the target of crude jokes and casual objectification, but the humiliation still burned. He'd hoped the expensive clothes and formal setting would protect him from this kind of treatment, but apparently nothing could.
"Ian, please—" Mac began.
"We're leaving. And you can consider any potential partnership permanently terminated."
They left in a decidedly sour mood, Ian's fury palpable as they walked through the lobby. Only when they reached the car did Ian speak.
"I'm sorry you had to endure that. I definitely won't be doing business with a company that harasses my employees."
"Please don't let it affect your decision-making. Comments like that aren't unusual. It's really not worth—"
"It's absolutely a matter of principle. Some behaviours will not be tolerated under any circumstances."
Back in his room, Jay showered and prepared for bed, but sleep wouldn't come. The executive's words echoed in his mind, along with Ian's fierce defence and the promise to cancel their entire business relationship over the slight. After an hour of staring at the ceiling, he gave up and dressed in his designer outfit—his only clothing that seemed appropriate for the hotel's elegant bar.
The lounge was nearly empty at midnight, just a few other guests and jazz playing in the background. Jay ordered whiskey, hoping alcohol might help him relax enough for sleep.
He was surprised when Ian appeared ten minutes later.
"Couldn't sleep either?" Ian asked.
"I didn't figure you for someone who had trouble sleeping. Thought you had that executive discipline down to a science," Jay replied, attempting lightness.
"I also didn't figure you for much of a drinker," Ian said, signaling the bartender. In truth, he had heard Jay moving around and followed him down.
"It would be a pity not to make use of such a nice hotel. Though truthfully, that afternoon nap probably did me in," Jay said with a wry smile.
"I'm having trouble sleeping as well," Ian admitted, which was true enough. He had been at his laptop, plotting ways to destroy the man who had insulted Jay. "We're supposed to have another meeting tomorrow morning with Garnet Ridge Group executives, but I'm cancelling it along with the entire deal."
"That seems excessive. Being crude toward junior staff isn't exactly unusual in business."
"Not on my watch," Ian said firmly. His inner thoughts were far darker—how dare that man have such thoughts about his Jay? He would wreck the executive's entire career and the company along with it if necessary.
Jay seemed to sense the dangerous undercurrent in Ian's mood and changed the subject. "What's your history with their CEO? You seem to know each other well."
Ian accepted the subject change, perhaps sensing Jay needed distraction from the evening's unpleasantness. They talked for nearly an hour about university days, travel experiences, anything that kept the conversation light and meandering.
"We should probably get some rest," Ian finally said as the bar staff began subtle cleanup around them. "Though I suppose you don't need to wake up early tomorrow, given that our schedule just cleared up."
Jay smiled as they walked toward the elevators. "You certainly are tenacious when you've been drinking."
"I prefer principled, but tenacious works too."
In his room, Jay finally felt drowsy enough for sleep. The evening had been salvaged by Ian's company, even if the business trip itself had taken an unfortunate turn.
Meanwhile, Ian sat in his own room, laptop open. The fury still simmered, made worse by the memory of how defeated Jay appeared after that bastard's comment.
This was supposed to be an exclusively pleasant experience, and some insignificant man had cast a shadow over it. Ian would make sure there were consequences for anyone who dared treat Jay with such disrespect.
Scene 4
Apologies
Jay didn't turn off his alarm. At six-thirty, the shrill sound jolted him from sleep, groggy but functional enough to face another day. He dressed in the gray suit—the third from his collection, ensuring he wouldn't repeat an outfit—and made his way to the restaurant by seven.
Ian was already there, coffee in hand and breakfast half-finished, but his expression showed surprise at Jay's punctual arrival.
"I thought you might sleep in this morning," Ian said as Jay sat across from him with a full plate and coffee.
Jay stifled a dramatic yawn. "Still not used to the time zone, apparently. My body thinks it's one in the afternoon."
"Did you sleep well?"
"Well enough. Just need coffee and sustenance."
Ian wanted to suggest Jay return to bed, but that might come across too strongly. He also didn't want to dwell on the previous evening's unpleasantness first thing in the morning, so he steered the conversation toward safer topics until Jay brought it up himself.
"About yesterday evening—do you really intend to drop the negotiation?"
"I do. Some behaviours can't be overlooked, regardless of potential profit."
Jay felt awkward about being the cause of such a dramatic business decision, but he understood it wasn't truly his fault. Some foolish man had dared act presumptuously to Ian's face and would have to face the consequences. His own bad luck for being so shameless.
They were preparing to leave the restaurant when Mac Cartwright appeared, wearing a mortified expression.
"Ian, Jay—please, could I have a moment? I cannot begin to express how appalled I am by Zac's behaviour last night. He was terminated immediately, first thing this morning. There's absolutely no excuse for such conduct, and it reflects terribly on my leadership."
Jay felt his cheeks burn with embarrassment at the public nature of the apology. Ian remained stone-faced, clearly unimpressed by the gesture.
"I understand your position, but—"
"Please. Give me a chance to prove our company's integrity isn't defined by one man's inexcusable behaviour. We have a scheduled visit to our tech lab this morning—let me show you the innovation we're truly about."
Ian glanced at Jay, who nodded despite his discomfort. "I'm fine with that," Jay said.
"Very well, I suppose we could proceed with the morning appointment," Ian replied.
The tech lab was an hour's drive outside the city, a gleaming facility that buzzed with activity even on Saturday. They received a tour that showcased cutting-edge development projects, ending in Mac presenting Jay with an unexpected gift.
"This is a prototype of our latest design. Impossible to purchase, limited to fifty units worldwide. Ultra-lightweight but incredibly durable, with specifications that won't be commercially available for another two years."
Jay stared at the device. "I can't possibly accept this."
"Please. It's a sincere apology for the unacceptable treatment you received. Consider it a small gesture toward making amends. It's the least we can do after such an unforgivable breach of hospitality."
Jay looked helplessly at Ian, who appeared more amused than anything else by Jay's obvious discomfort with the lavish gesture.
"It's entirely up to you whether you choose to forgive them," Ian said solemnly.
Jay caught Ian's barely concealed mirth and rolled his eyes at Ian's feigned gravity before accepting the laptop with as much grace as he could muster. The deal, apparently, was saved.
Back at the hotel after lunch, Ian reminded Jay of his promise. "Time for that shopping expedition. We have siblings to satisfy."
"You don't have to do this," Jay said, feeling sheepish about the entire enterprise.
"Nonsense. A promise is a promise."
Ian insisted they visit the city's most impressive shopping complex. The mall was enormous, a testament to New Continent excess, with stores Jay had only heard of in magazines.
Ian guided him through specialty confectionery shops, toy stores with elaborate displays, electronics boutiques with the latest gadgets. At a cosmetics counter, a helpful clerk assembled a bag of trendy makeup for Ema without Jay even knowing what half the products were for.
"Company card for everything," Ian insisted when Jay reached for his wallet. "Leo needs to cover expenses for his meddling."
They also sent postcards—Jay writing brief messages to each sibling while Ian waited patiently nearby.
By the time they returned to the hotel, Jay was exhausted and laden with shopping bags, staring at the collection with dismay.
"How am I going to fit all this in my suitcase?"
"Don't worry about logistics. I'll handle the packing arrangements."
That evening, Ian took Jay to dinner at a restaurant that occupied the top floor of the city's tallest building. The view was spectacular, the food exceptional.
"This place has insane waiting times," Ian explained as they were seated at a table. "Nearly impossible to get into. But I still have some strings to pull, despite everything. Since we're here, it would be a pity not to take advantage."
Jay was once again grateful for his tailored clothes—at least he didn't stand out among the other diners, all of whom looked wealthy and sophisticated.
"How do you find the New Continent?" Ian asked over dessert.
"Impressive, but overwhelming. I doubt they need quite this many lanes and highways everywhere. And the parking lots are the size of small towns. They could use more green spaces—I much prefer the parks back home."
"I don't disagree. It's not really to my taste either. Too loud, too big for its own good."
"I'm glad the deal didn't fall through after all. It would have felt awkward to have my first business trip end in failure."
"It wouldn't have been a failure. Determining that a company isn't a good partner is valuable information, often more so than pushing for any deal regardless of the circumstances."
Jay had to concede the point, impressed once again by Ian's wisdom and principled approach to business. 
They left the restaurant while it was still early evening, knowing they had to wake at four in the morning for their flight home. Jay packed, setting out his more casual clothes for the morning travel, but despite his exhaustion, he couldn't fall asleep.
It had been an intense trip—successful but emotionally complicated. Jay lay in the hotel bed, processing the business dealings, the uncomfortable incident, and through it all, Ian's unexpected protectiveness.
Two days had shown him more of the world than he'd seen in his entire previous life, but they'd also revealed depths to his connection with Ian that made him increasingly uncertain about the true nature of their relationship.
Scene 5
Journey Home
The alarm at four-thirty felt like a cruel joke. Jay woke feeling like he'd been hit by a train, his body heavy with exhaustion despite going to bed early. The poor sleep had left him sluggish and disoriented, moving through the morning on autopilot.
He cleaned up, packed the remainder of his belongings, and checked the hotel room five times to ensure nothing was forgotten—documents in order, passport secured, chargers packed, toiletries accounted for. By five minutes to five, he dragged himself to the lobby where Ian waited, looking composed, his luggage already loaded in the waiting car.
While Ian appeared immaculate, Jay felt like a zombie. The drive to the airport passed in silence, Jay slumping against the leather seat, half-awake.
Ian guided him through the airport procedures. Jay barely registered the process, noting dimly that they seemed to have more bags than when they'd arrived—presumably containing yesterday's shopping haul.
At the terminal, an announcement crackled through the speakers about weather delays. Jay didn't catch the details, too exhausted to focus.
They found seats in an airport café, Ian returning with coffee and asking gently, "Do you feel like breakfast?"
Jay fumbled with the toast and eggs they ordered, managing only a few bites before giving up. Ian watched with growing concern, finally probing softly.
"Is something wrong? Beyond the obvious exhaustion, I mean."
Jay sighed deeply. "How is it possible that you're so put together despite this demanding schedule and the jetlag? I can barely function."
Ian laughed. "Years of practice. I've been flying regularly for over thirty years—it does get easier once you adapt to the demands."
Another announcement declared a two-hour delay. Jay groaned audibly.
"We were supposed to arrive at nine. Now it's eleven, and I won't be home before midnight. I'll have trouble getting up for work tomorrow."
"You don't need to come in. Business travel grants you a recovery day."
"Will you be coming in?"
Ian hesitated. "I will, yes."
"Then I'll come too."
"Jay, you don't need to force yourself—"
"If you can manage it, so can I."
Ian relented, sensing it might be a matter of pride, but privately worried about Jay pushing himself too hard. They moved to the business class lounge, where Jay collapsed onto a relatively comfortable bench and immediately dozed off, the coffee having done little to combat his exhaustion.
Ian watched over him, fighting the urge to smooth the hair from Jay's forehead or adjust the awkward angle of his neck. Jay drifted in and out of consciousness, looking young and vulnerable.
Another announcement woke Jay: the delay had increased to four hours. Jay groaned, but Ian smiled.
"Flight delays happen. They're not exactly rare. Consider it a learning experience—whenever you plan to fly, it's wise to anticipate possible delays. At least it happened on the return journey."
They returned to the café for more coffee, Jay looking marginally more alert. As they sat overlooking the terminal's bustle, Jay's expression grew wistful.
"Something bothering you?" Ian asked.
Jay's defenses were lowered by exhaustion and the strange feeling of displacement. "I'll never get used to this high-stakes society. Never stop being an imposter. As much as I enjoy and appreciate the opportunities, each one just showcases my own limitations," he blurted out.
"That's not true, is it? People are the same regardless of how they were born—some are kind, some are not. If anything, wealth and power tend to make people worse, not better. As you saw firsthand this week, being rich and successful doesn't automatically make someone deserving of respect. Kindness and integrity matter—everything else is superficial. The clothes, the manners, the insider knowledge—none of that measures a person's worth."
"I suppose. But it's hard when people higher in the hierarchy harass or insult me."
"Is it easier when someone poor harasses and insults you?"
Jay paused, thinking of various unpleasant encounters with peers over the years. Was his pride less wounded then? "No," he admitted. "I feel small no matter who it comes from."
"Exactly. Harassment is the harasser's fault, not yours. It doesn't matter if you're disparaged by a tailor, an executive, or a janitor—they're behaving badly, and it says nothing about your value. Harassment isn't more valid coming from wealthy people, just as poverty doesn't automatically make someone kind."
Jay pondered it. Maybe Ian was right. Perhaps he'd been paying too much attention to status, judging people by bank accounts and not actions. Once again, Ian's wisdom impressed him, and he looked at him with undisguised admiration.
"I tend to get lost in my head about perceived inadequacies," Jay admitted sheepishly.
"There's nothing inadequate about you at all." Ian's voice held such conviction that Jay felt heat rush to his cheeks, his gaze dropping to the floor. Praise from Ian always felt monumental.
The delay stretched to six hours. They ate an early lunch in the lounge, and Jay consumed four cups of coffee before he finally felt awake.
"Now I won't be able to sleep at all," Jay moaned as they boarded the plane.
Takeoff was less exciting the second time, and cloud cover limited the view from his window. 
"Maybe this time we'll actually manage to watch that movie," Ian joked, and they did attempt it, but they both found the comedy decidedly unfunny. They switched to a historical drama that Jay loved and Ian found absolutely terrible.
"The costumes are beautiful," Jay protested as Ian criticized the production values.
"Cheap, fake, and melodramatic," Ian countered, though he seemed amused by Jay's enthusiasm.
After plane dinner, Jay finally managed to nap, waking just before landing at three in the morning. Even Ian looked tired now.
"Now even I won't come to work Monday," Ian admitted. "Feel free to take the day off and rest properly."
The driver took Jay home first. Ian handed him the additional suitcase containing the siblings' gifts, and Jay struggled to manage everything up to his small apartment. The luggage and new clothes made the space feel impossibly crowded—he clearly couldn't delay his apartment search any longer.
Despite his exhaustion, Jay fell into bed feeling happy. The trip had been intense, challenging, and occasionally uncomfortable, but Ian had been beside him through every moment. Whatever complexities existed in their relationship, Jay's fundamental assessment remained unchanged.
Ian was the best person he'd ever known, and working for him remained the greatest privilege of Jay's life.
Chapter 25: Tropical heat
Scene 1
Reset
The morning light streamed across the room, and Jay realized from its brightness that he’d slept too long. His phone confirmed it was past ten in the morning. The jetlag had hit harder than expected, leaving him feeling disoriented and heavy-limbed. He lay still for a moment, letting his mind catch up with the reality that he was back in his small studio that suddenly felt impossibly cramped after the spacious hotel suite.
The chill in the air when he opened his window made it clear that autumn was approaching fast. Quarterly reports will start in October, and with them, the chaos that consumed everyone's lives for at least a week. He needed to get his affairs in order before work swallowed him whole again.
A proper breakfast seemed like the right place to start. He dressed in his favorite jeans and one of his two remaining t-shirts, then walked to the café down the street. The warmth of the place and the hearty breakfast of eggs, toast, and strong coffee helped clear the fog from his mind. By the time he returned home, he felt ready to tackle the mountain of unpacking that awaited him.
His own suitcase, which he had bought just months ago and considered quite nice at the time, looked shabby next to the two pristine pieces that had accompanied him home, courtesy of Ian and Leo. Both were top-of-the-line, and Jay ran his fingers over the smooth leather with appreciation.
He started with the gifts, complete with complimentary presentation boxes. Ian had insisted on the expensive options, brushing aside Jay's protests with a firm "Leo's paying" whenever Jay had tried to suggest something more reasonable. Jay prepared everything for shipping to his siblings, already dreading their reactions to such lavish presents.
They had also purchased souvenirs for their team members, which Jay thought was a thoughtful gesture.
Afterwards Jay turned to his clothes. The process was both revelatory and depressing. His casual wardrobe had already been decimated. There was nothing left to donate. He was down to one pair of jeans, one pair of sweatpants, and two t-shirts for casual wear, not counting his gym clothes. He didn't even own hoodies anymore. Everything else had been gradually replaced by an ever-growing collection of formal attire.
Ten suits now hung in his closet. The new three-piece sets from the upscale tailor commanded the center position, flanked by lighter summer suits, event wear, and the pieces he had accumulated over the winter. A tuxedo hung at one end, and two designer outfits that no longer seemed quite so outlandish completed the formal section. The resort wear, shirts, shoes, and ties that couldn't fit in the closet were relegated to the suitcases, which now formed an awkward tower in the center of his living room. His casual clothes perched precariously on top, making the whole arrangement look like some bizarre fashion installation.
His studio had transformed into what looked like a high-end clothing warehouse. Jay stood in the middle of it all, hands on his hips, surveying the space with dismay. This wasn't how normal people lived.
The afternoon trip to the post office provided a welcome break from the domestic chaos. The postal worker raised an eyebrow at the declared value of the packages, but Jay just smiled and paid the insurance fees. Once the gifts were safely dispatched, he sent Ema a photo from the hotel room with a simple message: "Trip was great. Expect deliveries promptly."
His phone rang within minutes.
"Jay! This place looks incredible! Tell me everything. Did you really stay somewhere this fancy? What was the food like? Did you meet anyone interesting? And what did you send us?"
Jay smiled as he walked home. He kept the details light, focusing on the sights and the food. By the time they hung up, some of his own confusion had subsided.
That evening, he cooked dinner for the entire week, portioning everything into containers, and prepared his clothes and equipment for work. 
The new laptop sat on his table next to his old one, the contrast almost cruel. His college computer, which had served him faithfully for years and required countless hours of part-time work to afford, now looked like something salvaged from a scrapyard. The sleek new machine was undoubtedly superior in every way, but Jay couldn't bring himself to use it. It represented something he resented—a bribe to placate Ian after Jay had been treated like a prostitute. A gesture to smooth over the humiliation he had endured.
But then Ian's words echoed in his memory. The harasser was the one who had behaved badly, and it had no bearing on Jay as a person. Ian had protected him, would continue to protect him. With Ian around, he didn't need to fear anyone trying to take advantage of him.
It was a good thought, one that helped quiet the more troubling feelings the gift evoked.
He arrived at work at seven-thirty Tuesday morning to find Ian already in the office. They exchanged their typical morning greetings, and Jay felt emboldened by their shared experience. After dropping his things and powering up his computer, Jay walked into Ian's office for a chat.
"How's the jetlag treating you?" Jay asked.
"Better than expected. I managed a decent night's sleep. What about you? You look much more alert than you did at the airport. I was worried you might struggle more with the adjustment."  
"Still feeling a bit off-schedule, but nothing coffee can't handle. When did you get in this morning?"  
"Six-thirty. Did you manage to get everything sorted at home?"
"Eventually. Though my apartment now looks like a clothing warehouse exploded in it. I had to stack suitcases in the middle of my living room just to fit everything."
"Is the space becoming a problem? We could look into storage solutions, or perhaps it's time to consider a larger apartment."
The comment was casual, but Ian's tone made Jay look at him more closely. There was a relaxation in his posture that hadn't been there in weeks, an ease that reminded Jay of their late-night conversations before everything had become complicated.
"I'm not sure I'm ready for that yet. It's just... a lot to adjust to." Jay paused, choosing his words carefully. "The whole trip was... eye-opening. I learned a lot."
"It was good to get away from the office. Sometimes perspective requires a change of scenery."
Both seeming to recognize that they were talking around something larger. Jay felt the weight of all the things he couldn't say: how the walls they had both built seemed suddenly unnecessary.
"You handled yourself admirably. I hope it wasn't too overwhelming."
"It wasn't. And thank you. For everything. For protecting me."
As he returned to his desk, Jay realized that his understanding of what he wanted changed. Jay wanted to be closer to Ian. Maybe not a friend—he was still a subordinate, after all—but something more than just an employee. Ian had become someone he could rely on, someone who had proven himself worthy of trust. And Jay wanted to be the same for him.
An anchor. Someone solid and dependable in a world that had shown Ian too little kindness.
The community Ian was born into had rejected him despite his obvious worth, despite him being a victim of a scheme. The injustice was unthinkable, but perhaps Ian was right about there being no separate worlds—just people who were small and petty regardless of their status.
Scene 2
Souvenirs
Jay began sorting through the backlog that had accumulated despite his efforts to stay on top of emails during the trip. Several tasks had fallen behind schedule, and with the month drawing to a close, he wanted everything sorted before October's chaos descended upon them.
His colleagues gradually came into the office, each asking about his trip. Jay waited until everyone was in place before making his rounds with the souvenirs. He had prepared a diverse collection: local confectionery, special edition hot sauces, designer bracelets, leather key-chains, and various other small treasures that captured the essence of their destination.
"Alright everyone, gather round. We brought back a few things," Jay announced, producing the first bag of gifts. 
The vintage band t-shirts were an immediate hit with Luc and Kim. They rifled through, attempting to claim the most coveted pieces.
"No way," Kim said, holding up a faded tour shirt. "Where did you even find this?"
"The hotel concierge recommended a vintage shop," Jay explained. 
"This one's mine. Absolutely no negotiation," Kim declared.
"You can have that one if I get this," Luc countered, clutching a shirt from a band Jay had never heard of but that apparently held cultural weight.
"You two are pathetic," Amy joked.
Jay was relieved to see that Luc looked better than he had before the trip. The hollow look around his eyes had faded, and his energy was returning. Still, Jay had prepared something special for him.
"Luc, this one's for you. It's supposed to be comforting, made with warm spices. Thought you might appreciate it," Jay said, producing a large block of chocolate.
Luc accepted the gift with exaggerated solemnity, then broke into a grin. "Are you trying to tell me I need comfort chocolate? Because that's both insulting and completely accurate."
"Just thought you might enjoy it."
"Well, since you put actual thought into this, I suppose I can forgive the implication that I'm emotionally fragile."
"You know what? After the quarterly reports are done and we're all human again, we should do something fun. Something completely different," Jay suddenly said.
"That sounds great. What did you have in mind?"
"I don't know yet, but something adventurous. Or at least more interesting than post-crisis drinks." 
Luc tilted his head, watching Jay with suspicion. "Wait a minute. Did someone switch you out for a different person during this trip? Because the Jay who left here would never suggest doing something different and fun without at least three layers of anxiety about it."
"Maybe I just learned a few things while I was away."
"Clearly. I approve of this upgraded version."
Once the gifts were distributed, the team naturally gathered around Jay's desk, eager for details about the trip. He kept his stories light and focused on the cultural aspects: the impressive hotels, the restaurants, the general atmosphere of the destination.
"The negotiations were about as boring as you'd expect. Standard corporate meetings, nothing worth mentioning. But the restaurant where we had dinner was incredible. Completely different vibe from anywhere here. You know how the Palladium feels all stately and old-world? This place was the opposite. Ultra-modern, cosmopolitan. Made me feel like I was in a movie."
He avoided any mention of the disastrous incident. That part of the trip still felt too complicated to share as casual office anecdotes.
The storytelling session gradually dissolved as everyone returned to their own work, and Jay threw himself back into his tasks. He worked through the afternoon, clearing his backlog and organizing priorities for the coming days.
At five o'clock sharp, he began shutting down his computer and gathering his things.
"Heading out?" Ian asked, appearing at his desk.
"Gym day. Already missed Saturday, and Rus is definitely going to make me pay for it. He's going to push me twice as hard to make up for the missed session."
Ian's face showed the faintest hint of amusement. "It'll be worth it. Better to face the punishment now than let it compound."
"Easy for you to say. You're not the one who's going to be doing extra sets." Jay headed for the elevator, calling back over his shoulder. "See you tomorrow."
Ian watched him go, his composed expression slipping the moment Jay disappeared around the corner. Four days together had been like a glimpse of paradise, and now having to let him walk away each evening felt like a particular form of punishment. The shared meals, the conversations that lasted late into the night, all of it had felt natural, right, like something he could build a life around.
The quarterly reports couldn't come soon enough. A week of consistent overtime meant he would get to see Jay from dawn to dusk, a prospect that filled him with anticipation even as he recognized how pathetic that made him. He forced himself to focus on his work, but thoughts of Jay persisted, threading through every task like a constant undercurrent.
At the gym, Jay presented Rus with his own gift: a t-shirt and baseball cap from an iconic athletic brand, both featuring designs that weren't available locally.
"Just a small thank you. For taking such good care of me all these months."
Rus looked touched, which made the gesture feel completely justified. "This is really thoughtful of you. I appreciate it."
"I'm glad you like them."
"Of course, you realize this changes nothing about tonight's workout. In fact, since you clearly think you can bribe me into going easy on you, I'm going to have to double your routine. Can't have you thinking gifts will get you special treatment."
"I was afraid you'd say that."
The workout was indeed brutal, but Jay met it with energy he hadn't expected. He joked with Rus between sets, feeling more relaxed than he had in weeks. There was something liberating about returning to his own spaces after the trip.
"You seem different tonight," Rus observed as Jay finished a particularly challenging set. "More energized. Things better at work?"
"Yeah, for the time being. Though that's about to change. We're heading into quarterly report season, which means I won't be able to come to the gym for at least a week."
Rus shook his head with mock disapproval. "The gym should be an obvious priority. I don't care how busy work gets, you need to maintain your routine."
"Tell that to my boss when I'm working fourteen-hour days."
"I will if I have to. Health comes first, career comes second. That's not negotiable."
Jay laughed, appreciating both the concern and the absurdity of imagining Rus lecturing Ian about workout schedules. "I'll do my best to sneak in a session or two if I can."
"See that you do. I don't want to have to start over from scratch when you come back."
On his way home, Jay made one final stop at Café Lemon. Fay was behind the counter, and her face lit up when she saw him approaching with a small bag.
"Jay! How was your trip?"
"Incredible. I brought you something. Just a small thank you for all the great coffee over the years."
Fay opened the bag to reveal an assortment of artisanal chocolates. "Oh my goodness, these look amazing! You didn't have to do this."
"I wanted to. You've been making my days better for a long time now."
"Well, in that case, let me make your evening better too. What can I get you?"
"Hot chocolate. It's getting chilly, and coffee this late would keep me up all night."
As Fay prepared his drink, they chatted about the changing weather and the melancholy that seemed to hang over the city as autumn approached.
"The days are getting shorter. Always makes everything feel more contemplative," Fay mused.
"I don't mind it as much as I used to," Jay admitted.
"There's something nice about this time of year. Everything slowing down, getting cosy. Makes you appreciate the simple things."
"I know what you mean. After a weekend of fancy restaurants, there's something perfect about just... this."
"Sounds like you had quite an adventure."
"I did. But it's good to be home."
Jay walked home feeling happy. It had been a good day. Most of his post-trip plans were complete, and tomorrow he could focus entirely on work. He felt ready for the challenges ahead.
Perhaps he should have been exhausted after such an intense week, but he wasn't. He felt motivated and notably less tense. The business trip had reset his perspective on his work, his relationships, and his place in the world around him.
As he prepared dinner in his crowded apartment, surrounded by suitcases that served as a tangible reminder of how much his life had changed, Jay looked forward to tomorrow.
Scene 3
The grind
The quarterly reports came like a plague, turning the normally pleasant workspace into a pressure cooker of frayed nerves. Jay had hoped that experience would make this round easier, but if anything, it felt worse than before. The workload was relentless, the atmosphere tense, and everyone seemed to be operating on a hair trigger. The quarterly bonus notification that appeared on his phone might as well have been spam for all the attention he paid it. Everything outside the immediate demands of work faded into irrelevance.
Minor mistakes that would normally warrant a gentle correction now provoked sharp responses. Files that couldn't be located immediately became sources of panic. Jay was walking on eggshells, triple-checking everything and speaking in measured tones to avoid adding to the stress.
"Where's the Hartwell compliance folder?" Amy's called across the office.
Jay looked up from his screen where he was formatting the third revision of the Mayfield summary. "Client documentation server, compliance subfolder, dated last Thursday."
"I already checked there."
Jay saved his work and walked over to Amy's desk. He pulled up the network directory and searched through the folders. "Here. You were in the wrong quarterly folder."
"Thanks. Jesus, why do we have so many sub-folders?" Amy muttered.
Jay returned to his desk, immediately diving back into the spreadsheet that had consumed the last two hours, but shortly after Luc appeared.
"Jay. Can you format these client profiles? The template's giving me trouble."
"I'm in the middle of—"
"Please? It's for the board packet, and I'm drowning here."
Jay glanced toward Ian's office. Through the glass wall, he could see Ian hunched over his computer. He wanted to see if Ian needed anything, but Luc was already pulling up a chair.
"Fine. Send me the files."
From the corner of his eye, Jay caught Ian emerging from his office, moving toward the kitchen. Their eyes met briefly, and Jay wanted to join him, to have even a thirty-second conversation about something other than data formatting. But Luc was already launching into another technical complaint, and by the time Jay looked up again, Ian was gone.
The pattern repeated throughout the day. Jay would finish one task only to be intercepted by another colleague with another urgent request. Each one was necessary and time-sensitive. And each one kept Jay anchored to his desk or someone else's, never free to step into Ian's office for a check-in.
Even Ian seemed affected. The man who always maintained perfect composure appeared increasingly strained as the days wore on, his jaw tight and his responses clipped. Jay saw him staring at spreadsheets with resentment, which was so unlike him that Jay wondered if he was imagining things.
"Hartwell is more demanding than anticipated. It's just one client, but the reporting requirements are extensive," Ian muttered during one of their brief status meetings, rubbing his temples.
Jay nodded, not trusting himself to say anything more than basic acknowledgement. He was struggling to keep up with his own responsibilities, let alone provide meaningful input on strategic concerns.
The phone call from his siblings came at the worst possible moment, the caller ID showing Tim's name.
"Jay! This watch is incredible! Where did you even find something like this? Ari thinks you robbed a bank!"
"I'm glad you like it, but this is a terrible time. We're in the middle of quarterly reports and—"
"Just five minutes! We wanted to tell you about—"
"I can't. I'll call you back in a week when this is over."
"But—"
"I really can't right now. I'm sorry."
He hung up without registering their disappointment, his mind already moving to the next task. 
His gym membership went unused. The pool he had been so excited about became a distant memory. Thoughts of his diving lessons were pushed aside by the immediate crisis of deadlines and data analysis.
Saturday and Sunday blended into the weekdays, distinguished only by the fact that the building was emptier. Jay arrived early and left late, his world shrinking to the narrow corridor between his desk and Ian's office.
By six o'clock on Sunday, the office had taken on the atmosphere of a crisis centre. Papers covered every available surface. Someone had ordered dinner, and the team ate at their desks without conversation.
Jay had managed exactly two direct interactions with Ian all day, a brief handoff of formatted reports and a thirty-second status update on client communications. Each conversation had felt stilted and formal.
"I think I overextended us. Each quarter it's getting harder to manage the increased responsibilities," Ian admitted as they worked through yet another set of compliance documents.
Jay looked up from his computer, surprised by the admission. Ian never expressed doubt about strategic decisions, at least not in front of staff. "It's manageable. We're getting through it," Jay replied, though they both knew it was barely true.
Ian's smile was tired. "We are. Though I'm not sure at what cost."
When the reports were finally submitted on Thursday and the immediate crisis passed, the collective exhale from the entire team was almost audible. Jay slumped at his desk, staring blankly at his computer screen.
"That's it. We're done," Max announced.
Jay gathered his things, his mind already turning to the quarterly party the next evening. He glanced toward Ian's office, where Ian was shutting down his computer. They had worked in the same space for ten days straight, but Jay realized they had barely spoken beyond the requirements of immediate business.
The quarterly party, traditionally a celebration of successful completion, felt more like a wake for their sanity.
Jay dressed up for the occasion, selecting the dark gray three-piece suit that had made him feel confident during the business trip. Looking at himself in the mirror, he thought he looked like a senator or some other dignitary. The suit was undeniably elegant, but in the context of his normal life, it felt almost conspicuous in its quality.
Had it been this obvious during the trip? Perhaps he had been too overwhelmed by everything else to notice, but now the fine tailoring and expensive fabric seemed to announce themselves. He adjusted his tie nervously, half-expecting someone to comment, but when he arrived at the venue, no one seemed to notice or care.
The place was impeccable as always, the entertainment top-notch, the food and drink abundant. But the team drifted through it all, drained past the point of enjoyment.
Instead of networking and animated conversation, everyone gravitated toward chairs and quiet corners. The bar became a refuge, with people slouched on stools, eyes drifting between their half-finished glasses and the far wall.
Amy slumped in an armchair, Luc had claimed an entire section of seating, sprawling across it like he was recovering from a marathon. Even Max sat quietly, sipping whiskey and watching the party with unfocused eyes.
Jay sat at the bar, not interested in drinking but drawn to the relative quiet of the space.
"Rough quarter?" the bartender asked, more as a courtesy.
"The roughest yet," Jay replied, accepting a glass of wine he didn't want.
The week’s grind showed in Ian as well. His composure held, but traces of fatigue slipped through, attributed to the toll of the week’s demands. People nodded at him with sympathy, recognizing that even their seemingly indestructible CFO had been worn down.
"Even the man of steel looks beat," Kim said to Jay, gesturing toward where Ian stood in conversation with some board members. "If he's this tired, the rest of us must look like zombies."
Jay followed Kim's gesture and saw what he meant. Ian's posture was perfect, but his expression looked grim.
What Jay couldn't know was that Ian's mood had little to do with the workload itself and everything to do with the loss of their private evening conversations. The week that should have brought them together through shared overtime had instead kept them constantly surrounded by the full team, with Jay pulled in different directions by various colleagues who needed his help.
Ian had looked forward to those late nights, imagining moments where they could decompress together, share the burden of the work. Instead, he had watched Jay field constant requests from Amy, Luc, Kim, and others, his attention divided among so many people that their own interactions had been reduced to brief exchanges.
He had the perfect excuse to spend extensive time with Jay, but the circumstances made connection impossible. It was like being offered a feast while being too sick to eat.
As people began making their excuses to leave, Jay caught Ian's eye across the room. They shared a look that acknowledged the exhaustion and the relief that it was over. Tonight, they would go home to recover from a week that had tested everyone's limits.
Scene 4
Recovery and preparation
Jay sat propped against his pillows on Saturday morning, phone in hand, finally ready to face the conversations he had cut short during the week. He dialed his siblings' number, bracing himself for the inevitable complaints.
"Well, well, we were starting to think you'd forgotten we exist," Tim's voice came through with obvious irritation.
"I told you I was busy with—"
"Yeah, yeah, quarterly reports. We heard. You couldn't spare five minutes all week?"
"I'm sorry about that. The quarterly reports were—"
"Were more important than your family. You get a new, fancy job, and suddenly we're no longer worth your time." 
"You don't understand. Gifts this expensive don't come for free. I have to pay my dues by giving up about a week of my lifespan every quarter to reporting demands. It's non-negotiable."
"That's a bit dramatic, don't you think?" Tim shot back.
"Tim, stop it." Ema's voice cut through his complaints. "You don't understand the grown-up working world. Jay had responsibilities."
Jay felt a wave of gratitude toward his sister. "Thank you, Ema. It really was impossible to take personal calls."
"We know," Ema said warmly. "Now tell us about these amazing gifts. Tim hasn't taken the watch off since it arrived."
The tension dissolved as his siblings launched into enthusiastic descriptions of their presents. Jay listened with growing amusement as they detailed every feature of their gifts, comparing them to friends' possessions and generally reveling in the splendour.
"Where did you even find stuff like this?" Ari asked. "The headphones are incredible. I can hear things in my music I never noticed before."
"We went to make a deal with an electronics company. The gifts were one of the perks of the business trip. You should see the laptop I got out of it. It makes all your gifts look modest in comparison," Jay explained, stretching the truth only slightly.
"No way. What kind of laptop?" Tim asked. 
Jay glanced at the sleek machine sitting on his table, still barely touched. "Top of the line everything. More processing power than I'll ever need."
"That's so cool," Ari said, then his voice turned hesitant. "Um, Jay? What are you going to do with your old laptop?"
Jay looked at his faithful college computer, battered and slow but still functional. The idea of throwing it away had been bothering him for days. "Why do you ask?"
"Well, Mom and Dad won't buy me one, and Tim won't share his. I was just wondering..."
Jay thought about it for a moment. The old machine had served him well through college and his early working years. Maybe a few more years of heavy use by his youngest brother wasn't a bad retirement strategy. At least his hard work from college would be properly utilized.
"Alright. I'll make arrangements to send it to you."
Ari's screech of joy was so loud Jay had to hold the phone away from his ear.
"Really? You're serious?"
"Yes, but you have to promise to take good care of it. And help with homework, not just games."
"I promise! I promise everything!"
"I'll get it shipped next week."
They talked for another half hour, with Jay sharing edited stories from his trip while his siblings asked him questions. By the time they hung up, the stress had started to lift and Jay finally smiled.
The gym felt foreign after more than a week away. Jay approached the front desk with the resignation, expecting punishment.
"Look what the cat dragged in," Rus called from across the floor. "I was starting to think you'd found a new trainer."
"I told you this would happen."
Rus crossed his arms, his expression stern but concerned. "A week and a half, Jay. That's not a missed session, that's abandoning your routine entirely."
"I know, I know. But please be gentle today. I just survived the worst quarter of my career and I'm practically on death's door."
"That bad?"
"Worse. I worked seven days straight, slept maybe four hours a night, and lived on coffee and whatever food got delivered to the office."
"Jesus. Alright, we'll take it easy today. But only because you look like hell."
"I feel like hell."
"When's the last time you ate a real meal?"
Jay had to think about it. "Thursday? Maybe Wednesday."
"Right. Light workout today, and I'm writing you a meal plan. You can't maintain any kind of fitness routine if you're going to crash your system every three months."
The workout was mercifully basic, but even the simple movements felt awkward after days of hunching over computers. Jay's body protested every move, reminding him of how completely he had neglected everything outside of work.
"This is exactly why consistency matters," Rus observed as Jay struggled with a basic stretch.
"I know. It won't happen again."
"It will, though. That's the problem."
Jay couldn't argue with that assessment. "Just four times a year."
"That's four times too many if you ask me."
Jay spent the rest of the weekend on basic maintenance. He did laundry, grocery shopping, and the minimum household chores necessary to function. The remainder of the time he was horizontal on his couch, catching up on sleep and trying to process the emotional exhaustion that had accumulated during the week. By Sunday evening, he felt better.
He returned to an office that felt subdued, almost shell-shocked, on Monday morning. His colleagues moved through their tasks with sluggishly, still recovering from the trauma. 
Jay threw himself into the fallout from the quarterly reports, minor corrections to submitted documents, the inevitable cleanup that always followed such intense periods. But he was distracted, going through the motions while struggling to focus.
By seven o'clock, the office had emptied except for Jay, who was still working through a backlog of administrative tasks. Outside, the autumn darkness had set in, making the building feel isolated.
"Working late again?"
Jay looked up to see Ian approaching with two cups of coffee.
"Just catching up on things that got pushed aside last week."
Ian sat on the chair next to Jay's desk and set one of the coffee cups within Jay's reach. "I brought reinforcements. Everything alright?"
Jay stared at his computer screen for a moment before answering. "Nothing's wrong, exactly. The opposite, actually. Things are good. The week was brutal, but apart from that, I don't really have anything to complain about. I feel confident, hopeful about the future."
"That sounds positive."
"It is. Which is precisely the problem. Every time I've felt this way before, something happened to put me back in my place. So I guess I'm just bracing for impact, trying not to get too comfortable with feeling good about myself."
"Failure is part of life, especially in an environment like this. I can't promise things will never go wrong again, because they almost certainly will."
Jay's shoulders sagged slightly.
"But," Ian continued, "you already know you can survive setbacks. You've done it multiple times, and you get better at handling them each time. Look at where you are now compared to when you started here. That progression isn't coincidence or luck. You seized every opportunity. Don't forget that, even when things get difficult."
"You have more faith in me than I have in myself."
"I have a clearer perspective. You're too close to your own struggles to see how consistently you overcome them."
Jay felt some of the tension in his chest ease. "Thank you. I needed to hear that."
The following weeks, Jay focused on preparation. He resumed his pool sessions and finished the diving course. Ina put him through increasingly complex scenarios, building his confidence for the trip ahead.
"You're ready. The open water will be different, but you have all the skills you need."
"I hope so. It still feels surreal that I'm actually doing this."
"Best way to conquer fear is to walk straight through it."
At the gym, Rus gradually rebuilt Jay's routine, though he remained skeptical about the sustainability of the schedule.
"You're making good progress," Rus admitted, "but what happens during the next quarterly crisis?"
"I'll try to maintain some kind of routine. Maybe shorter sessions, but something."
"We'll see."
Jay also finally transferred his data to the new laptop, a process that took an entire evening and left him impressed by the machine's capabilities. When he packaged up his college laptop to send to Ari, he felt like he was saying goodbye to an era of his life.
The occasional overtime resumed, but at manageable levels, and the evening conversations with Ian became a regular feature again.
They would meet in the small kitchen area around six o'clock, both making their final coffee of the day while discussing everything from work challenges to random observations about city life.
"Doesn't the caffeine keep you awake?" Ian asked one evening as Jay prepared his beverage.
"I'm usually so tired I fall asleep immediately anyway."
"Are you pushing yourself too hard? I don't want you burning out."
"I don't think so. This feels sustainable, unlike the quarterly madness. I can handle the regular workload."
"Good. Because I'd rather have you working at eighty percent indefinitely than at one hundred percent until you collapse."
Jay felt a warmth that had nothing to do with the coffee. "I'm not pushing myself too hard."
"I'm glad to hear it."
As his departure date approached, Jay realized he felt as ready as he could possibly be. The diving skills were as solid as they could be and his documents were in order. Most importantly, he was returning to something good when he came back. It was a decent foundation to build from, and Jay allowed himself to believe it might last.
Scene 5
Vacation
On Friday afternoon, as Jay made his rounds with final farewells, a surprising warmth spread through the office. He had expected polite wishes for a good trip, but instead got enveloped in a series of embraces.
Max was the first to pull him into a hearty hug. "Don't do anything too adventurous down there. We need you back in one piece."
"I'll try to keep the sharks at bay," Jay replied, surprised by how natural the embrace felt.
Amy followed suit. "Can't believe you're actually doing this. Solo diving trip to the tropics. Very impressive."
Luc's hug lasted longer than the others. "You better come back in one piece, Hall. I've gotten used to having someone competent around here."
"I'll do my best."
"See that you do."
Zoe approached with a warm smile and a folded piece of paper. "This is everything you absolutely must do while you're there," she said, pressing the list into his hands along with a brief hug. "Rent an underwater camera for photos, and try to spot parrotfish if you can. Oh, and remember to equalize frequently during descents. Some people forget when they're excited."
Jay unfolded the list, finding detailed diving tips and marine life recommendations. "This is incredibly thoughtful. Thank you."
"You're going to love it."
His final conversation of the day took place in Ian's office, where Jay knocked on the doorframe in the late afternoon light.
"Do you have a moment?"
Ian looked up from his computer, immediately giving Jay his full attention. "Of course. All set for your adventure?"
"I think so. Triple-checked everything. What about your plans? A whole week off must feel strange."
"Nothing specific. Might visit some old friends, catch up on reading."
The vague response felt deliberate, but Jay didn't press. "That sounds nice. Relaxing."
"Exactly."
In reality, Ian had no plans at all. A week without Jay was an ordeal to be endured, not an enjoyable vacation. But sharing that information seemed inappropriate, potentially burdensome.
Both were aware that this was goodbye for more than a week. Jay was reluctant to leave, wanted to extend the conversation indefinitely. Ian seemed similarly hesitant to bring their time to a close.
"You should get home and finish packing," Ian said finally.
"Right. Early flight tomorrow."
"I want you to be careful out there. Follow the safety protocols, don't take unnecessary risks."
"I won't. Ina drilled proper procedures into me pretty thoroughly."
Jay wanted to say something meaningful, to acknowledge how much these conversations had come to mean to him, but the words felt too large.
Ian got up, coming around his desk. For a moment they stood facing each other, closer than their normal interactions required. Jay wanted to offer some physical gesture of farewell, and from Ian's expression, the impulse was mutual.
But the office setting, the uncertainty of what such a gesture might mean or imply, created a barrier that neither could cross. They stood awkwardly, both wanting something they couldn't name or claim.
"Have a wonderful trip," Ian said.
"Thank you. I'll see you when I get back."
Jay forced himself to turn and walk away, fighting the urge to look back as he headed for the elevator. Behind him, Ian remained standing in his office doorway until the elevator doors closed.
Jay woke up on Saturday morning at five-thirty, with his alarm still an hour away. He lay in bed for a moment, acknowledging that further sleep was impossible. The night was restless. Every half hour brought him bolt upright, checking his phone, then lying back down to repeat the process.
Finally he got up to begin his final preparations. Coffee first, strong and black to cut through the fog of exhaustion. Then a shower to wake himself up properly. One final review of his documents, passport, tickets, diving certification cards.
Everything was exactly as he had left it the night before, and the night before that, and every night for the past week.
The public transport to the airport felt surreal, a ordinary commute that was taking him toward an extraordinary personal milestone. He watched other passengers, wondering who else might be embarking on solo adventures, who else might be pushing past their comfort zones into unknown territory.
The airport was less intimidating than expected. His early arrival gave him ample time to get through check-in and security, and he located his gate without difficulty. The four-hour flight in economy class was cramped compared to his recent experience with Ian, but tolerable. More importantly, flying no longer frightened him the way it once had.
When they landed in Lagoon Belt, humid, flower-scented air rushed in and the immediate disorientation of being somewhere completely foreign set in. The taxi ride to his hotel provided glimpses of palm trees and an ocean bluer than any body of water he had ever seen.
The hotel staff greeted him, providing pamphlets about local activities and evening entertainment options. 
"Welcome party starts at seven. Great way to meet your fellow divers," the desk clerk informed him cheerfully. 
Jay thanked her and went to his room to unpack and try to calm his nerves. He spread the materials across his bed, suddenly overwhelmed by having to be responsible for his own itinerary in a place where he knew no one.
The party was larger and livelier than Jay expected. He wore his resort wear from the company retreat, feeling slightly overdressed. The gathering happened across a beachside terrace, with music, local cuisine, and an abundance of alcohol that quickly loosened tongues and inhibitions.
Jay positioned himself near the edge of the crowd, holding a beer and trying to blend into the background. His strategy worked until a boisterous instructor spotted him.
"First time diving in tropical waters?" he asked, sitting beside Jay without invitation.
"Second, but it's my first time diving solo."
"Excellent! I'm Ash, I'll be your instructor. You're going to love it out there. The visibility is incredible, and we've got some fantastic coral formations. Have you seen many tropical fish before? The variety here is amazing. There's a resident green moray that likes to hang out near the drop-off..."
Ash launched into an enthusiastic monologue about local marine life and diving conditions that lasted nearly two hours. Jay was content to listen, asking occasional questions that kept Ash talking while requiring minimal participation on his own part. The arrangement suited them both: Ash had an attentive audience, and Jay could participate socially without the pressure of carrying conversation.
By ten o'clock, travel fatigue was weighing heavily on Jay's eyelids. He made his excuses, weathering Ash's protests about leaving early.
"Come on, the night's just getting started! This is when the real stories come out!"
"I'm sure they do, but I'm completely exhausted. Long day of travel."
"Alright, alright. Tomorrow we dive, so rest up. You'll need your energy."
Jay retreated to his room, showered quickly, and went into bed, falling asleep instantly. 
On Sunday morning, Jay encountered a truly tropical environment. He walked the hotel grounds in wonder, marvelling at palm trees, white sand, and water in shades of turquoise and deep blue.
The ocean here was different from the seaside of his country in every way. Where home waters were cold and grey-green, these were warm and brilliantly coloured, with beaches that stretched for miles and waves that crashed with impressive force.
Jay spread his towel on the hot sand and lay back, enjoying the morning breeze. His mind felt completely quiet, freed from the constant undercurrent of work concerns and personal anxieties.
His first dive happened in the early afternoon. Jay had expected more nerves, but descending into the warm, clear water felt natural after the months of pool training. His small group of fellow novices moved clumsily at first, but Ash's patient guidance and the forgiving conditions made the experience enjoyable.
Swimming among fish, seeing coral formations, Jay felt a sense of accomplishment. This was purely personal, a goal he had set and achieved entirely for himself.
Later that afternoon, he explored the nearby town, a collection of old continent architecture that seemed transported from another era. At the post office, he selected postcards for his siblings and, on impulse, one for the office. The messages were brief: "Weather beautiful, diving amazing, wish you were here."
The evening's congratulatory dinner celebrating everyone's successful first dive was loud as alcohol flowed. Jay participated enough to be sociable but excused himself early, claiming exhaustion that was entirely real.
The rest of the week moved along in a similar pattern. Morning dives or afternoon sessions, depending on conditions and scheduling. Beach time when he wasn't underwater, either sunbathing or swimming in the ocean. Evening walks around the hotel grounds, appreciating the tropical flowers and the sound of waves.
The diving itself was easier than expected. His technique improved each day, and his confidence in the underwater environment grew. Jay's photos weren't particularly good, but they captured enough of the experience to serve as meaningful reminders.
Ash remained his primary social contact, still as talkative and outgoing as ever, but his attention was distributed among all the guests. Most other participants were couples or friend groups, and the few solo travellers like himself seemed content with their own company.
Jay attended enough group activities to be polite but skipped most evening parties in favour of solitary pursuits. Walks, meals at the hotel restaurant, sightseeing the local town. It suited his temperament perfectly.
By week's end, he had earned his open water certification and accumulated a collection of small souvenirs: local snacks, postcards, a few pieces of simple jewelry that caught his eye. More importantly, he had proven to himself that solo travel was not only survivable but enjoyable.
The return journey felt both too soon and perfectly timed. Jay was tanned, thoroughly exercised from daily diving and swimming, and content with his week. As the plane lifted off from Lagoon Belt, he thought about Ian's vacation, wondering if it had been equally restorative.
The thought led to a comparison between this trip and his recent travels with Ian. Both had been successful in their own ways, but the company retreat and New Continent trip had felt more significant, more memorable. Perhaps because they had been shared experiences, or perhaps because Ian had made every moment feel special.
This vacation had been good for him. But he was glad to be returning home.
Jay got back to his apartment on Saturday evening, and spent Sunday unpacking, sorting clothes for laundry and redistributing items among his collection of suitcases. The tropical warmth was already a memory as chilly November air crept through his windows. Halloween had passed entirely unnoticed while he was away, and evening was falling with the early darkness of approaching winter.
None of the seasonal transition bothered him. The overcast skies and cooling temperatures felt refreshing. He was back in the city that had become his own, in the life he had built for himself. 
Jay finished his unpacking, already looking forward to Monday morning. He was home. Or rather, he would be home tomorrow, right where he belonged: in front of Ian's office, ready to resume their shared work.

Chapter 26: Uncharted territories
Scene 1
Return
Jay pushed through the building's glass doors at exactly seven-thirty Monday morning, his steps quickening as he approached the elevator. Returning to work felt like slipping into comfortable clothes after a week of formal attire. But it wasn't the office itself that drew him forward with such anticipation.
The elevator doors opened to reveal the thirty-fourth floor, most desks still empty, computers dark. But through the glass wall of Ian's office, Jay could see exactly what he had hoped for: Ian already at his desk, immaculately dressed, his blonde hair perfectly styled, completely absorbed in reading a document.
A wave of blissful calm washed over him, so profound it stopped him mid-step. The vacation had been wonderful, the diving exhilarating, the warm beaches restorative, but none of it compared to this moment of seeing Ian in his natural environment, focused and commanding and absolutely perfect. Nothing brought Jay the deep contentment he felt simply looking at Ian again.
Jay stood frozen for a moment, drinking in the sight with fresh eyes. Everything about Ian seemed more vivid after a week away: the lines of his face, the elegance of his movements as he turned pages. Being close to him again felt like coming home in the truest sense.
Jay felt even more awestruck than during their first meeting, when Ian had been too intimidating to properly appreciate. Now that same perfection felt comforting, like the fixed point around which everything else in his life had learned to orbit.
Jay moved to his own desk, unpacking his bag and powering up his computer. When he glanced up to see Ian setting aside his document and stretching slightly, Jay didn't hesitate.
He knocked on Ian's door frame. "Good morning."
Ian's face softened the moment he saw Jay. "Jay. Welcome back. How was the trip?"
"Incredible." Jay stepped into the office, closing the door behind him out of habit and sitting in the chair in front of Ian's desk. The early morning privacy felt precious, a gift of uninterrupted time together.  "The diving was everything I hoped it would be. Got my open water certification, saw some amazing marine life. The water was so clear you could see thirty meters in any direction."
"The diving went well then?"
"Better than I hoped. I actually felt competent by the end. It's amazing how different it feels when you're not fighting panic."
"You look well. Rested."
"I feel good. It was exactly what I needed."
"I'm glad to hear it. Thank you for the postcard."
Jay followed Ian's gesture toward the calendar on his desk, where his tropical postcard was pinned among important dates and meeting reminders. It made his heart flutter, but he tried not to show it. He hadn't expected Ian to display it so publicly.
"What about your time off? Did you manage to do anything interesting?" Jay asked.
"Not much, really. Catching up on personal matters."
"Come on, you had a full week. You must have done something besides household chores."
"I drove to see some old university friends and did some walking around the old campus. Nothing too exciting."
Jay sensed something held back in Ian's response, but the details mattered less than the reassurance that Ian had taken time for himself. "I'm glad you did something relaxing. You work too hard."
"Pot calling the kettle black," Ian replied with a crooked smile.
"Fair point." Jay got up, recognizing that other staff would begin arriving soon and their private time would end. "I should let you get back to your reading. I've got a pile of November assignments waiting."
"It's good to have you back, Jay."
"It's good to be back."
Ian watched Jay return to his desk through his office window, while his heart performed acrobatics that would have been embarrassing in a teenager, let alone a thirty-nine-year-old executive.
Seeing Jay again had unlocked something in his chest that he had spent a week trying to suppress. Jay looked radiant and happy, and it made Ian's emotional walls feel like tissue paper. The tan suited him, and there was an ease in his movements that made him look even more alluring.
Ian had arrived at the office at six-thirty, telling himself it was to catch up on work that had accumulated during his absence. The real reason was more pathetic: he wanted to maximize every possible moment with Jay, and arriving early meant an extra hour of shared space before their colleagues arrived to dilute his attention.
When he had found Jay's postcard in his mail pile, the phrase "wish you were here" had made his heart leap with ridiculous hope. He knew it was standard postcard language, meaningless and automatic. But he had pinned it to his calendar anyway, and spent far too much time staring at Jay's handwriting and imagining what it would mean if those words were honest.
Now Jay was here, and Ian could finally breathe properly again. He hadn't fully recognized how suffocating the week without him had been until it ended.
He had lied about his vacation. There had been no friends, no social catching up. He had driven to his university town alone, seeking distraction from the constant ache of Jay's absence. He had walked the streets, sat in cafes where he had once studied, visited the library where he had spent countless hours as a student.
The melancholy hadn't provided the escape he had hoped for. Instead, it had brought clarity. There was no point in fighting the current. He was in love with Jay and no amount of emotional discipline was going to change that reality.
What he could control was how he handled that love. He would find ways to spend time with Jay without making him uncomfortable. He would provide support and mentorship and whatever else Jay needed, regardless of how inappropriate his motivations might be. He would cross whatever lines necessary to ensure Jay felt valued and secure. He was done pretending that spending time with Jay wasn't the driving force behind most of his decisions.
It wasn't a sustainable long-term strategy, but it was all he had. And watching Jay sit back at his desk, organize his files, Ian decided this was what he wanted. Having Jay here, under his care, was worth whatever personal cost it demanded.
The elevator chimed, signaling the arrival of their first colleague. Their private time was ending, but Jay was back, and that was everything Ian needed to face another day of pretending. He turned back to his documents, already planning how to create more opportunities for their conversations.
The office filled around eight-thirty, and the morning's peace gave way to the bustle of a workday. Jay told stories about his trip, particularly to Zoe.
"Did you see any parrotfish? They're incredible to watch when they're feeding on coral."
"Several different species. And the photos I took don't do them justice, but I managed to capture a few decent shots."
"The underwater camera worked well then?"
"Better than expected. I was worried I'd be too clumsy with the controls, but it became easier after the first few dives."
Luc appeared beside them. "Look at you, all tanned and seasoned. Like a proper adventurer instead of our pale office drone."
For once, the comment about his appearance didn't make Jay self-conscious. "I do feel different. More capable, maybe."
"It shows. You look like someone who conquered something important."
"I did. The whole solo travel thing felt impossible when I first started planning it, but by the end I was enjoying the independence."
"Good for you. Nothing like proving to yourself you can handle whatever you set your mind to."
Luc was right. Jay had proven something important to himself during the past week, and returning to the office felt like bringing that new confidence with him.
Scene 2
Evening chat
Lunch at the nearby restaurant became an extended celebration of Jay's successful diving adventure. Luc and Zoe flanked him at their table, asking follow-up questions that kept the conversation animated throughout the meal.
"So the visibility was really that clear? You could see the bottom even at fifteen meters?" Zoe asked.
"Crystal clear. Like swimming in an aquarium, except everything was real and alive. The fish weren't afraid of divers at all. Some of them would swim right up to the camera. The colours were so much more vivid in person."
Zoe nodded knowingly. "The camera never captures it properly. That's why I always tell people the real experience is worth ten times more than any documentation."
Jay talked eagerly, the memory of his adventure still fresh enough to spark excitement. Both his colleagues seemed pleased by his enthusiasm, asking detailed questions about the specific dive sites he had visited.
The afternoon passed productively as Jay worked through his post-vacation backlog, but it was the late coffee break that made an ordinary day more memorable. What started as a brief kitchen encounter stretched into an extended conversation that seemed to take on a life of its own. Jay sat at the tall stool by the window table while Ian stood against the wall, both of them quickly getting lost in the discussion.
"The solitary walks were my favourite part. There's something exhilarating about exploring a new place entirely at your own pace, following whatever catches your interest."
"That sounds appealing. No schedules, no obligations to anyone else's preferences."
"Yeah. I'd wander into the town in the evenings, just observing how different everything felt. The architecture, the way people moved, even the quality of light was different."
Ian asked questions that drew out more details, seeming interested in Jay's observations about cultural differences and the contrast between tropical warmth and their current November chill.
"Coming back to falling leaves and cold mornings was jarring. Though not unpleasant. Just a reminder that I need to get serious about practical things again," Jay admitted.
"Such as?"
"The apartment search, mainly. I've been putting it off, but with winter coming and my living situation getting more cramped by the month, I really need to focus on finding something better."
"Have you started looking at specific units?"
"Not really. I keep telling myself I'll start, but then work gets busy or I get distracted by other things."
"What kind of space are you hoping to find?"
"Something larger, obviously. Maybe a proper bedroom instead of just a studio layout. Better kitchen facilities would be nice too. I've gotten tired of cooking everything in a single small pan."
Ian asked about Jay's timeline, his budget and commute considerations, discussed the neighbourhood characteristics and the pros and cons of older buildings versus modern construction, and Jay elaborated on details he hadn't fully articulated to himself before. Ian's questions prompted Jay to explore his own thoughts about what kind of home he wanted to create.
Finally Jay checked his watch and discovered with surprise that nearly an hour had passed. "I should probably get back to work though. I was hoping to make more progress on the backlog tonight."
"Of course. Though it was good to hear about your trip in detail."
Jay returned to his desk energized by the unexpected conversation. The tasks felt less tedious, and they continued to work until nearly ten o'clock. It wasn't strictly necessary, the backlog could have easily waited until tomorrow. But the shared late-evening felt less like work and more like a long awaited social call. As they finally prepared to leave, Jay hadn't minded the extended hours at all. If anything, the evening had felt too short.
Tuesday evening was Ian's least favourite part of Jay's weekly routine. At exactly five o'clock, Jay began shutting down his computer and gathering his belongings.
"Gym night?" Ian asked, though he already knew the answer.
"Six o'clock session with Rus. Haven't seen him since before the vacation, so I'm expecting some commentary about my tan."
Ian managed what he hoped was an appropriately encouraging smile. "I'm sure he'll be pleased you stayed active during your time away."
"We'll see. He tends to find something to critique regardless."
Jay headed home to change, leaving Ian alone in the office with his increasingly irrational resentment toward a personal trainer he had never met. The logical part of his mind recognized that Jay's fitness routine was healthy and important, that Rus was helping Jay build physical strength that benefited every aspect of his life.
The less logical part wanted to throttle anyone who commanded Jay's time and attention outside of work hours.
Ian sat in his office, staring at nothing in particular, contemplating his emotions. He needed Jay closer, in every possible sense. The apartment search Jay had mentioned presented an opportunity, and Ian was already mentally reviewing his contacts in real estate circles.
It was manipulative, he knew that. Jay deserved to find housing based on his own preferences and needs, not Ian's desire to engineer proximity. But helping someone find a better living situation was hardly villainous, even if his motives were entirely selfish.
He wouldn't coerce Jay into anything he didn't want. But perhaps he could ensure that Jay's options included some attractive possibilities in neighbourhoods that happened to be convenient to Ian's own life. Surely there were agents who valued his gratitude above strict profit considerations.
At the gym, Jay threw himself into his workout with vigour. Rus looked at him with approval.
"You look healthy. The week away obviously agreed with you."
"I stayed more active than I expected. Lots of swimming and walking."
"Good. Vacations are important, but I was worried you'd come back completely deconditioned. How do you feel? Any lingering fatigue from the travel?"
"I feel great. More energetic than before I left."
"That's what a proper break should do. Your body had time to recover from all that work stress."
The session proceeded smoothly, with Jay finding his strength and endurance largely intact. After he was done, Rus praised both his consistency and his approach to maintaining fitness during travel.
"You're turning into a real athlete. Remember when you first came in here, all nervous and apologetic about everything?"
Jay laughed, toweling off his face. "I was convinced I'd embarrass myself completely."
"Now look at you. Confident, strong, adventurous.  You're almost unrecognizable after less than six months."
On his way home, Jay stopped at Café Lemon, craving the comfort of the place after a good workout. The evening shift usually meant Fay would be behind the counter, but tonight a different barista greeted him.
"Is Fay not working tonight?" Jay asked as he ordered hot chocolate.
"She's been out sick for a few days. Flu season's hitting everyone early this year."
Jay accepted his drink with disappointment. Fay had become part of the cafe's charm, and her absence made it feel slightly less congenial. Still, the atmosphere remained welcoming, and he had time to sit and enjoy the ambience properly.
As he sipped his drink, Jay made a mental note to schedule his flu vaccination soon. The last thing he wanted was to repeat last winter's bout of illness, especially with the apartment search ahead.
There was a sharp chill in the air as Jay walked home from the café, a reminder that winter was approaching fast. He reheated leftover curry and, on impulse, decided to call his family. The guilt about the curt dismissal during the quarterly reports had been nagging at him since the last time he spoke to them.
"So tell us everything. Your postcard made it sound incredible," his mother's voice came through clearly as the family gathered around their phone. 
Jay launched into a story of his adventures, focusing on the diving experiences and cultural observations while ignoring the more solitary aspects of his vacation.
"It sounds like exactly what you needed. You seem more relaxed," his mother said warmly.
"I feel it too. Though I'm back to reality now. Long hours supporting my boss through the busy periods."
"This boss of yours. You always talk about him with such... admiration. Is he really as wonderful as you make him sound?" Ema interjected with obvious curiosity.
Jay felt heat rise in his cheeks, though thankfully no one could see his reaction. "Ian is... yes, he really amazing. The best person I've ever worked for, probably the best person I know."
"He must be something special to earn that kind of loyalty from you."
"He very much is the greatest," Jay said simply, meaning every word.
The call ended with promises to stay in better touch. As he hung up, Jay thought he had missed the uncomplicated comfort of family connection. Outside, the November wind rattled his windows, but Jay felt unusually warm.
Scene 3
Planning activities
The rest of the week was filled with overtime as lingering issues from their time off surfaced alongside some procedural complications. Nothing required emergency treatment or the full team's attention, but enough accumulated to keep Jay consistently busy past normal hours.
Their evening coffee conversations continued, though briefer than Monday's extended discussion. By Thursday, they were wrapping up work closer to eight o'clock, without the marathon sessions that characterized crisis situations.
Colleagues gathered their belongings and made weekend plans on Friday afternoon, when Luc appeared at Jay's desk with his customary invitation.
"Drinks tonight? That new place downtown has decent cocktails and terrible music, which is somehow exactly what I need right now."
Jay shook his head apologetically. "Can't tonight. Ian and I are staying late to deal with a compliance request."
"You know, you could occasionally prioritize fun over paperwork."
Jay was about to deflect with an excuse when Luc's expression turned more pointed.
"Speaking of fun, remember when you got back from your business trip? You were feeling all confident and proposed we do something different and exciting to cheer me up after the Cam situation?"
Jay felt his stomach drop slightly. He had completely forgotten making that promise, though he vaguely recalled feeling uncharacteristically bold about social planning during those post-trip days.
"Right," Jay said carefully. "That."
"I'm holding you to it. I've been patient, but it's time to deliver on your mysterious plans."
"Of course. I'll... think of something."
Luc grinned and headed toward the elevator, leaving Jay to contemplate his complete lack of ideas about novel entertainment options.
The compliance issue was less time-consuming than anticipated, and by six o'clock they had resolved it entirely. Instead of heading to the kitchen for the coffee, Jay knocked on Ian's office door.
"Do you have a minute? I need some advice about something non-work related."
"What's on your mind?"
"I promised Luc I'll organize something fun and different for him when I was feeling confident after our trip. Well, I completely forgot about it until today, and he's calling it in. I have absolutely no idea what constitutes fun and different entertainment. My idea of leisure is reading at home."
"What kind of activity are you thinking? Something active, social, cultural?"
"I honestly don't know. Something that would cheer him up and get him away from the Friday night bar routine."
"Fencing," Ian said.
"I'm sorry, what?"
"Fencing. It's unusual, physically engaging, and most people find it surprisingly enjoyable once they try it."
Jay began laughing at the complete unexpectedness of the suggestion. "That's completely bonkers. Are you seriously suggesting I invite Luc to hit people with swords?"
"It's more sophisticated than that, but essentially yes. I tried it briefly in college. It can be quite enjoyable. Good exercise, requires focus and strategy."
"That's..." Jay paused, still grinning. "That's completely unorthodox. Where did that even come from?"
"I'm not exactly known for spontaneous entertainment planning. If you want truly creative ideas, you'd probably need to consult actual experts in that area."
"Who would those experts be?"
"Leo, obviously. He has extensive experience organizing social activities."
The mention of Leo's name immediately dampened Jay's mood. Ian noticed the change immediately. "Are you still resentful about the tailor appointment?"
"I'm resentful about everything," Jay replied sulkily.
"He can be mischievous, I'll grant you that. But his intentions are good, and he does tend to have excellent ideas for entertainment. He knows how to create memorable experiences."
Jay remained unconvinced. "I'd rather have nothing to do with Leo at all. Maybe I'll actually do the fencing thing instead."
The defeat in his voice was obvious, and Ian felt a little guilty for not being more helpful.
"Since it's Friday and we've finished the urgent matters, should we call it a day? You've been putting in long hours all week, and proper rest is beneficial," Jay asked, suddenly eager to change the subject.
Ian wanted nothing more than to stay longer, to find excuses that would extend their time together before the weekend separated them entirely. But he knew it was unfair to keep Jay at work solely for his own emotional needs.
"You're right. It has been a long week."
They gathered their things and headed for the elevator together, with Ian concealing his disappointment at ending what could have been at least two more hours of shared work.
Jay spent the evening researching fencing options on his new laptop. To his surprise, he discovered several beginner-friendly facilities offering group packages designed for people with no experience.
One option caught his attention: "introductory combat sports for absolute beginners", that promised to accommodate complete novices with safety equipment and patient instructors. Without overthinking the absolute absurdity of what he was doing, Jay booked it for the following Friday afternoon.
The rest of the weekend passed on exercise, walks, and household maintenance. He also spent time browsing apartment listings, though his home internet made the process frustratingly slow. Even the powerful new laptop couldn't compensate for the sluggish connection, and Jay stared at the machine with guilt.
"You're really wasted on someone like me," he said aloud to the laptop, unable to shake the sense that he wasn't utilizing such an expensive gift properly. He compiled a list of potential viewings with the intention of calling agents during the upcoming week, finally ready to take his housing search seriously.
When Luc joined him for coffee on Monday morning, Jay decided to address the entertainment situation directly.
"I booked an activity for Friday."
Luc's interest immediately sparked. "Really? What kind of activity?"
"Fencing."
Luc's face went through several expressions in rapid succession. "You want us to hit each other with swords?"
"More like poke each other with sticks, from what I understand. But yes, basically. I booked a group package, so we can invite the rest of the team or you could bring your flatmates or other friends."
"You know what? I'd rather keep this separate from work. Make it a purely social thing. I'll bring my flatmates, but you need to bring people too. How many spots do we have?"
"I... don't really have other friends to invite."
"Come on, there must be someone."
"I'll figure something out," Jay promised, though he had no idea how.
The solution presented itself unexpectedly on Tuesday afternoon at the gym. As Jay finished his session, he approached Rus with what felt like a ridiculous request.
"This might sound strange, but would you be interested in joining me and some friends for a... recreational activity this Friday?"
"What kind of activity?"
"Fencing. Like, with swords."
Rus's face lit up with unexpected enthusiasm. "Are you serious? That sounds amazing! I've always wanted to try melee combat sports."
"Really?"
"Absolutely. How many people can you bring?"
"Three spots available."
"Perfect. I'll bring a couple of friends. What's your number? I'll coordinate with my guys," Rus was already pulling out his phone. 
They exchanged contact information, and Jay provided the details, relieved by Rus's eagerness.
"This is going to be amazing. You're full of surprises, Jay."
The turn of events felt surreal—Jay was apparently developing an actual friendship with his trainer and committing to an evening of recreational sword fighting.
On Wednesday morning Jay informed Luc that their social experiment was officially happening. His response was suspiciously militant.
"Wait, so now we have two teams? Your gym friends versus my flatmates?"
"I suppose that's one way to look at it."
"This just became a lot more interesting. We have to make it a proper competition now."
Jay watched Luc's growing excitement with mounting anxiety. What had started as a desperate attempt to fulfil a forgotten promise was evolving into something much more elaborate than he had ever intended.
During their evening coffee in the kitchen, Jay confessed his growing anxiety to Ian while slumping slightly in his chair by the kitchen window.
"I've created a monster. What started as a simple activity has turned into a competitive social event, and now I feel completely foolish about the whole enterprise."
Ian regarded him with an expressions that Jay couldn't quite parse. "Why foolish?"
"Because it's absurd. I don't know anything about fencing, I barely know Luc's friends, and I'm about to spend an evening watching people hit each other with medieval weapons because I couldn't think of anything better."
"It sounds like you've successfully organized the novel entertainment Luc was hoping for."
"I've never held a sword in my life, and now I'm apparently leading a team into recreational combat."
Ian's response was solemn. "You'll have to endure it for the sake of your heartbroken colleague. Perhaps take a few hits for the cause."
Jay rolled his eyes dramatically. "You're enjoying my suffering. Heartless."
"I prefer to think of it as character building through adversity."
“Absolutely heartless,” Jay repeated, pouting as he returned to his desk with a defeated posture.
Thursday morning at ten o'clock, during a lull in the office coffee rotation, Jay finally made the calls he had been postponing. He contacted several real estate agents and scheduled apartment viewings for the following week. Time to get serious about the apartment search, he thought. But first, he needed to survive Friday's fencing adventure.
Scene 4
Melee combat
Jay rushed home from work on Friday, barely managing to change clothes and grab a quick dinner before meeting his team at the designated spot near the gym. He had arranged to meet Rus and his friends at six-thirty, allowing time to get acquainted before the main event.
The taxi ride to the fencing studio provided Jay's first proper introduction to Rus's companions. Mic, another trainer from the same gym, was someone Jay recognized from brief glimpses during his sessions, stocky and obviously strong, with a confident bearing. Van was more intimidating, tall enough that he had to fold himself into the taxi and built like he could lift a car if necessary.
"So how do you know Rus?" Jay asked.
"Mic and I met at the gym. Van and I go way back. We're military buddies," Rus explained. 
"Military? I had no idea."
Van grinned. "Yeah, Rus never mentions it because it was boring as hell. All that training and we never got to use any proper melee weapons. Biggest disappointment of his military career."
"That's why tonight is going to be perfect. Finally get to swing some steel around," Rus added with enthusiasm.
They arrived at the fencing studio to find Luc and his flatmates already waiting outside, and Luc's excitement was immediately evident.
"There they are! Ready for battle?" Luc called out as they approached.
Jay was introduced to three young men who had the bearing of people accustomed to success. Roc, Gav, and Lim, though Jay suspected he would struggle to keep their names straight, all seemed excited about the prospect of recreational combat.
Within minutes of entering the studio, Jay discovered that his role as organizer was entirely superfluous. The two groups converged on the staff, quickly establishing the parameters of their competition while Jay watched with growing bemusement.
"Team competition, losers buy drinks for the winners all evening," Luc declared, and both sides agreed immediately.
Jay's heart sank when one of Luc's flatmates mentioned having done fencing in college.
"I promise I'll cover any costs we incur tonight," Jay said quietly to Rus. "I don't want your friends dealing with unexpected expenses because of my idea."
"Nonsense," Rus replied confidently. "We're going to destroy them. Van here is a natural athlete, and I've got strategy."
The instructor provided basic safety equipment and fundamental techniques, but it quickly became clear that both teams were more interested in competition. Soon they were facing off in proper duels, with everyone fighting everyone else across sixteen total matches.
Jay's performance was spectacularly abysmal. He lost every single match, often within the first thirty seconds, completely outclassed by opponents who grasped the basics far more quickly than he did. His sword work resembled flailing more than fencing, and by his fourth consecutive defeat, he had accepted his role as the evening's primary source of entertainment.
However, the rest of his team was devastatingly effective. Mic and Rus, despite being complete beginners, adapted quickly to the sport's demands. Van emerged as an absolute phenomenon, his combination of reach, speed, and tactical thinking making him unbeatable. Even Lim, with his college experience, only managed victory against Mic and Rus, while losing to Van.
When the scores were tallied, Jay's team had won decisively despite his perfect losing record. Luc's team looked shell-shocked by the defeat, though they maintained good humour about their poor performance.
"At least Jay was worse than all of us," Luc said consolingly to his flatmates. "That's something."
Jay accepted this dubious distinction with grace, pleased that everyone else seemed to be enjoying themselves despite the lopsided results.
The promised drinks at a nearby pub were more enjoyable than the fencing itself. Luc and his friends honoured their agreement to cover the tab, and the evening turned into boisterous storytelling about the night's more memorable moments.
"Did you see Luc trip over his own feet fighting Van?" Gav recounted with delight. "Went down like a felled tree."
"What about when Rus tried to tackle Lim?" Mic added. "Pure aggression, zero technique. Beautiful to watch."
Jay held a single beer while the others drank with more enthusiasm. When pressed to keep up with the group's consumption, he demurred with honest self-assessment.
"I'm terrible with alcohol in general. I have to pace myself if I want to function tomorrow."
Rus, who had been matching drinks with Van and Mic, immediately began intercepting attempts to press more alcohol on Jay. "Leave him alone. Someone needs to stay coherent enough to get us home."
The gesture touched Jay. Despite barely knowing him outside the gym, Rus was looking out for him without being asked.
The conversation flowed well between the two teams. Rus, Mic, and Van represented a more working-class, downtown sensibility, while Luc's flatmates embodied the polished professionalism of young finance workers, yet the shared experience of getting beaten up had created an unexpected bond.
Stories grew louder and more exaggerated as the evening progressed. Jay laughed at retellings of his own spectacular failures, no longer embarrassed by his complete lack of sword-fighting aptitude. The good-natured teasing never turned mean-spirited, and both groups were content with how the evening had unfolded.
They finally parted ways after two in the morning, with everyone except Jay thoroughly intoxicated. They rode a taxi back to their neighbourhood, with stops to drop off Mic and Van at their respective homes before Rus insisted on escorting Jay to his apartment building.
"That was fun," Rus said as they stood outside Jay's door. "Thanks for thinking of me."
"I'm glad I did. You and your friends made the evening work."
"Van's going to be talking about this for months. He loves any excuse to prove he's the most physically capable person in the room."
Jay fumbled with his keys, the combination of exhaustion and alcohol making fine motor control challenging. "You seemed like you enjoyed it too."
"Absolutely. We should do more things like this, group activities that get everyone moving."
"I'll keep that in mind for future social planning disasters."
Rus laughed and waited until Jay successfully unlocked his door before heading back to the waiting taxi.
Jay stumbled into his apartment, too tired and drunk to manage more than removing his shoes before collapsing onto his bed fully clothed. The evening had been far more successful than he had dared hope.
Scene 5
House hunting
Saturday's gym session was filled with suffering. Jay arrived looking worn out and moving sluggishly.
"You look like hell," Rus said, though his own appearance wasn't particularly fresh either.
Jay yawned widely before answering. "I'm not built for staying out past midnight."
"Fair enough. Let's take it easy today."
Rus mercifully adjusted the workout to accommodate their fatigue, choosing exercises that were almost leisurely. Jay moved through the sets slowly, his body protesting each movement while his mind processed the previous evening's unexpected social success.
They parted ways with promises of future adventures, though Jay suspected his next social planning venture would involve less alcohol consumption.
Jay arrived at work at his usual time on Monday morning. The weekend's adventure had left him sore, but with a sense of accomplishment.
"You look like someone who had an interesting weekend," Ian observed when Jay appeared in his office for their morning briefing.
"That's one way to put it. The fencing experiment was... educational."
"How educational?"
"I lost every single match. Spectacularly. But everyone else seemed to have a wonderful time, so I'm calling it a success."
Ian tried to hide amusement. "Your team-building exercise involved duels?"
"It turned into a proper competition between Luc's flatmates and my gym friends. Luc's team got absolutely destroyed, which somehow made everyone bond over shared humiliation. The evening ended with drinks and war stories about our various defeats."
"And you survived this social experiment?"
"More than survived. I think I might actually have made some real friends. Rus and his military buddy Van were good company, and even Luc's flatmates turned out to be decent people once you get past the yuppie exterior."
"It sounds like you've developed friendships outside of work."
"I think so. Rus is a solid guy. He looked out for me when everyone was trying to get me to drink more than I could handle."
Ian listened to Jay's animated recounting of the evening's events, battling a surge of jealousy that felt both irrational and consuming. Jay's obvious pleasure in describing his expanding social connections should have been gratifying. It was evidence of healthy relationship-building. Instead, Ian catalogued each new person who now had claims on Jay's time and attention.
"It sounds like quite the adventure," Ian managed.
"It was. Though I'm hoping my next social planning challenge involves less potential for physical injury."
Ian managed what he hoped was a supportive smile, but he couldn't shake the selfish wish that Jay's best stories still came from their shared experiences.
The following week created a new pattern that Ian found deeply unsettling. Jay's scheduled apartment viewings meant he left work at five o'clock each day, abandoning their extended evening hours and kitchen conversations. Each departure left Ian alone in the office, staring at work he'd have to complete alone, drinking coffee that tasted flat.
Jay spent nearly every afternoon touring apartments, covering over twenty options across different neighbourhoods. Only Tuesday remained sacred, reserved for his gym session with Rus. Each evening he returned home with new photos, fresh notes, and growing clarity about what kind of space he wanted to call home.
The apartment hunting process turned out to be quite frustrating for Jay. He had prepared comprehensive materials consisting of printed listings with key information that he supplemented with detailed notes. His requirements were reasonable, but finding the right combination of factors within his budget was proving challenging.
The first property, a modern flat close to the office, was sleek and convenient but cramped and expensive. The second, in an older building near the historic district, offered more space and character but would add twenty minutes to his commute. The third fell somewhere between the two extremes but lacked natural light and had a kitchen that barely qualified as functional.
By Thursday evening, Jay had accumulated a folder full of detailed notes but no clear frontrunner among his options.
On Friday morning, Jay camped in the office kitchen during the coffee break, a thick folder spread across the table as he discussed his findings with Zoe and Luc. Other team members drifted over, drawn by the photos and animated conversation about Jay's housing prospects.
The folder was meticulously organized, beginning with a typed list of requirements and priorities, followed by information for each potential apartment complete with photos, floor plans, and detailed pros and cons lists. Jay's approach had whittled down the possibilities to twelve serious contenders, each meeting his basic requirements of good location, minimum forty-four square meters, and reasonable safety standards.
"You've really thought this through," Zoe observed, examining the materials.
"Maybe too thoroughly. I keep finding reasons why each option isn't quite right."
Luc picked up one of the listings. "This one near the cathedral looks nice. Historic area, good size."
"Beautiful neighbourhood, but the building is older, with potential maintenance issues. And longer commute."
"What about this modern place? Great location, all the amenities," Zoe held up another one.
"Tiny. I'd barely have more space than I do now."
Kim read the listings. "These industrial district ones look impressive. Much more space for the money, and the vibe of the area is awesome."
"They are. Great value, modern amenities, but the metro access is less convenient. It would add a fifteen minute walk to my daily commute each way."
"You're overthinking this. Pick the one that feels right when you walk in. All the analysis in the world won't tell you what it's like to actually live somewhere," Luc said.
"I suppose I could narrow it down to the top two and spend more time in each space," Jay conceded.
Amy looked over the financial calculations Jay had included with each option. "You're being too conservative with your budget. The financial district apartments would put you right in the heart of everything."
"And cost twice what I'm comfortable spending," Jay replied with a laugh.
Max, who had been quietly reviewing the materials, finally looked up. "Stop being so frugal and move somewhere that will make you happy. You can afford more than you think you can."
The conversation continued with each colleague advocating for different priorities. Jay listened to all perspectives, but it only made the decision process more overwhelming.
As the end of the day approached and colleagues began gathering their belongings for the weekend, Luc appeared at Jay's desk with a sly expression.
"Last week's adventure was definitely entertaining, but my ego is still bruised from losing to your muscle-bound friends."
Jay looked up from his computer with undisguised distrust. "And?"
"It requires compensation."
"I thought you had fun."
"I did. But being thoroughly beaten by three strangers in front of my flatmates has damaged my reputation."
"What do you have in mind for compensation?"
"A blind date. That's what you should have organized in the first place instead of a sweaty gathering of burly men."
"Absolutely not."
"I already have everything arranged. Gav is bringing someone he knows from college, and we need one more person because there will be four women. You literally just have to show up and fill out the numbers."
"Luc, I don't do blind dates. I don't do dates at all, really."
"Hear me out. What you organized last week was fun, but what I actually needed was something more... social. Romantic, even."
"Still not interested."
"You owe me for the humiliation of being defeated in sword combat by people I'd never met before. Plus you don't have to do anything, just show up and be polite. It's a numbers game, nothing more."
Jay looked at his apartment folders, then back at Luc's expectant face. The guilt trip was working, despite his complete lack of interest in romantic social activities.
"This is a terrible idea," Jay said finally.
"That's not a no."
"It's not a yes either."
"Come on, Jay. One evening. What's the worst that could happen?"
Jay could think of numerous answers to that question, none of them comforting. But Luc's persistence, combined with the guilt over the fencing evening's unintended consequences, was wearing down his resistance.
"I hate this," Jay said with resignation.
"Noted. But you're still coming."
Jay sighed heavily, already regretting his decision. "Fine. But I'm warning you now that I'm going to be terrible at this."
"You just have to show up. That's enough."
"When is this supposed to happen?" Jay asked, resigned to his fate.
"Tomorrow night. Saturday dinner, very civilized."
"Tomorrow? "You couldn't give me more warning?"
"I wanted to make sure you couldn't overthink it and talk yourself out of it."
"This is going to be a disaster," Jay muttered, but Luc was already moving on to logistical details, clearly considering the matter decided.
From his office, Ian had been listening to this conversation with growing fury. By the time Luc left, Ian was struggling to maintain composure. The thought of Jay on a date, potentially connecting with someone who might become important in his life, was almost suffocating.
He gave himself several minutes to calm down before approaching Jay's desk, trying to appear casual.
"A date, huh?"
Jay spun in his desk chair, his expression showing obvious dismay. "It's a dreadful idea. I hate everything about it and want to bail."
"Your comfort matters too. Luc should consider that before making these demands."
"I know, but I did promise to do something to cheer him up, and apparently I delivered the wrong kind of entertainment last week." Jay sighed heavily. "What's the worst that could happen, right?"
Ian wanted to enumerate exactly what could happen, starting with Jay meeting someone wonderful and ending with the complete destruction of Ian's fragile emotional landscape. Instead, he managed a supportive response.
"If it becomes unbearable, you could always leave early."
"True. Maybe I'll call you to come pick me up if it goes badly."
"Absolutely do that. I'll keep my phone by my side all evening."
Jay seemed comforted by this offer, unaware that Ian was already planning to spend Saturday evening anxiously waiting for exactly such a call.
Chapter 27: Shared traumas
Scene 1
Blind date
Saturday's gym session began with Jay's immediate need to vent his frustrations to the one person he thought would understand.
"Luc roped me into this blind date thing tonight. I absolutely don't want to do it, but he guilt-tripped me into agreeing."
Rus however seemed quite enthusiastic about the idea. "That's fantastic! Exactly what you should be doing, going out with friends, meeting some girls, having fun. You spend too much time working."
Jay stared at him in dismay. "You're supposed to be on my side here."
Rus clapped him on the shoulder. "I am on your side. That's why I think this is great for you. You need more social life, more dating experience."
"Even you're against me? Ian is the only person who actually supports my desire to avoid this disaster."
"Ian? Wait, that's your boss, right? The one who gave you all that trouble?"
"He never gave me trouble. That was all a misunderstanding."
"Jay, you need to stay away from that guy. This date tonight is exactly what you need to get some perspective."
Jay left the gym feeling thoroughly betrayed. Even Rus, who he had thought was a friend, was pushing him toward this. Ian was the only person who truly understood how uncomfortable this situation made him, and here was Rus warning him away from the one supportive voice in his life.
When he returned home, Rus's words were still echoing in his mind, but his primary emotion was defiance. He didn't want to stay away from Ian. If anything, he would much rather spend the evening with Ian than suffer through what promised to be an excruciating ordeal.
That evening, Jay stood in front of his mirror wearing his most elegant gray three-piece suit, the one that made him feel like someone important. The formal attire was probably excessive for the occasion, but he needed every bit of confidence he could muster. If he was going to survive this evening, he wanted to feel like the best version of himself.
The restaurant was upscale but not intimidating, and Jay arrived to find Luc and his flatmate Gav already waiting with another man he didn't recognize.
"Jay, this is Yan," Luc said, gesturing to a strikingly handsome man who seemed like he was accustomed to being the most interesting person in any room.
Yan's handshake was firm. "The mysterious coworker. Luc's told me you're quite successful."
Before Jay could respond, the women arrived in a flurry of laughter. They were all attractive and seemed friendly enough, but Jay was unable to retain their names beyond the first few seconds of meeting them. The social situation was already overwhelming his processing capacity.
At dinner, Yan dominated the conversation, never doubting his own charm. Jay was content to remain in the background, letting the evening unfold around him without his active participation.
As the wine flowed, however, Yan's comments began to take on a slightly sharper edge.
"You know, with that suit and that serious expression, you look like a funeral director. Very dignified, very... sombre."
Jay felt heat rise in his cheeks while Luc raised an eyebrow at the comment. The women seemed oblivious to the undercurrent, their attention focused on Yan's stories about his various adventures and connections. Jay noticed that one of them, a tall blonde with a bright laugh who might have been named Ana, was paying particular attention to Luc, which seemed to please him considerably.
After dinner, the group relocated to a nearby pub. Luc caught Jay's arm discreetly as they walked.
"I know this isn't your scene, but could you stick it out for just another hour? I don't want to make things weird by leaving too early."
Jay could see that Luc was enjoying Ana's company, and his request seemed reasonable enough. "Fine. One hour."
The new setting was no easier than the restaurant. Gav was growing visibly frustrated as Yan monopolized all three remaining women's attention, leaving both Jay and Gav as unwilling spectators to his performance. Jay ordered a single beer, having no intention of compromising his judgement further.
"Not drinking tonight? Worried about losing control?" Yan asked with mock concern.
"I don't handle alcohol well," Jay replied simply.
"Come on, funeral director. Live a little. You're bringing down the whole energy of the table."
Jay's jaw tightened, but he said nothing. Luc attempted to redirect the conversation, but Yan's attention seemed increasingly focused on Jay.
It was nearly eleven when the disaster struck. Yan, ostensibly rising a little too abruptly from his chair, brushed against one of the women at the table. Her glass tilted, and a splash of red wine landed across Jay’s jacket, blooming into a stain that would not come out easily.
"Oh my God, I'm so sorry! How clumsy of me. I'm absolutely mortified." Yan exclaimed theatrically.
Jay stared down at his ruined suit, the most expensive piece of clothing he owned, the one that had cost him so much embarrassment at the tailor's. The liquid was still spreading across the fabric, and he could smell the sharp scent beginning to set into the wool.
"It's fine. Accidents happen," Jay managed, though his voice was tight with suppressed emotion. Yan's expression made Jay suspect it hadn't been entirely accidental. "I should go. Get this cleaned as soon as possible."
Luc looked up from his conversation with Ana, clearly torn. "Are you sure you're okay?"
"I'm fine. It's just a small stain. Enjoy the rest of your evening."
Jay left the pub without looking back, walking several blocks before finding a small park where he could sit on a bench and properly assess the damage to his suit. The stain was extensive and already setting. Even a cleaning service might not be able to restore the garment completely.
He sat in the November chill and felt the full weight of the evening's misery wash over him. The date had been uncomfortable from the start, he had been subtly mocked and ignored, and now his best suit was possibly destroyed.
On impulse, he pulled out his phone and sent a text to Ian: "The evening did go badly."
His phone rang immediately.
"Do you need to be picked up?" Ian sounded concerned, and spoke with no preamble or social pleasantries.
Jay was surprised by the immediate response. "I don't want to impose. It's late and—"
"Where are you?" Ian interrupted, and Jay could hear the sound of keys jingling. "I'm already heading to my car."
"You don't have to—" Jay's voice cracked slightly, betraying the emotional strain he was trying to hide.
"Just give me the location. I'll be there immediately."
Jay provided the address of the park, then hung up feeling simultaneously foolish for calling and overjoyed that Ian cared enough to respond so quickly. Before he had time to fully regret his decision or work himself into greater anxiety about imposing on Ian's evening, headlights appeared at the street corner.
Ian's car pulled up to the curb, and Jay stood from the bench, weighed down by a thoroughly disappointing evening. Whatever happened next, at least he wouldn't have to face the journey home alone.
Scene 2
Rescue
As Jay got into Ian's car, the first words out of his mouth were profuse apologies, his speech slightly slurred by the alcohol.
"I'm so sorry for calling you out like this. I know it's late and you probably had plans and I just—"
"It's nothing," Ian interrupted, pulling away from the curb. "Are you alright? That's what matters."
Jay slumped against the passenger seat. "I'm fine, but my best suit is ruined."
Ian glanced at the dark stain spreading across Jay's jacket. "It's red wine, right? I know a good emergency cleaner nearby. They might be able to save it. Wine stains aren't unusual, they definitely have experience with this kind of thing."
The drive took less than five minutes, barely enough time for Jay to process what was happening before Ian was pulling up outside a small shop with bright lights still on.
"Emergency dry cleaning. They specialize in situations exactly like this."
The woman behind the counter examined the stain. "We can probably manage this. The important thing is that you got here quickly. The longer these things sit, the harder they become to treat."
"It feels a bit like emergency surgery for a beloved hamster," Jay said with a weak smile.
Ian was relieved at Jay's attempt at humour. At least he seemed to be recovering from whatever had upset him earlier.
"Should I drive you home now?" Ian asked as they returned to the car.
Jay looked down at himself, white shirt, vest, no jacket, and shook his head. "I actually need a drink first. Though I probably look like a newspaper delivery boy."
"Not at all. You look charming. I know just the place that will accommodate us."
Ten minutes later they were sitting at the bar of a small pub in a more upscale district, with dim lights and live music. Jay still felt awkward about his incomplete outfit, but the atmosphere was welcoming enough.
Ian ordered whisky for both of them, then paused. "You don't actually like whisky, do you."
"I've heard it's an acquired taste," Jay replied, accepting the glass. "Seems like a good moment to do some acquiring."
Ian smiled despite his concern. "What happened tonight?"
Jay took a sip of the whisky and grimaced slightly. "The whole evening was awkward. Some arrogant guy spent the night telling me I looked like a funeral director, among other charming observations. Then he managed to spill wine all over my jacket. But at least Luc seemed to hit it off with one of the women, so the night wasn't a complete loss for everyone."
"The man was probably jealous. You looked good tonight. You still look good."
Jay laughed bitterly. "Jealous of what? He looked like a movie star himself."
"Secure men don't feel the need to prop themselves up by putting others down."
Jay drained the rest of his whisky in one swallow and signaled for another. Ian watched with growing concern as Jay's caution around alcohol seemed to have completely disappeared.
"What's wrong? You normally don't drink at all, and definitely not like this."
Jay accepted his second drink and met Ian's eyes directly. "I never drink because being drunk makes me vulnerable to other people taking advantage of me. But that's not really a concern when you're around, is it? So I might as well indulge. Besides, I need to kill the bad taste this evening left. Maybe it can even be salvaged after all."
His phone buzzed with a text from Luc asking if he was alright. Jay typed back quickly: "Fine. Took jacket to emergency cleaner, having a drink in a pub with a friend."
On impulse, he held up his phone for a selfie, capturing both himself and a surprised-looking Ian in the frame. He wanted to send it to Luc, but seemed to change his mind before pressing the button.
"Drinking makes you much more relaxed," Ian observed, looking puzzled by the sudden photo.
"I know. My defences go way down. That's exactly why it's so dangerous for me to drink." Jay's honesty was so casual, so trusting, that Ian felt an overwhelming wave of affection that was getting hard to suppress.
Jay ordered another drink despite Ian's attempts to slow him down.
"I rarely have a chance like this, and I really need it right now," Jay insisted, and Ian was unable to refuse when Jay was clearly still processing the evening's disappointment.
But within half an hour, Jay had consumed four more whiskies and was visibly intoxicated, his words slurring and his coordination becoming unreliable.
"I think it's time to get you home," Ian said, signaling for the check and calling a taxi.
The taxi ride required some management as Jay dozed fitfully against Ian's shoulder. When they reached Jay's building, Ian realized the full scope of his challenge: four flights of stairs with an intoxicated man who could barely stand independently.
Ian briefly contemplated taking Jay to his own place instead, but that seemed like an overreach. Instead, he half-dragged Jay up the stairs, pausing frequently to readjust his grip and catch their breath. By the time they reached Jay's door, Ian was thankful for every hour he spent sweating at the gym.
He had to search Jay's pockets for keys while supporting his weight, a process that felt deeply invasive. Jay was cooperative, but clearly had no real awareness of what was happening around him.
Once inside the small apartment, Jay immediately collapsed onto the couch as if his strings had been cut. Ian stood uncertainly in the doorway, torn between leaving Jay to sleep it off alone and staying to monitor his condition. The proper thing would be to leave, staying overnight would be presumptuous at best, potentially catastrophic at worst.
But worry won out over other considerations. Jay was more intoxicated than Ian had ever seen him, and leaving him alone felt unconscionable.
Ian helped Jay out of his shirt and suit, providing water and gentle encouragement to drink small sips between Jay's protests that he was fine. Getting Jay from the couch to his bed required more physical support, but Jay remained cooperative even as he mumbled incoherent responses to Ian's instructions.
"Just sleep it off," Ian murmured, making sure Jay was positioned safely on his side with water within reach. "Everything will look better in the morning."
With Jay put to bed, Ian stretched out on the couch that had dominated the small space. His heart was still racing from the evening's events, from the phone call that had sent him rushing across the city to this moment of lying in Jay's apartment listening to his unsteady breathing.
Ian stared at the ceiling and acknowledged that he had crossed several lines tonight. But Jay had trusted him enough to call when he needed help, had been vulnerable enough to admit that Ian made him feel safe, and Ian couldn't regret any of it. 
Ian pulled a blanket over himself, doubting he would actually sleep but content to maintain his protective vigil until Jay was safely recovered.
Scene 3
Accepting help
Jay woke to a splitting headache and the sensation that someone had replaced his brain with broken glass. He pressed his palms against his temples and tried to piece together the fragments of the previous evening. The blind date. The wine stain. Calling Ian. Then... nothing. A void where his memory should be.
He rolled over with a pitiful moan, trying to understand how he had gotten home, when he heard a voice from somewhere nearby.
"Take these. They'll help with the pain."
Jay's eyes snapped open to find Ian standing beside his bed, holding out painkillers and a glass of water. The sight sent Jay into instant panic. He practically launched himself upright, suddenly aware that he was wearing nothing but his underwear, then scrambled backward until his shoulders hit the wall, pulling his sheets around himself in a desperate attempt at modesty.
"What—how did I— Ian, I'm so sorry, I don't remember—"
Ian immediately stepped back, alarm crossing his features. "Jay, you're safe. Nothing happened. I promise you're completely safe."
The fear in Jay's eyes startled Ian, who had never imagined that he might be interpreted as threatening. He backed away further, putting as much distance as possible between himself and the bed.
The reassurance in Ian's voice only made Jay's panic worse, but for entirely different reasons than Ian suspected. The terrible reality was dawning on him: he had apparently made Ian Hagen stay overnight in his cramped, messy studio apartment. The most refined man he knew had been forced to sleep on Jay's tiny, uncomfortable couch. It was unthinkable.
"Did you sleep here? On my couch?"
"Jay, let me explain—"
"Oh God." Jay buried his face in his hands. "Ian, I'm so sorry. How could I let this happen? You shouldn't have had to—"
Ian raised his hands in a calming gesture. "You called me when you needed help. You were quite intoxicated, and it didn't feel safe to leave you alone. I made the decision to stay. But I can leave right now if that would make you more comfortable."
"No!" Jay's head shot up. "I mean—wait. Just give me a minute to process this disaster."
Ian watched with growing confusion as Jay's distress seemed to have nothing to do with impropriety and everything to do with hosting arrangements. "Take the painkillers first. Please."
Jay accepted the pills and water, downing both gratefully. Ian watched him for a moment, then asked, "Would you like coffee?"
"You don't need to wait on me," Jay protested, attempting to scramble to his feet. "I can—"
"Lay down and rest," Ian said firmly, placing a gentle hand on Jay's shoulder to stop him.
Jay collapsed back against his pillow with a miserable groan, pulling the covers over his head.
Ian sat on the bed, speaking in the same tone he might use to soothe a skittish animal. "It's okay to let friends help when you need it. That's what friends are for. There's no shame in needing assistance, and it's not a burden on the people who care about you."
While Ian went to make coffee, Jay remained hidden under his covers, wrestling with the magnitude of his mortification. When Ian returned and set a mug on the bedside table, Jay finally emerged enough to accept it.
Ian sat on the couch with his own cup, giving Jay space to process. After several minutes of silence, Jay managed to drink some coffee and eventually wobbled to his feet.
"I'm going to take a shower," he mumbled, disappearing into the bathroom.
The cold water helped clear his head somewhat, and when he emerged wearing sweatpants and a t-shirt, he felt better. He sat at his small table and looked at Ian with an intense expression.
"Are you feeling like eating breakfast?" Ian asked.
"I feel like dying," Jay replied flatly.
"Is the hangover that severe?"
Jay shook his head miserably. "I can't believe I made you sleep on that awful couch. Ian, I'm so sorry. The indignity of it. The sheer presumption."
Ian set down his coffee cup. "You didn't make me do anything. You were frankly not in any position to make decisions. It was entirely my choice. I apologize if I overstepped and made you uncomfortable."
"I'm not uncomfortable," Jay said quickly. "I'm mortified at my audacity. Making my boss escort my drunk self home and stay over in my uncomfortable studio—"
Ian laughed softly. "I did it as your friend, not your boss. And if I recall correctly, you did the same thing quite recently for Luc. So you must be familiar with the general concept."
"That's not the same thing."
"How so?"
Jay looked at him with exasperated disbelief. "You know why. You're... well, you're too well-bred for dilapidated accommodations like this."
Ian's laugh was more amused now. He stood up and moved toward Jay's small kitchen. "I'm making eggs for breakfast."
"Ian, you don't have to—"
"I actually lived in a studio even smaller than this one for years," Ian said, dismissing Jay's protests as he began searching through cupboards. "When my father threw me out after the scandal, I was told to leave immediately and never return. I didn't even have a chance to gather my belongings. I left my childhood home with literally nothing but the clothes on my back."
Jay stared at him, stunned into silence.
Ian continued as he worked, cracking eggs into a pan. "All my accounts were cancelled within hours. I didn't have a single penny to my name. I had to sell my watch just to have enough money to rent a place to stay. At first, I stayed in the cheapest hotel I could find, then I rented a run-down studio in a far worse part of the city than this. I lived there for eight years, until I had accumulated enough assets to comfortably buy my own apartment."
"Eight years?"
"I didn't even have a bed, unlike you. I slept on a couch that wasn't much more comfortable than yours. During that time, I quickly accepted that my old life was over, and honestly, I was too heartbroken to care much about material comfort. I was resigned to working as a waiter or whatever employment I could find."
Jay felt his world tilting slightly. He had known about the disownment, but he had never pondered the practical realities. He had assumed Ian must have had some kind of safety net, some resources to fall back on.
"Leo found me before I could sink that far. He offered me a position, but at first I was too proud to accept help. It was Leo who gave me the speech about accepting assistance from friends—almost word for word what I just told you. I'm glad I listened to him, because it allowed me to build a life with my own hands. Looking back, I realize he was right. Being unwilling to accept help during your darkest moments is unwise."
Ian finished cooking and served the eggs, setting a plate in front of Jay along with fresh coffee. Jay took a tentative bite and his eyes widened in surprise. The food was perfectly prepared, seasoned just right, and Jay stared at Ian with complete astonishment.
"You're an incredible cook."
Ian smiled as he sat down with his own plate. "During those years, I cooked, cleaned, did laundry—all the normal things everyone else does. It was a sobering experience that showed me exactly how privileged I had been growing up, having servants attend to every need."
Jay ate slowly, partly because of his lingering nausea but mostly because he was processing this revelation. As he watched Ian across the small table—this man he had admired for so long—Jay realized that despite everything he thought he knew about Ian's history, he had barely scratched the surface. Every new piece of information only deepened his respect.
Ian had survived complete rejection by his family, had built himself back up from nothing, and had somehow emerged from that experience with his integrity intact. And now he was sitting in Jay's modest apartment, making breakfast and treating Jay's hungover as if it was the most natural thing in the world.
"Thank you," Jay said softly. "For last night. For staying. For... everything."
"That's what friends do."
Scene 4
Deepening bonds
After they finished eating, Jay insisted on cleaning up despite Ian's protests that he should rest. The domestic task helped clear the last of the fog from his mind, and he moved more steadily as the painkillers and food worked their magic.
The atmosphere lightened as Jay assessed his clothes from the previous evening, which Ian had thoughtfully hung on the closet doors instead of leaving them crumpled on the floor.
"Your housing situation really is dire," Ian observed, gesturing toward the tower of suitcases dominating the centre of the room and the clothing overflowing from every available storage space.
Jay followed his gaze ruefully. "I know. I've been apartment hunting all week, but I keep running into problems with every option. Too expensive, too small, bad location, questionable building maintenance. There's always something."
Ian listened as Jay outlined his various concerns and criteria, then reached into his wallet and produced a business card.
"This is someone I know. He's a reliable real estate agent who specializes in finding good value in overlooked properties. He might be able to show you some interesting options."
Jay accepted the card hesitantly. "Ian, I'm already imposing on you so much. I can't keep asking for favours."
"That's hardly imposing. I thought I explained quite emphatically that our circumstances aren't really all that different. You don't need to look at me with such reverence. I just had more time to establish myself, and perhaps a slightly easier start. Though I'm not entirely certain about the easier start, because while my material conditions were initially better, you at least have a family who cares about you."
Jay went quiet for a moment, processing this perspective. "Your family really is awful. To abandon you when you needed them most. It's unconscionable."
Ian's response was almost reflexive. "I don't blame them. It was my own fault what happened. I deserved the consequences."
Jay stared at him in horror. "You deserved nothing of the sort! You were a victim. You were used by an unscrupulous man, and instead of comforting you in your pain, your family threw you out. They're awful people."
"In my circles, there are certain expectations about being mindful at all times—"
"I don't care about high society expectations." Jay's anger was building, his voice taking on an edge Ian had never heard before. "You were betrayed by someone you trusted, and instead of receiving support, you were punished for being human. That's not how decent people behave. That's just cruelty."
Ian looked sad and somewhat defeated, but he didn't budge from his position. "I got exactly what I deserved."
Jay stared at him with obvious frustration, then moved to the couch with a distinctly grumpy expression. "You want to talk about deserving consequences? Let me tell you about my first job. My first boss was wonderful. Charming, attentive, supportive. I thought I'd struck gold with this amazing mentor who was going to guide my career. Until after a company party where I got drunk, and he pushed himself on me. A married man with children."
Ian went very still. Though he had known this story from Jay's background check, hearing it directly was entirely different.
"I cried, I protested, I managed to get away before he could... complete what he intended. But afterwards, he told me I had asked for it. That it was obvious I wanted his attention, so I shouldn't play coy. I went to HR, but they dismissed my complaint entirely. So I quit immediately."
Jay was quiet for a moment, lost in the memory. 
"I wasn't in a good financial position. High rent, minimal savings, and the job search was brutal. I had to swallow my pride and call my mother for help. I didn't want to explain what happened, but I was so distraught that it all came spilling out. Do you know what she told me? She called him a pig. A bastard and a lowlife. She said of course she'd send money, that it wasn't my fault. She didn't say I should have been more careful or that I'd brought it on myself. She recognized I was a victim, just like you were. And that's how family should respond."
Jay met Ian's eyes directly. "Mind you, I wasn't particularly close to my mother at that point. But she still knew right from wrong. She still protected her child when he needed it most."
Ian sat in silence, processing Jay's words. Hearing Jay's personal account, seeing the trust Jay was placing in him by sharing this trauma, it felt monumental. Ian wanted to respond appropriately, to honour that trust with the right words, but he felt overwhelmed by the responsibility.
The silence stretched, and Jay watched Ian's expression, sad and confused, as if he were wrestling with concepts that challenged his fundamental beliefs. Jay's heart ached watching Ian struggle with ideas that should have been simple.
"Get up," Jay said suddenly.
Ian looked puzzled. "What?"
"I'm going to hug you now, if that's okay."
Ian nodded, still confused, and rose from his chair. Jay enveloped him in a warm, encompassing embrace, complete with a gentle pat on the back.
"It was not your fault," Jay said firmly into Ian's ear. "I'm sorry you were surrounded by people so awful they made you think you had to shoulder all of that guilt yourself. The man who wronged you was a pig, and you don't need to make excuses for any of them." He pulled back slightly to meet Ian's eyes. "Maybe Leo really isn't as bad as I thought. I might need to reassess my opinion of him."
They broke apart, and Ian's voice was quiet when he responded. "Thank you. And what happened to you was terrible. I'm sorry you went through that."
Jay shrugged with forced casualness. "We all have our stories that shaped us into the men we are."
The moment suddenly felt heavy. They had each shared their deepest trauma, their most vulnerable experiences, and the weight of that trust hung between them as they looked into each other's eyes.
Jay's phone buzzed, breaking the moment. He glanced at the screen with a grimace. "It's Luc, checking if I made it home alright and apologizing that the evening turned sour." He looked up with a snarky expression. "The main architect of yesterday's disaster has no shame acting so nonchalant."
He typed back: "Hangover is killing me. Whether I forgive you depends on how good a job the cleaner does."
The mention of the jacket reminded them both of their pending errand. "We should go retrieve your suit," Ian said. "I need to collect my car from the pub anyway."
"Ian, I really don't want to impose—"
Ian gave him a pointed look. "We just discussed the imposing issue, didn't we?"
Jay changed into more presentable clothes, and they took a taxi to the pub to collect Ian's car before driving to the emergency cleaner. Jay held his breath as the woman behind the counter brought out his suit jacket. It looked pristine, with no trace of the previous evening's accident.
Jay's relief was palpable. "It looks like new! Thank you so much."
As they left the shop, Jay turned to Ian with determination. "The least I can do is buy you lunch. After everything you've done..."
Ian seemed pleased. "I'd like that very much."
Scene 5
Weekend plans
They chose a nearby restaurant that looked cosy enough and ordered simple but well-prepared dishes. As they waited for their food, Jay got curious about Ian's eating habits.
"I have to ask. What's the deal with your meal service? I know you have everything delivered according to detailed specifications."
"I've always been fairly serious about staying fit, and at this point it's easier to outsource meal planning to ensure consistency with my training requirements."
"Are you very strict about it?"
"Not obsessive. I don't mind adjusting when circumstances call for it. I never skip business lunches or social occasions. But on regular days, I stick to the meal plan. It serves me well, and it's one less decision to make. I don't really miss having to cook."
"I feel terrible about taking up so much of your weekend. You had to make concessions on your meals, probably your gym schedule, all to babysit me."
Ian's response was delivered with perfect deadpan seriousness. "Yes, it's quite tragic. I was right in the middle of updating spreadsheet templates for the annual reporting cycle in January. Whatever will I do now?"
Jay laughed, assuming it was a joke, then gradually realized Ian's expression hadn't changed. "Wait, you're serious. You were actually going to spend your Sunday working on spreadsheets?"
"I generally spend weekends on exercise and non-urgent work projects. It helps ensure business operations run smoothly."
Jay stared at him in horror. "What about leisure time? Surely you must take some time to just... relax?"
"I do gym sessions. That's quite enough recreational activity."
"Ian. That's not leisure. That's still self-improvement."
Ian seemed puzzled by Jay's reaction, which only made Jay more worried. He had already been concerned about Ian's working habits during the week, but this revelation painted an even more troubling picture.
An idea began forming in Jay's mind. Half teasing, half serious, he said, "What if I came over next Saturday and helped with those spreadsheets? Then you'd have no excuse but to take Sunday off."
He didn't really expect Ian to agree to such a suggestion, but Ian was looking at him as if he was considering it.
"You cannot possibly mean that."
"I owe you for everything you've done, and I won't let you waste all your weekends on paperwork. Besides, spreadsheets aren't torture when you have good company."
Ian hesitated, clearly torn. "I don't want you to feel obligated—"
"I don't feel obligated."
Ian seemed to wrestle with the offer for several moments. "You don't need to push yourself. Only come if you don't have anything better to do."
Jay felt unexpected excitement. He hadn't really thought Ian would entertain the idea. "As long as you don't mind having me there, I don't mind coming. Actually, I'd enjoy it."
"Then... yes. That would be helpful."
Their food arrived, providing a brief intermission in the conversation. After a few bites, Jay felt oddly emboldened by the atmosphere and their growing closeness. 
"What do you plan to do with your free Sunday then?"
"I haven't given it much thought."
Jay narrowed his eyes suspiciously. "You're not really planning to relax at all, are you? You're going to find more work to do."
"I don't do hard work at home. Just less pressing matters," Ian protested weakly.
"That's still work!" Jay threw up his hands in dramatic exasperation. "Should I make plans for Sunday too, just to ensure you actually rest?"
Jay wasn't sure if he was overstepping badly, but Ian gave the suggestion serious thought.
"If you want to be certain I take the day off, you probably should make plans. I'm not entirely sure I know how to spend a whole day without some form of productive activity."
Jay rolled his eyes. "We're going to have to fix that. I have a week to think of something appropriately relaxing. If nothing else comes to mind, I'll just book another fencing session."
"That went so well the last time."
"Hey, everyone else enjoyed it. My complete humiliation was apparently highly entertaining."
When they finished their meal, Ian drove Jay home. Jay retrieved his rescued jacket from Ian's car and returned to his apartment, feeling strangely energized. It had been an unusually intense weekend, and he wasn't sure if he felt distressed or exhilarated.
The sudden closeness with Ian felt both precious and fragile. He knew he was imposing, but he was overjoyed Ian allowed it. He was surprised by his own forwardness in inserting himself into Ian's weekend schedule like this.
Rus's warning echoed in his mind—that he shouldn't get so close to his boss. Sound, prudent advice that he agreed with completely and chose to disregard entirely. He wanted to get closer to Ian, as close as he was allowed to be. He didn't care if it was foolish.
Standing in front of his bathroom mirror, Jay studied his reflection. When had he become so reckless? But as he asked himself the question, he discovered it didn't matter. It felt good. It felt right.
Meanwhile, Ian felt far less conflicted about the development. He felt blessed. He had wanted to get closer to Jay, and the universe had helped him achieve that goal. Now he had plans with Jay—an entire weekend together.
The memory of Jay's embrace, of his protectiveness, made his heart race. But Ian held no illusions about his position. Jay's story had served as a stark reminder—Jay trusted him precisely because he knew Ian would never touch him. It didn't matter. Ian had never harboured any romantic notions anyway.
He tried not to get his hopes up too much, knowing that disappointment would be crushing if Jay changed his mind or if the weekend turned awkward, but he couldn't help himself. He had something to look forward to. He had Jay coming to his apartment, Jay concerned about his well-being, Jay taking charge of his recreational activities.
The thought made Ian smile as he opened his laptop, finally turning to those spreadsheet templates that had been interrupted by much more important matters. The work felt less tedious knowing that next weekend, he wouldn't be doing it alone. Next weekend, Jay would be there, drinking coffee and ensuring he took proper breaks. 
It was going to be wonderful.
Chapter 28: Unusually warm autumn
Scene 1
Practical considerations
Both Jay and Ian arrived at the office shortly before eight, having slept in slightly to recover from their eventful weekend. They threw themselves into the demands of the day, only briefly acknowledging their shared time together, though there was a closeness to their interactions now, as if they’d known each other for years.
"You still look groggy," Ian observed during their morning briefing.
"I had trouble getting up. The weekend took more out of me than expected. How's your back? That couch can't have been comfortable."
"I've slept in worse places. Though I admit I was glad to be back in my own bed."
During his morning coffee break in the kitchen, Jay found Luc already there, wearing a contrite expression.
"You're lucky my jacket was saved. Otherwise I would have been very cross with you," Jay said with mock solemnity.
"I'm still mortified about how that went. Gav feels absolutely awful about Yan's behaviour and wants to make it up to you somehow. If we'd known he was going to be such a complete ass, we never would have brought him."
"He seemed a bit arrogant, but I didn't expect him to be so unpleasant."
"He can be at times, but it's never quite that bad. Gav is furious because he actually had high hopes about the evening, and Yan effectively ruined his chances with all three women. He's still moping about it."
"What happened after I left?"
"Gav was relieved you weren't interested in dating, made his own chances better, you know? But Yan monopolized all the women's attention and was insufferable on top of it. Unforgivable, really."
"No real harm done. Though I'm never agreeing to another blind date arrangement. I don't want to kill the vibe with my funeral director smile."
Luc laughed. "Don't listen to Yan. Though in retrospect, you did look a bit... intimidating. No wonder the women were too shy to approach you."
Jay was surprised. This was news to him—he'd been called many things in his life, but never that. "Intimidating?"
"Maybe Ian's rubbing off on you," Luc added with a grin.
"What about Ana? How did things work out with her?"
"We'll see how it goes. I'm not sure I want anything serious right now. Happy just dating around, keeping things casual."
"That's probably wise."
"But seriously, Gav is determined to organize some kind of apology event. He feels responsible for the fiasco."
"That's completely unnecessary. I just want to forget the whole thing happened."
Luc adopted a tragic expression. "Gav will never live this down if you don't let him make amends. He's actually considering moving out of the apartment from shame."
"Now you're just emotionally blackmailing me."
"Is it working?"
"Absolutely not."
"What if we made it fun? Invited your gym friends, found something everyone would enjoy?"
Jay narrowed his eyes suspiciously. "Are you trying to poach my trainer?"
"You saw right through my elaborate plot."
Jay fled the kitchen before Luc could extract any commitments, leaving his colleague laughing behind him.
After lunch, Jay called the real estate agent Ian had recommended. He was immediately accommodating, listening to Jay's requirements and budget constraints.
"I think I can show you several excellent options that might not have appeared in your previous searches. Different neighbourhoods, some properties that are just coming on the market. When would be convenient for viewings?"
They arranged to meet Friday afternoon, giving him time to compile a selection of suitable apartments.
That evening, Jay stayed late at the office, joining Ian for their renewed tradition of afternoon coffee in the kitchen. After a week of apartment hunting that had kept him away from the office each evening, it felt comforting to return to the overtime work.
"I'm afraid I'm starting to be more like you. Finding solace in working late."
Ian laughed. "That's an awful development."
"At least the place is pleasant. After a whole week of visiting properties, it feels nice to take it easy here."
"How did the call with the real estate agent go?"
"He seemed very helpful. We're meeting Friday afternoon to look at several places. And Luc filled me in on the weekend aftermath—apparently Gav is still angry about Yan's behavior."
Ian was content hearing that Jay's tormentor had faced some consequences, however minor, and that the weekend's drama had resolved without lasting damage. "I'm glad things worked out reasonably well in the end." 
"Luc said I looked intimidating at the restaurant. Do I really come across that way?"
"Not at all. But you definitely appear far more confident than you did a year ago."
"Is that good or bad?"
"Entirely good. You've grown into yourself. It's obvious to everyone around you."
They chatted about various work matters for a while before going back to their respective desks.
Jay returned home around nine that evening, spending the remainder of his time browsing online for relaxing weekend activities. Nothing particularly caught his attention—most suggestions seemed either too elaborate or too mundane for what he had in mind.
He still had several days to plan something appropriate for Ian's forced day of rest. The challenge was finding activities that would engage someone who seemed to find fulfilment primarily through productive work. He wanted to choose something Ian would enjoy, not just endure out of politeness. The pressure to make it perfect was probably excessive, but Jay was unable to approach the task casually.
As he scrolled through various entertainment options, Jay pondered on Ian's observation about his increased confidence. Looking back at his early days at the company, he could see the point. The anxious, uncertain person who had started working for Ian bore little resemblance to the man who now felt comfortable enough to insert himself into his boss's weekend plans. 
Perhaps that change really did make all the difference in how others perceived him. Whether it was sustainable or advisable remained to be seen, but Jay was no longer particularly concerned about such practical considerations.
Scene 2
Great social transgression
The next day Jay left work at five to head to the gym. Throughout the day, Luc had been casting him pointed glances, but thankfully hadn't pressed the issue of his promised apology for the unfortunate evening.
This time, Ian wasn't even melancholy about Jay's early departure. "Have a good session," he said cheerfully. He was sustained by the vision of their weekend together, and the anticipation made the early departure tolerable, if barely.
At the gym, Rus immediately pounced on him for details.
"So how did the date go? You look like you survived it at least."
Jay made a point of complaining about it for the entire session. "The man insulted me repeatedly, calling me a funeral director. The women completely ignored me. The drinks were awful, the pub was impossibly loud, and my best suit got ruined when someone spilled wine all over it."
"That sounds terrible."
"It was. Then I got stupidly drunk trying to salvage what was left of the evening and had such a terrible hangover I almost missed work the next day. I told you I didn't want to go."
He didn't mention a word about Ian, knowing Rus disapproved, but dramatized every detail to emphasize that he had been right not to want to go.
Rus got the message clearly. "I'm sorry I pushed you into it. How about we do something fun next weekend to make up for it?"
Jay laughed. "Luc already made the same suggestion, but no thanks. I've already made plans, and these plans definitely don't involve getting humiliated."
"Plans? What kind of plans?"
"The kind that don't involve blind dates," Jay replied, deflecting with a smile.
Rus pressed for more details, but Jay remained mysteriously silent about his weekend arrangements.
When he returned home, Jay realized he had not only made weekend plans with his boss, but he was being secretive about it. He felt it was important that absolutely no one could know, as if he was committing some great social transgression. He suspected that a subordinate fraternizing with his boss to this extent could be seen as problematic.
The secrecy should have been alarming, but instead it felt thrilling. The sensation was so unlike anything he had ever experienced that it gave him a momentary pause, but he quickly dismissed his concerns. There was no point in overthinking any of it. For once in his life, it was a moment to act, not analyse.
After three hours of browsing websites and reading reviews, he threw up his hands in frustration and decided to abandon his quest for the perfect itinerary. Instead, he would simply take Ian to do things Jay himself enjoyed. 
A scenic ferry ride along the river, where they could watch the city drift by from the water. A visit to a restaurant that served seasonal dishes for a lunch made from fresh pumpkins. Then the botanical garden he loved, where the autumn trees had turned deep red and gold, creating a spectacular display just before the leaves fell completely.
The plan felt right, personal. He just hoped the weather would cooperate, because otherwise their outdoor activities could quickly turn cold and gloomy.
He went to sleep pleased with his decision, even ecstatic. As he drifted off, he thought it was going to be perfect. A lovely autumn date with Ian. Wait. Not a date. Just an outing.
But the thought of it being a date made his heart race unexpectedly, and he fell asleep smiling at his own foolishness for entertaining such ideas.
The next day at work, Luc approached Jay conspiratorially.
"There's this amazing bar with a fantastic entertainment show this weekend. Perfect atmosphere, great drinks, very peaceful. What do you say?"
"I already have plans that absolutely cannot be changed," Jay replied.
Luc looked sceptical. "You never have plans. Do these plans involve the gym and industry reading?"
"I made arrangements with friends already, and I'm not going to change them. Tell Gav he doesn't need to blame himself or fret about Saturday night. It's forgotten."
"Friends? What friends?"
"Friends who make plans that don't require apologizing afterwards."
From his office, Ian had been listening to this exchange with glee. Jay was defending their weekend plans against social pressure, prioritizing their time together over other opportunities. The joy that made him feel was probably disproportionate to the circumstances, but he was unable to care.
Wednesday and Thursday, Jay worked late with Ian, sharing their daily coffee conversations in the kitchen and leaving together around eight. Both were in rather good moods, laughing at each other's jokes and seeming to find everything more amusing than usual.
On Friday, Jay had his meeting with the agent and left at five. Ian was so excited about the weekend that he left home early as well, because staying at work felt unbearable.
Jay met the agent in the city centre next to a property. He was a short, cheerful fellow in an elegant suit with an exaggerated smile. He drove Jay around in his expensive sedan, showing about ten different apartments and handing Jay a folder containing specifications with photos and floor plans of each place, clearly meticulously prepared.
The apartments were a bit over Jay's budget and, while nice, not quite nice enough to justify the price. But Jay still studied all the listings and added his own notes. He told the agent which ones he liked and why.
In the last place they visited, they had a conversation about Jay's ideal apartment.
"I'd love a good view and a balcony, but well designed floor plan and good transit access are most important. I'd like plenty of storage space and a bathroom that can fit a washing machine. I value functionality, but I'd like the space to feel welcoming."
The agent was extremely enthusiastic about this information, even suspiciously so. They arranged to meet the following week for another set of places that would take into account everything Jay had said.
Jay selected three he liked the most and added them to his list. The neighbourhoods were a bit too posh for his tastes, but the apartments themselves were acceptable.
As he rode the metro home, his thoughts quickly moved away from housing logistics. Tomorrow he would go to Ian's apartment. The prospect overwhelmed every other consideration.
Scene 3
Weekend work
Jay dealt with all the most pressing chores on Friday evening, doing laundry and cleaning his apartment. On Saturday morning, he finished the remaining tasks before heading to the gym. He was unusually energetic, which didn't escape Rus's notice.
"You're practically bouncing off the walls. Do your mysterious plans involve an actual date?"
Jay couldn't suppress a giggle. "No, definitely no date whatsoever."
This response only cemented Rus's suspicion, but he dropped the subject. Jay left the gym in high spirits and showered very thoroughly before dressing in one of his standard office suits and taking a taxi to the address Ian had given him.
Really, a day working with his boss in his free time should not be something he looked forward to this much, and yet here he was.
When he arrived, Jay evaluated the neighbourhood. It was definitely upscale, but not as upscale as he had imagined. He had thought Ian would live in one of the most prestigious districts of the city, but the area was closer to the financial district than to the exclusive Heights where old money resided. Perhaps practical considerations took precedence. The district was by the river and had plenty of green spaces though, so Jay approved.
At precisely noon, as arranged, Jay rang Ian's bell. Ian's voice came through the intercom immediately, as if he had been waiting nearby.
"Come up. Twentieth floor."
Ian met him at the apartment door, immaculately dressed as always. Jay had wondered if Ian might wear something more casual at home, but of course not. He probably didn't even own casual clothes.
Ian's penthouse was on one of the top floors of the building, with a large living room overlooking the city and a separate kitchen. 
"Coffee?" Ian asked after they exchanged their customary greetings.
Jay nodded, setting up a workspace at the dining table and unpacking his laptop. He noticed the painting on the wall—the same one he had admired at the company art exhibition they had attended together. It brought back pleasant memories.
"I remember that painting. From the art show," Jay said when Ian returned with coffee.
"I thought it would liven up the space."
Ian already had his computer set up at the opposite end of the table, and soon they went to work. Ian showed Jay what he was working on—mostly technical tasks involving spreadsheet templates and data organization. They divided the work and started tackling it, chatting occasionally about casual topics.
It was the first time they had worked so closely together. While Jay normally sat outside Ian's office in fairly close proximity, they had always been divided by a glass wall. Now they could see each other easily whenever either looked up, and could talk without having to raise their voices.
For Jay, sitting in Ian's personal space like this made his skin tingle. He stole glances around the apartment and at Ian when he moved from one section to another, breathing in the scent of something fresh—maybe apple and spice. Probably an air freshener, but subtle enough that it was barely noticeable.
After an hour, Ian announced, "I'll make lunch."
Jay wanted to protest but just nodded. "Do you need any help?"
"I'll be done in a few minutes."
Jay got up and stretched, savouring the opportunity to move freely through Ian's living space. Eating Ian's homemade food felt almost decadent. Their shared breakfast had been divine, and Jay's anticipation was considerable.
Ian returned within ten minutes with two plates of pasta with mushrooms and herbs. "I prepared everything beforehand and just had to cook it quickly. Various pastas with seasonal ingredients are my go-to meals when I cook for myself."
Jay ate with delight, and of course it was delicious. He offered to clean up, but Ian waved him off.
"My housekeeper comes daily and takes care of whatever needs attention."
"Even on Sundays?"
"Yes. May is an older lady who's been with me for years. She finishes the work in at most two hours on most days, and since she's my full-time employee without other work, she insists on ensuring the house is spotless at all times."
Jay thought it was nice that Ian had someone taking care of him, and he wasn't surprised that people who worked for Ian were so fiercely loyal.
They returned to work afterwards, and Jay focused properly to accomplish as much as possible. He was no stranger to tedious and repetitive tasks, and had plenty of experience working weekends since starting at Turner & Associates. He was making excellent progress.
"You don't need to go quite so hard at it. It's not urgent," Ian commented.
Jay insisted, "I need to ensure you have nothing on your mind tomorrow, so as much of this needs to be finished today as possible. Preferably all of it."
Ian smiled to himself. "Alright then, let's do our best."
After another hour, Jay asked if they should have more coffee, and Ian agreed. Jay followed him to the kitchen, which was bigger than expected and quite well-stocked for someone who didn't cook regularly.
"May rotates the selection and brings whatever gets uneaten home, so nothing goes to waste. The produce often reflects her tastes. I'm sometimes in the mood for something different from my standard meal plan, and I cook occasionally to maintain the skill."
"I doubt cooking is like violin playing. It doesn't atrophy that much."
"I'm not entirely sure about that. Plus it's relaxing to do something different occasionally. The uneaten meal containers get delivered to the community kitchen by May the next day, so I don't worry about waste."
Jay approved of the sustainability. "That's thoughtful."
"My experience of finding myself one day with absolutely nothing was eye-opening about the value of charity and avoiding waste."
Ian prepared coffee using a high-end but relatively standard machine. Jay evaluated the setup with an appraiser's eye. "I should think about getting a coffee machine for my new apartment."
"Absolutely. Having space for conveniences should be one of your priorities. There's no reason for you to suffer discomfort—you've had enough of that already."
They returned to work, and Ian brought out a fresh fruit platter with sliced varieties that were quite diverse, courtesy of May.
"She was quite happy I'm having visitors. It doesn't happen very often."
"She'd be less happy if she knew it's just a coworker doing literal weekend overtime."
"May claims it's important to eat lots of fruits, and a big variety. I don't disagree. Cut fruits appear in my diet frequently."
As time passed, they took more frequent breaks, talking about food and housing. Soon eight o'clock arrived, and Ian announced the end of the workday.
"We accomplished quite a bit," Jay agreed.
"Let me take you to dinner. It's the least I can do," Ian proposed.
Ian drove them to a nearby restaurant he frequented. He recommended the steak, which Jay ordered, while Ian chose grilled salmon.
"Steak is an occasional indulgence. I save it for business dinners. I need all the help I can get to survive them."
"You don't seem like someone who has problems with the social demands of your job."
"There's a good reason Leo handles most client relations. I can manage them when necessary, and do it well, but it's not exactly my favourite activity. I much prefer the comfort of being alone with numbers."
Jay pondered this for a moment. "Did my company today distract you from your numbers?"
"Not at all. I never realized what help a skilled assistant could be until I met you. After the Sam Connelly situation, I was certain assistants of any sort were only a liability."
Jay was hesitant, but curiousity won and he asked, "Was Sam a good assistant?"
Ian laughed, though without much humour. "Not remotely. Back then I thought he was, but that was due to my inexperience. He spent most of his time distracting me from work that needed to be done. At the time, that felt... exciting. But I was simply foolish."
Jay didn't want the evening to turn sombre by revisiting old wounds, but he was secretly pleased that Ian opened up to him like this. Ian seemed to recognize the sensitive territory and quickly changed the subject.
"Since we're mostly finished with the main course, shall we look at desserts?"
Jay winced. "You seemed so health-conscious twenty minutes ago while ordering, and now you want desserts?"
Ian laughed. "I like desserts, but let's go for their roasted fruits with honey. They're excellent and not too unhealthy."
They did, and Jay agreed they were delicious.
"I prefer the fruity and nutty options," Ian said.
Jay made a mental note—this seemed like important information.
Ian then drove Jay home, and as Jay left the car, he said, "See you tomorrow. I'll pick you up at eleven. We're taking public transport, so brace yourself."
"Sounds fine. I'll be ready."
They parted ways, both pleased with how the day had gone.

Jay dressed that morning in one of his best suits—and the boldest of his selection, the tailored burgundy three-piece that made him look like old world royalty. He selected a black tie with subtle but striking patterns, combed his hair to perfection, and regretted that he had never researched cologne. His dress watch was the only jewellery he wore, and he looked at it with warmth—the gift from Ian, matching his outfit perfectly. Tie pins or cufflinks would have completed the look, but he was too inexperienced with men's fashion to add such touches.
Still, he was reasonably satisfied with the effect. He looked good.
He took a taxi to Ian's building and arrived five minutes early to find Ian already waiting near the entrance. Jay stepped out to collect him, and they rode together to the ferry port.
The weather was perfect. November chill was in the air, but it was sunny enough that no coats were needed, and Jay felt relieved.
"I'm eternally grateful we have nice autumns. I'd hate it if the weather ruined my plans," Jay remarked as they rode.
"What exactly are these mysterious plans?"
"Nothing too exciting, so don't get your hopes up. Mostly boat rides and walks in public gardens."
"At least my forced time off is leisurely. I was half-worried you'd drag me to a fencing session."
Jay laughed. "You're completely safe. No strenuous physical activity planned. It's a rest from your gym regimen as well."
They reached the river port quickly thanks to light weekend traffic. Jay led the way to a large ferry with a small cafe on the upper deck. They made themselves comfortable, and Jay explained it was a two-hour ride upstream through the more industrial part of the city. They ordered coffees and soon the boat departed.
"Have you ever taken the scenic ferry ride?" Jay asked.
"No, I haven't. I was born in this city and have lived here most of my life, but it never occurred to me. It wasn't an activity people did in my circles, and I never deviated from expectations."
"I'm sorry if it's too plebeian, but I love it. I took it my first year after moving to the city and several times afterwards. The gentle rocking is relaxing and the views are quite nice. The city looks different from this perspective, and the parts by the river are the best-maintained areas. It probably makes me a country bumpkin for still being impressed after so many years, but I can't help it."
"It's quite charming," Ian said, watching the autumn scenery drift past. "The fall colors really are lovely."
They chatted about their pastimes. Jay told Ian about his first several boat rides, though most had been solitary and unremarkable. Ian shared stories from his youth.
"Besides violin and fencing, I enjoyed tennis. I also rode horses, though it wasn't my favorite. Nothing wrong with it, I just wasn't a horse person. We went skiing as a family, but I haven't done that in years. I still play tennis regularly, and I'm quite fond of swimming. My apartment complex has an outdoor pool that I use frequently in summer."
Time passed quickly with conversation and sightseeing, and they soon reached their destination. The restaurant Jay had chosen was not far, and they walked through charming streets.
It was a bistro with a large outdoor patio decorated for the season, with apples and pumpkins arranged in rustic baskets. They ordered seasonal classics: thick pumpkin soup with freshly baked garlic bread, pickled pumpkins, baked potatoes, and pumpkin pie for dessert. The meal was hearty but fresh, and a bonfire in the backyard brought nostalgic scents to Jay.
"We used to have bonfires like this regularly when I was growing up. Very popular in my part of the country. There's something magical about the smell of burning leaves and wood."
The atmosphere was pastoral, and Jay thought they stood out from the local crowd in their elegant suits, but he didn't mind at all.
After lunch, Jay led them to the metro and they traveled several stops to a botanical garden. Jay guided Ian through the paths, showing him his favorite spots. There was a refreshment stand in the center where Jay bought them caramelized apples on sticks, then led Ian to a secluded bench by a small pond.
"You'll need to eat carefully to avoid staining your suit," Jay warned, then retrieved a bag of seeds from his jacket. He handed half to Ian with instructions on duck feeding.
"You want me to feed ducks?" Ian asked, looking bemused.
"Naturally. It's a perfectly respectable Sunday afternoon activity," Jay replied with a deadpan expression,  demonstrating the proper seed-scattering technique.
Ian imitated him, and they watched ducks flock to the food, quacking enthusiastically.
"I do this regularly. Low cost, pleasant hobby. I always make a point of feeding the ducks at least once during vacation time. Since I don't really travel, I've made it my mission to find local activities that can be done on a budget. Duck feeding ranks quite high on that list. What did you do for fun during your studio years?"
"Nothing," Ian replied simply.
"You couldn't have done absolutely nothing."
"I never allowed myself time off. Only work, gym, occasionally tennis if I felt generous. I played violin too, but only after several years when I finally bought an instrument. By then my skill had degraded massively."
Jay felt heartbroken hearing this, and the urge to embrace Ian again overwhelmed him. But without his previous hangover-induced bravado, he lacked the courage.
Jay looked at the early setting sun, golden light making the red leaves even deeper in color. "Well, those days are over. For as long as I'm your assistant, I'll make it my mission to ensure you take proper breaks and enjoy life. Even if I have to force, trick, or manipulate you into it."
Ian laughed at Jay's solemn expression. "You're free to try, but I should warn you—I'm pretty stubborn."
They sat feeding ducks until darkness and chill set in, then Jay proposed dinner. They took the subway toward Jay's neighborhood—a rather long ride, but Sunday trains were fairly empty so they sat comfortably.
"Are you uncomfortable with so much subway time?" Jay asked.
"Not at all. I'm quite acquainted with the transit system. It feels a bit nostalgic. I don't miss living in that studio, but the experience wasn't entirely negative. Character-building, eye-opening, humbling in constructive ways. I grew up very sheltered with narrow perspectives. The circumstances that expanded my worldview were harrowing, but the growth itself was valuable."
Jay was struck by Ian's mature perspective. Truly the mark of a great man—to lose everything and still see the silver lining.
Jay chose a restaurant he knew well, more rustic and folk-oriented than Ian's usual establishments, but Jay found it charming. He recommended cabbage rolls.
"My grandmother used to make them just like these," he said.
Ian had never eaten anything similar. It wasn't bad—definitely an interesting experience.
When evening fell for good, Ian thanked Jay for the day. "This was definitely novel. I'll take a taxi home from here."
"I hope it wasn't too disappointing."
"Not at all."
Jay felt slightly sheepish, suspecting this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity unlikely to repeat. But even so, he was glad he had convinced Ian to stop working, if only for one day, even if it was just to feed ducks.
He walked home through the cold evening air, thinking he would treasure this moment—the day he convinced his distinguished boss to ride ferries and walk through parks with him.
Yet when he returned home, Jay felt profoundly sad. At Ian's isolation, at getting only this small glimpse of him as a person before they returned to their respective roles. He lay in bed, overwhelmed by melancholy, as if something precious had been taken from him.
Scene 5
Gloom
The next Monday was unusually heavy for Jay. Nothing was really wrong, and he worked beside Ian all day, seeing him from dawn until dusk. But it felt different. There was a glass wall between them now, both literal and metaphorical. They were not friends, certainly not anything more than that. They were coworkers, brought together by circumstances and held in place by the thin context of their working arrangements.
It felt suffocating somehow.
For one brief Sunday afternoon, they had sat as equals sharing mundane experiences that had felt extraordinary. Jay knew it was an illusion, but it had been so beautiful he couldn't bring himself to let it go.
During their afternoon coffee, Ian asked, "Is anything wrong? You seem quiet today."
"It's nothing. Just realizing that autumn is ending, making me feel nostalgic."
Jay didn't know how to voice what was bothering him without sounding greedy and ungrateful. He also didn't want to burden this wonderful man with his foolish feelings.
They worked long hours that day, until nine, then until ten, neither moving from their desks despite barely accomplishing anything meaningful. Both felt untethered, reluctant to part ways but unwilling to say it aloud. Finally it became unfeasible to prolong the evening further, and they left, barely looking at each other, as if afraid of what they might see in each other's eyes.
Jay completely abandoned dinner that day. They hadn't ordered anything, he had nothing prepared at home, it was late, and frankly he wasn't that hungry. He just showered and went straight to bed.
The next day was Tuesday, so Jay left at five to go to the gym, leaving Ian alone in his office. Ian took it unusually hard. His one weekend alone with Jay was over, and it had been amazing, but now it was in the past and Ian had nothing more to sustain him. Nothing to hope for, nothing to wait for. Just the reality of watching Jay leave for other arrangements involving other people, friends and companions who occupied the spaces in Jay's life that Ian could never claim.
And Ian had nothing. Just the dull ache in his chest and the knowledge that this was as much as he would ever get. The scraps of attention from his assistant who was too kind for his own good, who had taken pity on his pathetic boss and arranged entertainment because it was too sad to watch him work constantly.
Ian accomplished nothing that evening. He simply sat in his office, brooding.
At the gym, Jay was distracted and sighing frequently.
"Was the date a failure?" Rus asked.
"It wasn't a date, and no, it was wonderful," Jay replied, then sighed deeply. "Rus, have you ever met someone so perfect you knew you'd never be able to measure up to them?"
Rus laughed. "Ah, so you got rejected. Look, you're a great guy, and whoever turned you down is blind and doesn't understand what they had."
Jay shook his head and decided against trying to untangle this misunderstanding. "You don't understand."
"Don't worry. You'll meet someone even better."
"I seriously doubt it."
"How about we plan something fun for this weekend? Cheer you up, get you back out there."
"Yeah, I don't want to sit at home alone and overthink."
"I'll let you know what we're doing. Reserve Saturday afternoon."
Jay just nodded and sighed again, this time even more deeply.
He returned home feeling foolish. Rus had gotten a completely wrong idea, and his melancholy was for an entirely different reason. It was just that Ian was exceptional, and Jay was blessed to be able to stay close to him. But at the same time, he knew he couldn't be farther away from him, and it felt painful.
He should have made dinner, but once again he didn't feel like it. He just sat on his couch and sighed, then took a really long shower and went to bed early.
On Wednesday morning he felt groggy and sluggish. Skipping dinner two consecutive nights was reckless and foolish. He had promised himself to take better care of himself, to not disappoint Ian, to stand by his side no matter what. He couldn't allow his confusion to impact his well-being.
He ate double breakfast and that same day booked his seasonal vaccination that he had been planning to get. During lunch, he ordered an unusually large portion.
"Someone's hungry today," Amy observed as Jay attacked his meal.
"I was too lazy to cook and skipped dinner, so I need to make up for it," Jay explained to general team amusement.
"You're looking gloomy these days," Luc observed. "Are you still upset about that evening? Because if so, Gav is still hoping to organize an apology event, maybe this weekend."
"I have plans."
"You're lying. There's no way you're having plans two weekends in a row."
"It's with Rus this time."
Luc looked offended. "You'll make plans with your gym trainer but not with your favourite coworker?"
Jay managed a weak smile. "Maybe some other time."
Jay stayed late that day again, tackling non-urgent issues. The next day he had another apartment viewing, so he was going to leave at a normal hour and wanted to avoid any backlog.
There was a slight undercurrent of tension between him and Ian that went unacknowledged but was deeply felt. Last week had been joyous, but now very little of that joy remained, and they were both subdued. They both blamed it on the weather—as November slowly ended, nice days were few and far between, with temperatures reaching ten degrees, gloomy skies, and darkness falling early.
Both were aware it was deeper than weather for them, even though neither realized the other was taking it equally poorly. They exchanged strained smiles as they returned to their desks to finish the workday.
This time they left at eight, and Jay finally cooked dinner and ate, but it tasted like nothing at all. He hoped he wasn't catching some illness.
The weight in his chest remained, a constant ache he couldn't understand. He only knew that something precious felt just out of reach, and the distance between what was and what could never be seemed to grow larger with each passing day.
Chapter 29: Choices
Scene 1
The perfect apartment
Thursday's apartment viewing began with the same cheerfulness the agent had displayed during their previous meeting. His smile was even more pronounced as he guided Jay through the first few properties.
Jay was increasingly confused. The part of the city they were touring wasn't one he would have selected, and the listings were above his stated budget range. When he voiced these concerns, the agent smiled apologetically.
"Your budget can definitely accommodate these options if you're willing to make some concessions. This area is truly worth the sacrifice."
The next listing was less impressive, a cramped space with an impossibly long corridor and a bathroom barely large enough for one person, though it was more reasonably priced.
The agent shook his head with sadness. "Naturally, more modest options are available in this area, but compromises must be made."
They drove further into the district, approaching the river, and Jay began recognizing the surroundings. Ian lived somewhere nearby. They stopped beside a beautiful new building overlooking a charming park and the water beyond.
The agent's smile became positively radiant. "Now this is something special."
The building's interior was tastefully finished, and they rode the elevator to the fourth floor. Following a small corridor, they entered a brand-new unit that took Jay's breath away.
The apartment was fully furnished. The paint scheme featured peaceful, muted earth tones that complemented dark wooden floors throughout. Enormous windows flooded the space with natural light, and a balcony offered spectacular river views.
Despite being compact, the floor plan felt spacious and brilliantly designed. A huge closet was cleverly integrated into the small entryway, maximizing storage without overwhelming the entrance. The bedroom had just enough space for a proper bed and wide closet. The kitchenette was built into the wall, with modern appliances and plenty of counters despite the modest size, and with cupboards extending to the ceiling.
The living room featured a corner couch that looked both stylish and comfortable, a mounted television with a stand holding small plants, and a coffee table that didn't dominate the space. A dining table with four chairs was positioned to stay out of the way while still leaving room for a proper desk and decent-sized bookshelf.
The bathroom impressed Jay most of all. It contained both a walk-in shower and a bathtub, with a washing machine and dryer built into custom paneling that concealed them completely. Multiple drawers extended to the ceiling, providing abundant storage without cluttering the visual space.
The balcony featured an outdoor patio sofa with cushions and a small table perfect for morning coffee. Throughout the apartment, plush rugs and strategically placed plants created an atmosphere that was cosy and welcoming.
Jay walked through the space in awe. Of all the properties he had seen, this one was unquestionably the most beautiful, furnished with brand-new pieces arranged so competently that he wouldn't change a single detail.
The agent began his sales presentation, highlighting every amenity with theatrical gestures.
"Look at this perfectly fitted dishwasher! The cupboards maximize storage capacity beyond what you'd expect for the square meters. Notice how much counter space we've achieved."
He continued his tour with growing excitement. "The corner sofa is impossibly soft yet durable. It opens for emergency sleeping arrangements and could comfortably accommodate three guests. The bedroom closet is enormous, you could easily fit clothes for at least two people!"
Jay had to admit he wasn't exaggerating. Every claim was demonstrably accurate.
"The modern air conditioning utilizes the latest technology. Superior heating and insulation ensures low costs. The parks in this area are magnificent, the one next door is decent sized, and there are two more within walking distance. Multiple cafes and grocery stores nearby, plus two highly regarded restaurants. The metro station is a nine-minute walk, which might not be the most convenient, and it's not on one of the main lines. However, it provides direct service to the financial district, and the route passes through parkland, making it practically a wellness activity!"
The agent was clearly downplaying cons while highlighting pros, and with each sentence Jay became both more charmed and more distrustful. He was starting to suspect either a scam or an astronomical price, so when the agent began another tirade about advanced technologies, Jay gently interrupted.
"What's the price?"
The agent's smile became even more brilliant. "This is a special opportunity exclusively for valued partners at Turner & Associates. Unavailable on the general market, with a personal discount from our agency owner. One and a half million."
It was... suspiciously cheap. Still above Jay's budget of one million plus or minus twenty percent, but potentially manageable if he included his annual bonus. Based on previous presentations, however, properties of this calibre in this location should cost at least twice that amount.
Jay narrowed his eyes. "Was someone murdered here? Is this an unlucky number? Flooding risk?"
The agent looked offended. "Nothing of the sort! I would never compromise my reputation. Ian Hagen himself is guaranteeing my honesty in this transaction."
The mention of Ian was reassuring. Ian had recommended him personally, and no one would dare tarnish his name. But the offer was still not only too good to be true, it seemed like the agent had been building up to this from the beginning.
Jay walked through the apartment two more times. It was beautiful. He could see himself drinking morning coffee on that balcony. There was enough floor space between the living room and entrance to lay down a yoga mat for morning exercise, which he did occasionally but had stopped due to space constraints. He could probably host his entire family if he slept on the floor himself. Ian would have a comfortable place to sleep when he stayed over again...
Wait. He wasn't allowed to think such thoughts.
But speaking of Ian, this was his general area, wasn't it? He'd have to check the map when he got home.
Jay thanked the agent and headed to the metro station, exploring the vicinity. The river was close but situated in a small valley, making flooding unlikely. The park was lovely, with variety of trees and bushes and clearly fresh pavement. Well-dressed people moved about, as expected in such an upscale area, but not to the point of being intimidating.
He entered one of the recommended restaurants and ordered their apparently famous seared trout, which was decent, though Jay wasn't sure it was worth the hype evident from teenagers taking selfies at every second table.
He took the metro home, but it required changing trains in the financial district. This was a further part of town, away from the central metro network he was accustomed to. From his current station, he could take three lines practically halfway across the city. He was quite fond of the convenience, and it was less than five minutes from home.
Returning to his studio, which now looked awfully depressing in comparison, Jay realized the apartment he'd just seen was only eighteen square meters bigger, but seemed twice as spacious. And he'd already thought his studio had pretty well-conceptualized space allocation.
He looked up the area on his city map. Ian lived only a twelve-minute walk away. He could probably see Ian's building if he looked carefully enough.
He sighed heavily. It was too good to be true. It was also outside his financial comfort zone. Admittedly a restrictively tight zone, but he remained cautious about his financial security. And he couldn't shake the feeling that this was another elaborate plot, just like his hiring.
But he couldn't understand what the endgame was supposed to be.
Scene 2
Manipulation
The next morning at work, Jay was still torn about the apartment. During the briefing in Ian's office, as they finished with the day's agenda, Jay hesitated for a moment before leaving, then asked, "Can I take a moment with a personal matter?"
"Naturally," Ian replied.
"How trustworthy is the agent you recommended?"
Ian felt his pulse quicken. "I wouldn't recommend him if I wasn't certain about his reliability. Was there a problem?"
"Not a problem exactly, but he showed me a listing that's ridiculously attractive, half the market price, and it happens to be twelve minutes away from where you live."
Ian's heart skipped a beat. He had instructed the agent that if he could get Jay to move within walking distance, he would be properly rewarded, but to be absolutely discreet about it. Now he feared his frankly elementary scheme was completely transparent.
"The real estate market can be unpredictable. Connections are often half the battle in finding good opportunities," Ian said with forced casualness.
Jay sighed deeply, thinking. "Is it once again my closeness to you propping me up?" He looked at Ian with a slightly miserable expression. "I can't possibly accept sliding on your coattails so much."
Ian tried to control his voice to sound calm and patient. "Your current employment has many demands. Frequent long hours, incredibly stressful periods, constant need for impeccable conduct and presentation, highest standards of performance. But there are also benefits, and the pay is only one of them. Connections come as another, and you're well within your rights to make use of them. That's compensation for the unreasonable requirements."
Jay wasn't entirely convinced, but dropped the subject and returned to work.
During lunch that day, he showed the listing to the whole team, illustrating his concerns. Almost everyone was quite enthusiastic, with Zoe being the most excited.
"It's an absolute steal! You cannot let this offer go," she insisted.
Only Max was visibly less impressed. "It's far too small to live comfortably long-term. You'll outgrow it within a year."
Luc commented diplomatically. "It's quaint, I suppose."
Jay disregarded him completely since his tastes were unorthodox at best. The rest of the team agreed it was a great deal, with Kim being just as suspicious as Jay.
"It's likely Ian's name can open many doors. Being the CFO's assistant is an underrated position. Maybe I should have gone for it as well."
Jay remained undecided. Despite it being Friday and not having many tasks, he stayed late with Ian, mostly browsing different units and comparing prices. For the general area, the price was incredibly low, and places this beautiful were rare on the market.
Ian approached him on the way to coffee, trying to sound casual. "Are you considering the place?"
"I honestly don't know. I have a bad feeling about it, and it's not in my comfortable budget."
"Your comfortable budget is conservative for someone with your salary," Ian remarked.
Jay grew quiet, finally saying, "It's hard for me to get rid of my initial levels of frugality." He didn't want to admit to Ian that he didn't trust the stability of his position.
They went to get coffee, and Ian changed the subject. "Do you have weekend plans?"
"Yeah, I'm going out with Rus."
 "That sounds enjoyable."
While Ian wished him fun, secretly his mood darkened. Jay rarely had plans before, but now it seemed he regularly spent time with his gym trainer turned friend. Ian felt desperate, and before returning to his desk, took a gamble.
"If you want my advice, you should take the apartment. You can afford it, and I can recommend a bank that will give you attractive mortgage conditions."
"I can't possibly impose any more than I already have."
"You not only can, you absolutely should. You've seized every opportunity that presented itself to your advantage and are all the better for it. You should continue to do so. This is the time for you to arrange the life you want to live, so you need to be decisive."
The speech came out more grandiose than intended, but Ian wanted to make his point, to push Jay toward this decision. It felt bitter to be so manipulative, trying to engineer proximity while compromising his own integrity. But his need for Jay was stronger than his discomfort with his methods.
Jay returned to his desk with coffee and more conflicted feelings. He trusted Ian's judgment and knew he was probably right. But Jay wasn’t Ian. Ian was brave, unbreakable. When his life had collapsed once already, he had clawed his way back and rebuilt it from the ashes. Jay knew he couldn’t do that. He was terrified of making a wrong call, of misjudging the situation and making a mistake that would cost him more than he could bear. If he fell, he wouldn’t have the strength to rise again. That fear clung to him, even as he tried to let Ian’s assurance steady him.
The memories of the moment he discovered the circumstances that got him his position surfaced—the humiliation of being used as a pawn, of being the laughingstock of the whole company. It made him stop in his tracks.
Things had turned out okay so far. But had they really? The feeling of playing a role he didn't understand returned, and his wariness skyrocketed.
He could sense the undercurrent of manipulation in the air, subtle but impossible to ignore. Lately, he’d been feeling good, secure. His initial doubts had faded, replaced by a cautious trust in the path unfolding before him. But Jay knew too well that when something felt too good to be true, it always was. There had to be strings attached. He just couldn’t tell who held them, or what end they were pulling toward.
He would have to think about it. Maybe ask other people, make a detailed list, research more. He didn't need to decide right away. There was still time to think it through.
For now, he would go home and consider it. Tomorrow maybe he would consult Rus. At least Rus seemed to have his wellbeing in mind, even if his ideas were sometimes misguided.
Scene 3
Adventures with friends
On Saturday morning, Jay went to the gym as always. Between sets, he asked Rus about his apartment predicament.
"I'm searching for a place to buy because my current rental is tiny. The search was going so-so, but the agent I got introduced to through work is showing me a perfect place that fits my dream vision, for a low price—an absolute steal. It has some minor issues I could potentially overlook, like being on the far end of the city, near the posh heights and away from the center with less convenient metro access. But it feels too good to be true."
Rus pondered this for a moment. "If you move there, you'll stop coming to this gym."
That was true enough—the transit wouldn't be convenient, and Jay would definitely find something closer. He felt connected to his current neighborhood, and uprooting himself held no appeal.
"No matter," Rus continued. "We can still meet outside the gym. You don't really need a trainer anymore—you could manage on your own, you know the drill."
"You motivate me to stay consistent. I don't want to change trainers."
"You shouldn't let the neighborhood tie you down. We can always stay friends and keep in touch outside the gym. It may feel good to stay in the same place, but it can also lead to stagnation. You have a chance to upgrade your life. You got this opportunity through your work and should seize it. At least you'll get something out of all those stressful quarterly periods."
Rus was essentially echoing Ian's advice. Jay thought to himself that naturally Rus would say that—he and Ian were both self-assured men who didn't let doubts or anxieties hold them back.
"The offer feels suspect somehow. Like I'm being given something too good for me, as bait. But I don't understand who would want to bait me, or what for."
"Maybe they want to get in good with that demanding boss of yours."
Jay agreed that would make sense. "But I don't see how pleasing me would win them anything with Ian."
"Maybe they see you as a potential new director and are trying to get in your good graces while you're still green."
Jay laughed. "Don't be ridiculous."
"There, there, don't be so humble. You're Mr. Big Shot now," Rus teased.
Jay sent him an exaggerated murderous look.
"What's the price anyway?" Rus asked.
When Jay told him, Rus was outraged. "That's ridiculously expensive! For a place that small, I could get three flats where I live. That's hardly a good offer. These rich people have warped your understanding and are trying to pull you away from your honest working-class roots."
Jay laughed at Rus's fiery tirade. "The neighborhood is truly posh, and property prices there are steep. But it's nice, with parks and near the river."
Rus grew serious. "You shouldn't overthink this. Sometimes a good deal is just a good deal. I'm sure rich people all get things through deals with each other, and you operate in their world now, so the least you can do is take some of that wealth for us honest folks."
"When I got this really good job, it was also too good to be true. Then I found out it was because of my looks."
Rus roared with laughter. "No wonder! Someone as pretty as you should breeze through life thanks to his face."
Jay's mood dampened, and he sighed in resignation. "That's not true. My looks have only ever brought me trouble."
"It shouldn't be that way. You should enjoy the benefits of being blessed with an appealing appearance. It should bring opportunities, not suffering. It's good to be careful, but you've moved from careful to paranoid. What does Luc say about the apartment?"
"It's way too modest for Luc. He'd never live in something so ordinary."
Rus grinned. "See? That's hardly as good as it seems, barely reaching your current standards."
Jay was still unconvinced, but maybe Rus was right. Maybe he was being too paranoid.
Before leaving, Rus reminded him of their plans. "Wear sportswear, and I'll see you there."
Jay returned home to finish chores and met Rus and his friends at five at the designated location. Rus had taken him to laser tag in an outdoor facility.
Jay spent two hours running around in mud in gloomy autumn drizzle, trying to shoot people with toy guns. It was an absolutely awful experience. When it was over, he was wet, cold, filthy and sore all over. His gym clothes looked ruined.
Everyone else seemed satisfied. Their team had even won despite Jay's abysmal performance, but that did not lift his spirits whatsoever.
He would never take Rus up again on any "fun activities." Between Luc's blind dates and Rus's outdoor exercises, he couldn't decide which was worse, and both had resulted in ruined clothes, though at least gym wear wasn't particularly precious.
He was half minded to call Ian again for rescue, but his filthy clothes would ruin Ian's car, the situation wasn't dire enough and he really didn't want to impose again. He was holding his phone when he got a text from Ian.
"Is the evening better this time?" 
Jay responded honestly: "No, equally miserable. I'm starting to suspect my friends secretly hate me."
Ian called immediately. "Do you need to be picked up?"
Jay laughed despite his poor mood. "No, I'm quite alright. I spent two hours trudging through mud and am filthy and exhausted, but I appreciate you worrying about me. This time the clothes go straight in the bin—no need to worry about emergency cleaning."
"That's good."
Ian wanted to say something more, but mostly was just happy to hear Jay's voice. Jay couldn't know that Ian had spent the whole day in a dejected mood, and really hadn't wanted to send that text, but also couldn't stand the silence of his apartment any longer.
"See you Monday," Jay finally said and hung up.
His mood lifted a bit after talking to Ian. Ian really was the best.
Scene 4
Indecision
Jay woke up aching the next morning. The laser tag adventure had left him sore in muscles he'd forgotten he had. It was Sunday, and to cheer himself up, he decided to do something completely different.
He went into the city for an elaborate breakfast at a fancy restaurant, treating himself to eggs Benedict and fresh pastries. Afterwards, he indulged in a massage at an upscale spa—a full package including hot stones and aromatherapy. He went shopping for new gym clothes to replace the ones ruined by mud, then enjoyed an equally elaborate lunch at a bistro he'd always wanted to try.
He returned home in the afternoon after having splurged uncharacteristically. The entire day had been about shaking things up and recharging, hoping to gain a new perspective on life.
Then he called his mother for advice, laying out his apartment situation much as he had with Rus.
"I'm so proud of how well you're doing. How far you've come from that scared young man who first moved to the city. In the real world, connections are everything. Your stepfather once got a fantastic deal on a car through a friend from work. The city has been good to you—you should follow your heart."
The conversation drifted to Christmas plans, with Jay once again avoiding commitments, just like last year.
"Work is busy, and the apartment hunt on top of it makes it hard to find time. I'll let you know."
"Your siblings will be very disappointed if you skip Christmas two years in a row."
Jay was properly apologetic, but he didn't have the mental capacity to think about holidays right now.
Seeking even more perspectives, Jay walked to Café Lemon, relieved to find Fay working behind the counter. Weekend shifts were always unpredictable.
"How are you feeling? I was sorry to hear you'd been ill."
"Much better, though this weather isn't helping anyone's health," Fay replied, gesturing toward the gloomy windows. "What can I get you?"
"A cappuccino, please. And actually, could I ask your advice about something?"
Jay outlined his apartment dilemma while Fay prepared his drink.
"I'd be sad to see you move from the area, but honestly? You should go for it. You sound like you really like the place, and if things turn sour, you can always sell it. It's not like it's a contract written in blood."
Jay sipped his cappuccino, watching the gloomy weather outside the windows. November had ended, and December should have brought holiday atmosphere. But he didn't feel it this year, and the world outside didn't look festive either. The gray, wet chill permeated everything, mirroring his mood. He had an opportunity to end the year with a major life decision, and it was making him feel scared and uncertain.
At least everyone seemed to be encouraging him to go for the apartment. Maybe they were right, and he was being silly.
In the late afternoon, he traveled to the pool facility he hadn't visited since his vacation, hoping that submerging in water would help him relax. It didn't. He returned home thoroughly spent from what had been a very productive day, but still cooked dinner for the whole week and ate at his small table, looking out the window.
It was quite possible these were his last few months in this apartment. He'd lived here for over six years already. It felt like home, perhaps more so than any other place he'd ever stayed. This apartment had witnessed so much of his struggle, his tears. It felt wrong to leave it behind.
On Monday, he arrived at work feeling melancholy and remained quiet the entire day. Ian noticed and felt guilty, imagining it was his meddling that had upset Jay. He wanted to comfort him somehow but didn't know how to approach it without revealing his involvement.
Jay stayed late to handle tasks that had accumulated over the weekend, and he worked closely with Ian, but barely spoke. Even their evening coffee involved only a perfunctory comment about the weather before Jay returned to his desk.
On Tuesday, Jay left at five, and once again he barely spoke with Ian or anyone else. The distance felt unbearable to Ian, who was missing even their mundane work-related conversations.
The gym session was hard, and Jay struggled to summon his normal energy.
"What's wrong? You look like someone stole your lunch money." Rus asked. 
Jay blamed Saturday evening, pouting. "I'm never going out with you again. That was the opposite of fun."
Rus was highly amused by Jay's complaints. "Alright, alright. Next time we'll figure out something that's fun for everyone. A blind date, maybe?"
Jay threw him a murderous look. "I changed my mind. I'm actually looking forward to my new trainer in the upscale, posh district gym."
Rus was at least relieved that if Jay was in the mood for teasing, it couldn't be anything too serious.
"I'm just torn about moving," Jay admitted. "I'm afraid of it. I like my apartment, it feels like home. I'm used to it, to the area, to the daily commute."
Rus patted him on the back. "You yourself complained that it's small and cramped and outdated. Can you imagine living that way forever, always having to make compromises? It's understandable to be afraid, but you shouldn't let nostalgia be your prison. No matter how much you like your current place, you'll like the new one even more."
The next day at work, Jay planned to leave at five for his scheduled vaccinations. His team members approved, most had already gotten theirs or were planning to soon. Only Kim was nonchalant about it.
"I never get sick," Kim declared.
Max rolled his eyes. "Wait until you reach my age."
Ela sighed heavily, looking at Kim with disapproval. Jay later heard her complaining to Amy about his childishness and wondered if they were heading into an awkward period of couple bickering. That was always uncomfortable to witness.
The vaccination was straightforward, so Jay arrived home at a reasonable hour and spent the entire evening browsing listings. He selected another set of apartments to tour, this time in the general area where the mysterious perfect apartment was located.
He called the agent the next day. "You can come see them this very afternoon," she said enthusiastically.
Jay left at five once again, to Ian's growing dismay. Ian felt like he barely got any time alone with Jay these days, and just seeing him during work hours was hardly enough. It only made him long for more.
Jay toured the area despite the awful weather. It was gloomy, wet, and gray, but the neighbourhood still looked nice. There were no run-down properties, everything was well maintained, and shops had holiday decorations up. He was impressed, though the places themselves were way above his budget, larger than he preferred, and all were very nice.
Jay asked numerous questions about the area, trying to get a feel for it, and the agent was accommodating. Jay had lied that his budget was five million, and maybe he even looked the part, because the agent never doubted his story. It was still hard to believe he was even in a position to consider such neighbourhoods.
On Friday, Jay again prepared to leave work at five. There really wasn't much to do, and he didn't feel like staying, his mood remaining low. As he packed his things, Ian came out of his office.
"Is everything alright? You seem under the weather these days."
"The apartment search is stressing me out. It's a big decision. Nothing you should worry about."
But Ian did worry. "Is there anything I can do?"
Jay shook his head and left, leaving Ian with his concern and guilt.
Ian really was such a kind and upstanding man, always ensuring team morale stayed high. Jay was sure Ian wouldn't fret over something so mundane, but he couldn't help himself. He spent the weekend touring the city, just looking at neighbourhoods, trying to sort his thoughts out.
Scene 5
Christmas trees
The annual Christmas tree decoration event was evident the moment Jay stepped into the office on Monday, which was filled with the scent of pine. The building lobby was already fully decorated, with a huge tree standing in the center. This year their workspace had two impressive, thick, fragrant evergreens.
Jay approached one of the trees, running his fingers along the branches, and soon Ian joined him.
"This year, in order to satisfy both camps, we're simply going to have two trees. The annual argument about decorating philosophy has become quite the tradition."
The eternal debate between Team Max, preferring gaudy chaos, and Team Amy, advocating for tasteful choices, was indeed legendary.
When decorating time arrived after lunch, excitement filled the air as colleagues joined their preferred aesthetic camps. Huge boxes of ornaments, garlands, and decorating supplies appeared as if by magic. Ela and Kim joined Team Max, while Zoe and Luc aligned themselves with Team Amy.
That left Ian and Jay to choose sides, ensuring the numbers remained even. Last year they had decorated together, and Jay was disappointed they were supposed to join different teams this year, though he tried not to show it.
"I'll go with Team Max," Jay announced, forcing brightness into his voice. "Less pressure to perform."
Ian nodded and moved toward Team Amy's tree. "That leaves me here, then."
Naturally, Max's tree became absolutely ridiculous, with every color imaginable and far too many garlands, while Team Amy, with Ian's contribution, produced a beautiful blue and gold composition. Each team looked pleased with their results, except Jay, who had enjoyed last year's collaborative effort much more.
Ian was frustrated as well, but he didn't show it at all, seeming perfectly content. But secretly, he was already plotting a solution to salvage what he most wanted from this tradition.
He had ordered another small tree to be placed in his office. He'd never had a tree in his office before, but he wanted to decorate with Jay. He remembered last year's joy, Jay's carefree smiles as they wrapped garland together. He'd looked forward to the event and hadn't expected his plan would backfire so spectacularly. He'd hoped fewer people per tree would make it more intimate, and not separate them.
Since it was Monday and there were always more tasks, Jay traditionally stayed late, tackling the weekend backlog of client correspondence. As everyone left, a man came maneuvering a smaller but beautifully shaped Christmas tree into Ian's office.
"I didn't expect you to want an additional tree," Jay commented, watching the setup process.
"I thought some festivity would be good for once," Ian replied, then asked nonchalantly, "Would you like to help decorate?"
Jay's mood lifted immediately. "I'll fetch the ornament boxes."
When Jay returned with supplies, Ian gestured toward the tree. "You can choose the color scheme."
"That's too much responsibility," Jay protested, slightly intimidated by the prospect of disappointing Ian with poor choices.
"What are your favorite colors?" Ian asked.
Jay was stumped. He'd never really thought about it. "I'm not sure I have definitive favorites."
"Then we'll each pick one color and try to create something cohesive from that."
Jay looked at the available ornaments, drawn to the gold options. They reminded him of Ian's hair in afternoon sunlight, though he would never voice such a thought. "Gold, I think."
"Silver," Ian replied, thinking of Jay's gray eyes catching light during their morning conversations.
They worked together, Jay following Ian's lead in spacing and proportion. The result was monochromatic but charming and quite elegant.
Jay then surprisingly proposed, "Should we add some red accents? To make it more festive?"
They hung a few more baubles, and the final effect was more sophisticated and warm. Jay stepped back to admire their collaboration.
"I'm not sure I'll bother with a personal tree at home this year," Jay said with a heavy sigh. "My apartment is cramped enough without adding an entire pine tree. It's a shame, last year's decorations will go unused."
"Are you still hesitating about the new apartment?"
Jay nodded. "That mysteriously perfect place has ideal space for a tree next to the desk in the living room. Would be exactly right for decorating."
"You certainly evaluated it thoroughly."
"Yeah, I took plenty of photos from every angle. I like it, I really do, but I'm scared of the commitment, of what it represents, of uprooting myself. And worse, of playing right into some scheme I don't understand."
Ian felt guilty. He was right that his meddling was causing Jay distress. He tried to untangle it somewhat, coming clean to a degree without revealing exactly how much he'd pressured the agent.
"I should clarify something. It's partially my fault that the agent was so enthusiastic. I asked him to prioritize finding you an exceptional deal, and he clearly took that request very seriously. You shouldn't feel burdened by his eagerness. That was never my intention. If you're uncomfortable, you should walk away. I can find another agent without briefing them about anything specific. Or you can continue searching independently. There's no deadline pressure, take whatever time you need until something feels exactly right."
Jay was relieved at least there was no elaborate conspiracy, just Ian's influence opening doors more widely than expected. But the underlying fear remained.
"While that's reassuring, it doesn't address my deeper anxiety about leaving the one place where I feel completely safe," Jay admitted.
Ian should have offered a reassuring speech, but instead diffused with humor. "I cannot relate to that sentiment at all. When the time came to leave my cramped studio behind, I had never felt more relieved. That place was essentially a prison cell that I frankly despised."
Jay laughed despite his mood. "I actually enjoy my studio. I specifically paid premium rent to live somewhere that felt cozy, even if objectively small."
"Different perspectives on confined spaces, clearly."
"I guess I'll postpone this choice until after Christmas. New Year seems like an appropriate moment for major life changes. For now, I need to decide whether I'm going home for the holidays. I skipped last year and my mother was quite displeased."
"I thought you had a good relationship with your family."
"During Christmas, my stepfather's parents always visit, and they're not particularly fond of me. They're not outright mean, but there's always tension. At best they treat me like I'm not there, at worst they actively try to chase me off. It's not that big a deal, they're strangers after all, and I have no relationship with them. But it still feels awkward."
"Then you definitely shouldn't go. Christmas is supposed to be pleasant. I'll invent some urgent project that requires your attention over the holidays."
"I'd appreciate that. Though I'm not sure I'm looking forward to another Christmas alone. What are your holiday plans? And if you say work, I'll be forced to take disciplinary action."
Ian replied deadpan, "Work."
Jay shot him a pointed look. "Do I need to once again insert myself into your schedule just to prevent you from spending Christmas reviewing spreadsheets?"
"I'd like that. I don't look forward to solitary holidays either. I typically work excessively during that period just to avoid thinking about... other things."
"Alright then. I'll come over and we'll prepare a proper Christmas feast together."
"That sounds like an excellent arrangement."
Suddenly, the gloomy December evening felt brighter. The small tree in Ian's office seemed to glow more warmly than any other, and Jay decided this might be his favorite Christmas decoration after all.
Chapter 30: Winter lights
Scene 1
Anticipation
December continued busily with finishing projects, preparing for annual reporting, and organizing for the holiday season when traditionally only a skeleton crew remained. The intense workload provided exactly the distraction Jay needed, forcing him to focus on immediate tasks instead of dwelling on major life decisions. He barely managed to squeeze in his Tuesday gym sessions.
Ian was naturally delighted to have Jay practically living in the office again. He savoured their extended time together, from early morning project reviews to late evening coffee conversations. The prospect of spending Christmas with Jay filled him with anticipation that not even the persistently wet, gloomy weather could dampen. The Christmas lights throughout the office seemed unusually beautiful this year, casting everything in a warm, festive glow.
Jay's mood had improved as well. The idea of moving was gradually becoming less terrifying as he grew accustomed to the possibility. At the very least, a new apartment would provide proper space for a Christmas tree.
Soon it was time for the annual Christmas party. The invitations had arrived much earlier, but they no longer required extensive preparations. Jay wore the midnight blue suit he'd bought for his first company function. It felt low-key now, even modest. He had to admit that properly tailored outfits felt completely different. There was nothing majorly wrong with it, but there was a feeling that it worked against him when he moved, notably absent with his tailored pieces. 
Jay smiled to himself with mild amazement. Was he seriously developing an appreciation for quality tailoring? It seemed an unexpected evolution in his personal standards.
The party maintained its traditional grandeur, held at an elegant old-world hotel with opulent decorations that created a properly festive atmosphere. Jay laughed with his team, engaging in conversations about food quality with Max and Luc.
"The catering was definitely superior last year," Jay insisted.
Max nodded. "Absolutely. This year's selection lacks the creative flair we've come to expect."
Luc remained diplomatic. "I honestly can't detect much difference between years. Good food is good food."
He chatted with Ian when Ian came to hang out with them, avoided Leo whenever he spotted him, and even spent time with the administrative department, with whom he maintained friendly relations. The atmosphere was relaxed, and so was Jay.
After dinner, Turner Senior delivered his traditional speech, followed by the distribution of holiday gifts. The customary basket contained high-end foods, imported sweets, and premium alcohol, but unlike the spa voucher from last year, this time it was a ten thousand voucher to a jewellery store.
"Almost enough for a nice watch," Luc commented, and Jay wasn't sure if it was appreciation or sarcasm.
"I'll get something lovely for the missus," Max declared. 
Ela and Amy immediately began animated discussions about gemstone preferences. Kim listened with attention, perhaps even discreetly taking notes on his phone, which prompted knowing grins between Jay and Luc.
Only Zoe seemed disappointed. "I would have preferred a voucher for a sports equipment store," she said mournfully.
Jay immediately decided to use his voucher for family gifts. He knew virtually nothing about jewellery, and the obscenely expensive watch he wore daily remained his most treasured possession. He didn't want another.
He used the weekend for gift shopping. He called his mother first, to officially confirm his absence from Christmas celebrations, apologizing for the decision while explaining the demands of his position.
"My boss traditionally works extended hours during this period, so naturally I'm expected to do the same," Jay explained, feeling only slightly guilty about the creative interpretation. "But I promise to visit in spring when things are less hectic, and I'm sending gifts for everyone to make it up to you."
His siblings had thoughtfully provided detailed wish lists, clearly comfortable with the idea that their successful brother should indulge them appropriately.
For Ema, he purchased cosmetics whose purposes remained mysterious despite the sales clerk's commentary. Jay listened politely but registered none of the technical information about application techniques or seasonal colour preferences.
Ari had requested three specific building block sets, all space-themed. Jay decided to purchase all three, since they cost less combined than Ema's cosmetic collection.
Tim's camping supply requests were the most challenging, requiring visits to several specialty stores before Jay found equipment that matched the specifications.
He added a bottle of premium whiskey for his stepfather and an elegant perfume for his mother. While at the fragrance counter, he also inquired about the men's cologne selection. The helpful saleswoman presented him with many samples. Some were overpowering, others too old-fashioned, but he eventually chose something light and herbal for himself. It was expensive, so he hoped he hadn't blundered by choosing something embarrassingly unsophisticated. He'd wanted to buy cologne for a long time but never had the opportunity, and now seemed as good a moment as ever.
At the jewellery store, Jay requested five pieces for his family members, providing basic descriptions but leaving specific selections to the clerk's judgement. The voucher covered everything, resulting in a watch for his stepfather, chains with emblems for his brothers, and earrings and necklaces for his mother and sister. Jay suspected his brothers might not appreciate jewellery, but wanted to divide the voucher equitably. At minimum, they would have meaningful mementos. Everything got beautifully packaged and shipped to his family immediately.
This left him with the most difficult purchase: a gift for Ian. What did you buy for your wealthy boss whom you respected and admired, but who already possessed everything? It had to be personal and thoughtful.
He discovered a store selling ridiculously expensive but beautiful lighters. He wasn't particularly fond of Ian's occasional smoking, but sometimes situations seemed to call for it. Jay selected the most refined option available, barely flinching at the cost, and arranged for custom engraving: "You've got this." 
The message was intended to encourage Ian when things became difficult. It felt slightly cheesy but sufficiently personal. He hoped he wasn't overstepping.
He also purchased a box of exquisite crystal tree ornaments to bring to Ian's apartment, along with ingredients for baking a Christmas cake. His apartment lacked an oven and his baking experience was minimal, but he wanted to have homemade pastries to create a properly festive celebration.
Spending so much money no longer bothered him—it was a special occasion that warranted celebration, and he could afford it comfortably. Christmas was approaching, and he would spend it with the one person whose company he valued most. It was going to be magical.
Scene 2
Christmas Day
With Christmas approaching fast, everyone at work was busy tying up loose ends. On the last day before the holidays, customary wishes and farewells were exchanged. Jay received enthusiastic embraces from both Max and Amy, who made their annual rounds hugging everyone. Luc delivered a teary-eyed speech about his first Christmas alone in years, though Jay suspected he'd actually found company judging from his smug smile.
Ian also made his rounds, offering holiday wishes to everyone. He approached Jay at the end, and Jay said conspiratorially, "We can save the wishes for tomorrow. Do you have a tree?"
When Ian shook his head, Jay declared, "You have to arrange one. We can decorate it tomorrow."
They parted ways in excellent moods, exchanging secretive smiles.
The next morning, Jay woke early and took an unreasonably long shower. He called his mother while eating breakfast, receiving profuse thanks for the gifts. 
"The jewellery is absolutely beautiful. Ema is practically squealing about hers. And the boys are already building with those space sets. Just promise me you'll take care of yourself. Don't work too hard over the holidays."
"I promise."
Then came the challenge of preparing for the day ahead. Choosing his outfit was more difficult than expected. He wanted to look nice but not overly formal. Three-piece suits seemed like overkill, especially since he'd be cooking. But sweatpants were absolutely out of the question, and his standard office attire felt boring for such a special occasion. He finally decided on the extravagant designer outfit that had cost him a fortune, way too silky and form-fitting for his conservative sensibilities, but it surely wouldn't be a problem around Ian. If it got ruined while cooking, well, that was a risk he was willing to take.
A single spray of his new cologne finished the preparations. He examined himself in the mirror from every angle. He had to admit he looked good.
He packed everything needed and took a taxi to Ian's right after breakfast. His heart was beating far too rapidly for what was ostensibly just a friendly Christmas dinner. It was barely past ten when he arrived. He wasn't sure if he was too early, but rang anyway, and Ian answered immediately.
"Come up."
Ian opened the door wearing a cream cashmere sweater and dark slacks—probably the first time Jay had seen him in anything resembling casual wear. Still elegant but more approachable, and he looked absolutely stunning. 
Jay had to pause, then dropped his eyes and blushed when he realized he was staring. Ian had a similar reaction to Jay's appearance, since his outfit highlighted every line of his body, but managed to conceal his response more successfully.
"Merry Christmas," they said simultaneously, then laughed at their synchronicity.
Jay unpacked ingredients in the kitchen, taking in the scene Ian had prepared. A gorgeous evergreen stood ready for decoration, boxes of ornaments waited nearby, and Christmas jazz played in the background.
"I managed to find a tree yesterday evening. And I have some ornaments, though not many."
"I brought additional ones," Jay said, taking out his box.
They began with the tree, working in intimate proximity as they wound white garlands through the branches, occasionally exchanging loaded glances. Ian caught Jay's new scent and couldn't help commenting.
"That cologne suits you perfectly."
Jay grew shy. "I hope it's not too strong."
"Not at all. It's lovely."
Their tree turned into an enchanting composition, and both smiled as they stepped back.
Next they moved to the kitchen, and soon the air filled with scents of cinnamon and cloves as Jay prepared a traditional cake while Ian started the Christmas dinner preparations. Ian produced matching aprons, which sent Jay into delighted laughter.
"Seriously? These are adorable."
"I wanted this to feel domestic."
"I haven't baked anything since I was a child. My grandmother used to let me help with Christmas cookies," Jay admitted as he was folding flour.
"I've never baked at all. This is entirely uncharted territory."
They moved around each other with surprising coordination. While the cake baked, Jay chopped vegetables to assist Ian, who handled the more complex frying and stuffing. Jay stole glances at Ian as he moved between the stove and counter, sleeves rolled up, completely focused on the task at hand.
"I keep marvelling at your skill. I can feed myself adequately, but you're in a completely different league. Is there anything you're not good at?" Jay asked.
"Plenty of things. But cooking isn't one of them. During those long solitary evenings in my studio, on nights when I was already sick of working, I had nothing else to do but practice."
They finished preparations, setting the table with food far too abundant for two people, but both wanted to make the occasion special. Ian lit candles and opened good wine, making the atmosphere properly festive.
They sat, ate, and exchanged stories about their cooking attempts and food preferences. Jay's cake turned out acceptable—a tiny bit dry, but he was pleased his first serious baking attempt wasn't a disaster. 
"Not bad for someone without an oven," Ian declared, examining their creation.
"It's edible, which exceeds my expectations."
Ian's cooking was, naturally, delicious.
When they were comfortably full, they moved to the couch for gift exchange. Jay felt suddenly unsure about his choice.
Ian unwrapped the package, looking surprised. "A lighter?"
Jay fumbled for words. "I know you don't smoke regularly, and frankly I'm not fond of the habit, but it seems during stressful situations it can't be helped. So at the very least, I wanted you to have a reminder that you've been through worse and always emerged successful."
"How do you even know I smoke?"
"Why wouldn't I know? I can smell the lingering scent on you during particularly difficult negotiations."
Ian felt deeply touched, not just by the gesture but by Jay's attentiveness. "I promise to use it as infrequently as possible."
"I'm happy to hear that."
Ian's gift came in an elegant jewelry box—cufflinks with small sapphires and a matching tie pin, beautiful and clearly expensive.
Jay was speechless for a moment, his eyes growing glossy. "It's beautiful. I... I've never owned anything like this."
"It will look perfect on you," Ian reassured him. "You'll need a dedicated shirt for the cufflinks, but they should complement your navy three-piece brilliantly for formal occasions. Probably your tuxedo for the upcoming gala as well."
Jay groaned at the mention of the gala. "Don't remind me of that disaster."
"If anyone bothers you at all, find me immediately. Or punch them directly—I'll take responsibility."
Jay laughed, delighted by Ian's sudden militant attitude. "I definitely won't be punching anyone. If I were the punching type, I'd probably have much less trouble in life."
"Perhaps. But the option remains available."
"Let's watch something," Jay said, and they selected a heartwarming Christmas film.
They lounged on the couch with wine and leftover treats. As the afternoon progressed and Jay drank more, he grew increasingly talkative, grumbling about his family in an exaggerated way.
"My siblings are absolutely shameless. I spent years babysitting those ungrateful brats when I was a teenager, and now they coerce expensive gifts out of me."
He caught himself mid-rant. "Though I have no right to complain, given how awful your family was to you. Speaking of which, your father sounds like an absolute—"
"Jay," Ian interrupted gently, but he was clearly amused by the sudden outburst.
"Right, sorry. I get whiny when I drink."
Ian monitored Jay's alcohol consumption, ensuring he didn't go overboard and stayed pleasantly relaxed. They spent the evening talking about nothing in particular, surrounded by their feast and watching sentimental movies. It was perfect. Both looked at each other with barely concealed adoration, exchanging light banter. Finally, as the hour grew late. Jay insisted on helping clean up, but Ian waved him off.
"Leave it. It can wait until tomorrow."
Jay called a taxi, and when Ian offered to escort him home, Jay laughed. "I'm nowhere near that intoxicated. Besides, it's Christmas—you should be relaxing."
At the door, Jay turned back. "I had the most wonderful time. Thank you for everything."
"Thank you for coming," Ian replied quietly.
They stood at the door for a moment, neither quite ready to end the day.
After Jay finally left, Ian stood alone in his apartment, still wrapped in the warm afterglow of Jay's company. He normally reserved smoking for dire situations, but today was special. He stepped outside for a cigarette, using Jay's lighter and reading the engraved message. 
"You've got this."
He smiled to himself. Did he really? At least his lovely assistant seemed to have complete faith in his capabilities.
Jay had looked radiant that day—carefree and happy—and Ian treasured every moment. But Jay had also looked more attractive than ever, and there had been moments when it was difficult to stop himself from reaching out to touch him. He never would, but the urge had been overwhelming.
He wanted Jay to only ever look at him with those trusting, adoring eyes. He remembered that morning weeks ago when Jay had woken hungover and frightened, backing against the wall in confusion. Ian never wanted to see fear in Jay's eyes again—especially not when Jay looked at him.
Scene 3
After Christmas
Jay spent the rest of Christmas resting, occasionally replaying moments from the day in his mind. The memory of Ian's apartment, the tree they had decorated together, their conversations, all felt precious and worth preserving. But soon enough, the holiday ended and it was time to return to work.
The office would be mostly empty during the holiday period, which meant long days with Ian in the warmly illuminated space. Jay remembered last year's Christmas period with fondness. The shared meals, the late hours that never felt burdensome. He was looking forward to it again.
Jay reached the office early, finding the reception area dark. He made coffee in the empty kitchen and sat at his desk, watching the city wake through the windows.
Ian arrived twenty minutes later. "You're early."
"I couldn't sleep. Too much excitement about spreadsheets."
"Naturally. Nothing says post-Christmas enthusiasm like financial reports."
Ian disappeared into his office. Through the open door, Jay heard him arranging papers. The sounds of their shared workspace surrounded him like a comfortable blanket.
Luc arrived at nine, dramatically throwing himself across Jay's desk. "I'm dying. Why do we have to work between Christmas and New Year?"
"We're an abnormal company run by sadists," Jay responded solemnly.
Luc collapsed dramatically into his chair. "Jay, you look suspiciously cheerful. It's unnatural."
"I like the quiet period. Nobody calling, no urgent meetings. Just us and the numbers."
"You're broken. Fundamentally broken as a person."
Zoe arrived next, more composed but equally unenthusiastic. "I forgot how empty the building gets. The security guard looked surprised to see me."
"At least nobody got sick this year. Remember last year when Ela had the flu? We were down to three people," Jay said.
"Small mercies," Luc muttered.
They got to work, but the atmosphere was relaxed. With most clients on holiday and no pressing deadlines, they could take their time. By noon, Jay's stomach was growling.
"Should we order something?" Luc asked.
"Yeah, we could eat here, like last year. Save time, stay focused."
"Agreed. I'm not putting on a coat to freeze outside when there's a perfectly good kitchen right here."
When the food arrived, they migrated to the kitchen area, a space that was Ian's private domain during lunch hours while the rest of the team went to restaurants. Ian was already there, preparing his standard balanced meal.
They ate together at the large kitchen table, Luc starting an animated discussion about New Year's resolutions, declaring he would learn the saxophone, to everyone's horror.
"Your neighbours will murder you," Zoe said.
"They already hate me. Might as well give them a real reason."
"What about you, Jay? Any resolutions?" Zoe asked.
"Find a proper apartment, maybe."
"I thought that agent found you something perfect. Just take it. The location is great, the price is reasonable, and you need the space."
"But it's so small. You'll be able to afford something three times that size soon," Luc protested.
"I don't need three times the size."
"You don't know what you need until you have it. Trust me, once you experience proper standards, you can't go back."
Zoe rolled her eyes. "Not everyone needs a penthouse, Luc."
"But everyone deserves one."
"It's the perfect size for one person. Clever storage, good layout. I don't need massive amounts of space," Jay argued.
"You will when you get promoted. Which is inevitable. Then you'll want a proper place for entertaining, maybe a home office," Luc countered.
"I'm not getting promoted. I'm an assistant."
"For now."
Ian had been silent during this exchange, but Jay noticed his expression growing increasingly tense.
After lunch, they returned to work. The afternoon stretched long but productive. At five o'clock, Zoe saved her files and got up.
"I'm heading out. See you tomorrow."
"Same. Don't work too late, you two," Luc said, already packing his bag. 
Jay waved them off, and suddenly the office was much quieter. He glanced toward Ian's office and returned to his own tasks. An hour later, Ian appeared at his desk.
"Caffeine break?"
"Definitely."
They reconvened in the kitchen and talked for an hour, maybe more, about music, hobbies, cultural differences between regions. Sports they'd played as children.
"I have a fashion question," Jay said eventually.
"Go ahead."
"How do you always look so put together? I'm trying, but I still feel like I'm playing dress-up half the time."
"My tailor does all the work. I just listen to him. I very rarely wear anything other than a suit, so it's not difficult."
"You make it sound simple."
"It is simple. Find someone competent, trust their judgement, and don't overthink it."
"Do you ever wear jeans?"
"I own one pair. They're ten years old and I've worn them twice."
"Now I'm trying to picture you in jeans and my brain is refusing to cooperate."
They returned to work and the evening wore on. Eventually, Jay checked his watch and was startled to find it was nearly nine.
"We should probably call it a day," he said reluctantly.
"Probably."
But neither of them moved immediately. The office was conducive to the same intimacy Jay remembered from last year, that sense of existing in a bubble separate from the rest of the world. He no longer had any reservations when talking to Ian. The glass wall that had felt so solid just months ago seemed to have dissolved entirely.
The next day, Jay decided to enhance their lunch situation. He stopped at the bakery he'd discovered last year. He purchased an assortment of salads, sandwiches, and pastries, charging everything to the company card.
When he unpacked the bags onto the kitchen counter, Luc's eyes widened. "Did you rob a restaurant?"
"Christmas work requires morale boosters. Consider it compensation for skeleton crew duty."
"I'm not arguing. This looks amazing."
They ate well that day and every day after. Jay made the bakery run part of his mornings, ensuring they had variety and quality. The four of them gathered in the kitchen for lunch like clockwork. Even Ian supplemented his meal with the red cabbage salad, which came with pomegranate seeds and roasted vegetables.
The following days followed the same pattern. Work in the morning, lunch in the kitchen, more work in the afternoon, then long evening hours alone with Ian. Luc and Zoe always left at five, claiming they had lives outside the office, though Luc admitted his life currently consisted of watching cooking shows and annoying his flatmates. The building felt vast and empty, but the Christmas lights turned the space into something intimate.
Jay and Ian would drift to the lounge area around six, ostensibly taking a break but really just wanting each other's company. Jay would sprawl on the couch while Ian leaned against the wall, pastry in hand, looking more relaxed than he ever did during regular hours. The office trees twinkled around them, and the city lights glowed through the windows.
"Your diet is suffering," Jay observed.
"It's the holiday season. I'm not an ascetic monk."
"Could've fooled me. You're very disciplined."
"There are exceptions."
Jay sighed deeply. "I'm still thinking about the apartment. Zoe thinks I should go for it. The offer is great, it fits my needs, why hesitate? But Luc is against it. He says the flat is too small and not glamorous enough. Plus, given my career trajectory, I'll soon be able to afford something much more ambitious."
"Luc has expensive taste."
"He does. But he's not wrong, is he?"
"Luc is projecting his own preferences onto you. The question is whether the apartment suits your life, not whether it impresses other people."
"You're right. I think I'm just scared of making the wrong choice."
"There's no wrong choice. You can always move again if circumstances change."
Jay felt some of the tension ease, even if he still wasn't entirely convinced. "That's true. Thanks."
On New Year's Eve, they worked until three o'clock. The office felt peaceful, as though the city itself was holding its breath before the celebration began. Ian emerged from his office and surveyed the nearly empty floor.
"I'm officially declaring the workday complete. Everyone to my office, please."
They gathered in his space, where Ian produced a bottle of excellent whiskey and four glasses.
"This is new," Zoe said.
"It's not new," Luc corrected. "He did this last year with just Jay and me."
"It wasn't a custom before that. Is this going to be a tradition now?"
"Perhaps," Ian said, pouring. "It seems appropriate."
He handed glasses around, and they stood in a small circle. The late afternoon light slanted through the windows, turning everything golden.
"To a successful year," Ian said, raising his glass. "And to the year ahead. May it bring continued growth and prosperity for Turner & Associates, and for all of you personally."
They drank. Jay immediately winced, the whiskey burning his throat.
"Still can't handle it?" Luc laughed.
"It tastes like liquid fire."
Jay remembered this moment from last year—how formal it had felt, how he'd been uncertain about everything. This year he felt only gratitude. Ian shook hands with each of them in turn, a firm grip and direct eye contact. When he reached Jay, the handshake lasted longer than the others.
"Thank you for everything this year. You've made it far better than it would have been otherwise."
Jay felt his throat tighten slightly. "Thank you for the same."
After the others left, Jay watched Ian return to his desk.
"You're staying?"
"Just one more hour."
Jay wanted to protest, to drag Ian away from his computer and force him to celebrate, but he knew better. Instead, he said, "Happy New Year, Ian. Have a good evening. Don't work too late."
Jay returned home to his apartment, made himself dinner, and tried to focus on his textbooks. But he couldn't concentrate, his mind drifting back to the office, to Ian alone at his desk while the rest of the city celebrated.
At midnight, he set down the book and went to his window. The city erupted in light and sound, fireworks blooming against the dark sky. He pulled out his phone and typed out a message.
"Happy New Year. Thank you for making this year extraordinary. Here's to whatever comes next."
He sent it before he could overthink it, and barely a minute passed before his phone chimed.
"Happy New Year, Jay. I'm looking forward to the year ahead."
He smiled to himself, watching the fireworks continue. The new year was starting perfectly. Now he just had to survive the quarterly reports and the gala.
Scene 4
The annual storm
The entire team returned to the office after New Year, and the grumbling started immediately.
"I can't believe we're doing this again. Other companies ease back into work. We dive straight into hell," Ela said, dropping into her chair with theatrical despair.
"Annual reporting waits for no one," Amy replied, though she looked equally resigned.
Jay barely heard them. Ian's inbox had exploded overnight—clients suddenly remembering urgent matters, international markets reopening, everything demanding immediate attention. He catalogued messages, prioritizing by urgency, when Ian's annual email popped up.
Jay skimmed it—congratulations on exceptional performance, record-breaking returns, gratitude for dedication. His eyes caught on "bonus distributions" but he filed it away to read properly later. Right now, eleven urgent emails needed forwarding.
Soon after, his phone buzzed with a bank notification. Jay glanced at it absently, then froze. The number looked wrong.
He checked again. The deposit was real, sitting in his account. Last year's bonus had seemed generous for his few months of work. This was... this was more than double his entire previous year's income.
He stared at the screen, trying to process what this meant for his life, but Luc appeared at his desk with an urgent question and the moment was lost. The whirlwind of duties swallowed him once again.
Despite all their preparations, things went wrong. Deadlines were ruthless. Each day became a battle against time itself. Those slow, intimate hours with Ian disappeared completely.
By the fourth day, formal dress codes collapsed. Kim showed up in sweatpants. Amy wore the same oversized sweater three days running. Someone brought in sleeping bags. Zoe worked from a nest of blankets in the corner of the conference room. Even Ela abandoned her blazers for comfortable cardigans. Only Ian maintained his suits, though Jay noticed the ties disappearing by evening.
"I hate January. I hate reporting. I hate numbers," Luc groaned, sprawled across his desk.
Sunday night, deep into the second week, the office resembled a refugee camp. Ela sat in the corner, actually crying over spreadsheets that refused to reconcile despite hours of searching. Max had given up all pretense and was lying on the lounge sofa, staring at the ceiling.
Jay glanced at the clock. Nearly eleven. His eyes burned from staring at spreadsheets and his back ached from sitting too long in the same position.
He got up, stretched, then made his way to the kitchen. Through the glass, Jay could see Ian hunched over his desk, face taut, eyes red from strain.
Jay made coffee. He rarely prepared beverages for Ian, but Ian looked like he needed it. He brought the mug to Ian's office and entered without knocking.
Ian looked up, startled.
"Caffeine. You look like you're about to die at your desk," Jay said, setting it down.
"Thank you." Ian's voice was rough. He wrapped his hands around the mug but didn't drink. 
"I'm breaking my team. Look at them. Ela is crying. Max has achieved horizontal surrender. Hardly a glowing testimonial for my leadership."
"You're not breaking anyone. We're stressed, but we're managing. We'll get through this."
"I know. I just wish it didn't require destroying everyone in the process."
Jay was quiet for a moment, then said, "We should do something fun once this is over. Like we did back in autumn."
Ian visibly perked up at that. "Really?"
"Though this time you should think of things you actually like. I picked last time."
Ian pulled up his calendar, scrolling through the maze of appointments. "The weekend after the gala. That's the only opening in January."
"Then it's a promise."
"I'll hold you to it."
They returned to work feeling slightly more hopeful about the future.
When the reporting period finally released its death grip, everyone stumbled out of the office like survivors of a natural disaster. Jay hadn't been to the gym once since New Year's. His eating schedule was destroyed. His sleep pattern was nonexistent.
But each time his spirits faltered, he looked at his bank balance. The number still seemed unreal. He was loaded. That was such a weird feeling.
Then he looked at his calendar, where the night out with Ian was circled in red. Life wasn't so bad after all.
The gala loomed. Jay made appointments to get his hair done and purchase a proper shirt for his cufflinks. The preparations were less fraught with anxiety than last year. He knew what to expect now.
The night arrived too quickly. Jay adjusted his bow tie for the fifth time, watching himself in the mirror. Same tuxedo as last year, but the new shirt, the sapphire cufflinks, his watch—he looked the part even if he didn't feel it.
Nervousness crept through him as he remembered last year's incident. He made a mental list of rules: don't drink, avoid crowds, hide behind more senior team members whenever possible.
The venue was a ballroom in the most upscale district of the city. Photographers clustered at the entrance where limousines deposited distinguished guests onto red carpet. Jay's taxi dropped him a street away. He slipped past the cameras, attaching himself to a group from accounting.
Once inside, he immediately located what he imagined was a hidden corner and stationed himself there with a glass of sparkling water. It took less than five minutes for Ian to find him.
"Jay. Are you alright?" Ian looked worse than Jay had ever seen him, despite his immaculate attire. His face was drawn, eyes shadowed.
"I'm fine. Just trying to stay out of the way."
"That's probably wise. I wanted to check on you, but I can't stay long. I have to circulate." Ian glanced around the room, and Jay noticed something odd in his expression. Not just stress—something closer to fear.
"I understand. I'll be fine."
"Find me if you need anything. Anything at all."
"I will."
Ian disappeared into the crowd, and Jay watched him go with concern. Something was definitely wrong.
Jay drifted between Max, Amy, and Luc as the evening progressed, trying never to be alone. He held the same glass of sparkling water for over an hour, tense as if he were on a battlefield. Across the room, Ian played his role perfectly, but Jay could see the strain. Something had rattled him badly. 
Max told lengthy stories about his children. Luc flirted outrageously with someone from legal. Jay smiled and nodded and watched the clock. The conversations around him blurred into background noise.
Ian, meanwhile, was drowning in dread. He had woken that morning from a nightmare so realistic he'd believed it was real for several terrifying moments. The very same gala, marble floors and distinguished crowds, and at eleven o'clock a man had approached with a knife. Ian had been the target, but Jay had thrown himself in the way. Ian had watched Jay bleed out on the floor in his arms, unable to stop it, unable to do anything but hold him.
He'd woken drenched in cold sweat at four in the morning and hadn't been able to shake the images since.
And to make matters worse, a client situation had emerged that morning. An urgent meeting scheduled for next week, impossible to delegate or reschedule. He'd have to cancel his plans with Jay. After everything they'd been through these past weeks, after finally having something to look forward to, it was being taken away.
He was unsettled, annoyed, disappointed, and couldn't hide it no matter how hard he tried.
At ten forty-five, Ian found Jay on the balcony, standing alone and looking out over the city.
"Do you want to leave?" Ian asked.
Jay turned, surprised. "I'm fine. Are you alright?"
"No. I need to get out of here. I could use a pretext to exit."
Something in Ian's tone made Jay agree immediately. "Of course."
They slipped out through a back entrance where Ian's driver waited. Once in the car, Jay tried to understand what was happening.
"What's wrong? Did something happen?"
Ian was silent for a long moment, watching the city pass outside the window. He couldn't tell Jay about the nightmare. "Client emergency. I have to fly out Thursday evening. Our plans for the weekend—I have to cancel."
Jay's face fell. "Oh."
"After everything we just went through. After working ourselves half to death for two weeks straight. More work ahead. It's never enough."
"It's alright. We can reschedule."
"It's not alright. Nothing about this is alright."
Jay didn't know what to say to that. Ian was right—it wasn't fair. But fairness rarely factored into their work.
When they arrived at Jay's building, Jay said impulsively, "Want to come up? It's probably the last time I'll host you in the old apartment."
Ian looked at him, something complicated passing across his face, then nodded.
Jay's studio was exactly as Ian remembered—small, cramped, but meticulously organized. Jay retrieved the bottle of hard liquor from the Christmas basket and poured generous measures into two mismatched glasses.
Ian examined the label. "It's acceptable."
They sat on Jay's narrow couch and drank. Jay grimaced at his first sip while Ian drank his like water, consuming most of the bottle, needing the burn to push away the nightmare images. Their conversation consisted mainly of grumbling about the unfairness of the world, the relentlessness of their work, the impossibility of ever having time for themselves.
"I thought once I achieved success, things would get easier. What a stupid assumption that was," Ian said.
"Success just means different problems."
"Bigger problems. More expensive problems."
"Problems that bleed into every hour of every day."
"Exactly."
Ian felt the alcohol softening his anxiety, though he couldn't stop glancing at his watch. Midnight. In his dream, Jay had been dead for an hour now. But Jay was here, alive, slightly flushed from whiskey. Safe.
Eventually the bottle was empty and the hour was late. Ian stood unsteadily, and Jay helped him to the door.
"Thank you for tonight. I needed this," Ian said.
"Anytime."
Ian looked at Jay one last time in the dim light of the hallway. The words slipped out before he could stop them. 
"You looked beautiful tonight."
He caught himself immediately, clenching his jaw. That was too much, too revealing. He'd made it weird. 
"I should go."
He left quickly, not waiting for a response, and spent the ride home chastising himself for his stupidity.
Jay stood alone in his doorway, blushing furiously. His heart beat rapidly in his chest, his mind replaying those words over and over.
He tried to be rational about it. Ian was exhausted, stressed, drunk. The words meant nothing.
But he went to bed still thinking about it, unable to make sense of his own reaction, unwilling to examine why the compliment had affected him so deeply.
Scene 5
Moving forward
After the gala, the atmosphere at work was too depleted for proper gossip. Everyone moved slowly and spoke quietly, and conversations were minimal and mostly work-related.
"This year is much worse than last. Or am I imagining things?" Amy said during one brief break.
"You're not imagining anything. January last year was brutal, but at least we had some energy left. This year we're starting from empty," Max confirmed. 
Even the gossip about Ian's early departure was less animated, despite this happening the second year in a row. A few people mentioned it in passing, speculating that he'd developed a particular distaste for these events, or perhaps the exhaustion had finally caught up with him.
Ela asked Jay about it directly. "You left early too, right? What happened?"
"I left before midnight. Nothing dramatic," Jay said, which was technically true. 
"Ian looked terrible all evening. Was he sick?"
"Just tired, I think. Like all of us."
No one on the team had energy left to spare for investigation. The topic died quickly, replaced by more immediate concerns about deadlines and deliverables.
With the beginning of the year historically being the busiest period, moods were generally poor. Jay didn't see any enthusiasm about the annual bonuses, which was proof enough of how stretched thin everyone was. People mentioned the amounts with wan gratitude but no real excitement.
"It's generous. I'm overjoyed. But mostly I just want to sleep for three days straight," Luc said flatly.
"Same," Kim agreed.
Jay decided to start getting his affairs in order despite the exhaustion. He returned to the gym on Tuesday evening, and Rus pretended not to recognize him.
"Excuse me, sir, but I think you have the wrong building. The corporate offices are down the street."
Jay smiled wearily. "Very funny."
"I was starting to think you'd died. Or moved to another country."
"Work has been insane."
"So I gathered. You look exhausted."
"I am exhausted. And I have news. I decided to buy the apartment after all. I'll probably move within a couple of months."
Rus's face fell. "Really? That's... well, that's great for you. But I'm going to miss having you around."
"We can still hang out. It's not like I'm leaving the city."
"Promise?"
"Promise. You're not getting rid of me that easily."
They worked out together, and Rus kept the conversation light, avoiding anything that required serious thought. Jay appreciated it.
Afterwards, Jay went to Café Lemon to deliver the same news to Fay. Her face lit up when he entered.
"Look who finally remembered we exist!"
"I've been buried in work. I wanted to tell you that I'm taking your advice. I'm buying the apartment."
Fay's expression turned triumphant. "I knew you would! That's wonderful news."
"It won't happen for a few months, but I wanted you to know since you encouraged me to go for it."
"You'll still visit though, right? Even when you're living in the posh district?"
"Of course. There's no café as nice as this one, even in the posh district."
"Damn right there isn't. I'm proud of you, you know. You've come a long way."
The next day at work, Jay called the agent during a brief lull. "I'd like to schedule another viewing. I'm pretty much decided, but I want to see it one more time."
The agent was overjoyed. "That's excellent news! When would work for you?"
"I'm very busy at the moment, but sometime in the next two weeks?"
"Absolutely. I'll be in touch to confirm a time."
Jay hung up feeling both excited and terrified. This was really happening.
The remainder of the week passed quickly. The long hours were too strained to properly appreciate. Ian was tense, and Jay was equally unhappy. Their planned day out was supposed to happen this weekend, but instead Ian left early Thursday to catch a flight for the client meeting, looking miserable about it.
Friday marked the first day Jay had ever worked without Ian in the office beside him. It felt oddly forlorn. Ian's dark office looked ominous through the glass wall. The Christmas trees were already gone, and the heavy gray skies visible through the windows made Jay feel like he was attending a wake.
He tried to shake the solemn mood and sent Ian a text. "Office is weird without you. Kim is being productive. Deeply unnatural."
Ian was already in the meeting when his phone buzzed. He glanced at it discreetly and felt his mood lift. Not much, but enough to make the presentations slightly more bearable.
This wasn't how he'd wanted to spend the weekend. He'd half-wanted taking Jay with him, he was his assistant, after all, but decided against it. He remembered how heavily Jay had handled the jet lag last time, and Jay was already exhausted. Ian didn't want to make things worse. At least Jay would get some rest, even if Ian himself couldn't.
Jay spent the weekend on the gym, rest, and cleaning. He purchased moving boxes and began cataloguing his belongings. The process was simultaneously exciting and depressing. Books, clothes, kitchen supplies, everything went into lists and categories.
He'd already called the agent with the good news. Now he just needed to contact the bank. Ian had made arrangements for him to meet with a clerk at a bank Jay had never used and never even heard of, but since Ian recommended it, surely there was nothing to fear.
The next week, Ian returned but remained in a foul mood. It was the last week of January, and they were slowly beginning preparations for the busiest time of the year. The beginning of the year always consisted of refreshing the strategy, which was a major production.
Last year Jay only knew the period was busy. Now he had a clearer understanding of what was happening, exactly, and he didn't look forward to it. Neither did anyone else.
"Here we go again. Strategy refresh. My favourite time of year," Luc said mournfully during lunch.
"At least we know what to expect," Max offered.
"That makes it worse."
"Much worse. Strategy requires actual thinking."
"And endless meetings. So many meetings," Amy added.
"And revisions. Draft after draft after draft" Max said. 
The mere word "strategy" sounded like a curse to everyone.
The long hours continued, draining and full of arduous assignments. But Jay still found an afternoon off to meet with the bank representative. Ian had arranged the appointment, providing contact information and a brief introduction.
The bank was in a part of the city Jay rarely visited. The representative greeted him and led him to a private office.
The mortgage terms were surreal. Two percent interest over thirty years. No penalties for early repayment. Flexible terms if his circumstances changed. Jay had researched enough to know this was impossibly favourable.
"This is... very generous," Jay said cautiously.
"Mr. Hagen vouched for you personally. That carries weight with our institution."
There it was again. Ian's name opening doors, smoothing paths. Jay wasn't sure how he felt about it anymore. He was uncomfortably aware of how much influence Ian wielded on his behalf. It felt like being cared for. Protected.
"I'll need some time to review the paperwork."
"Of course. Take all the time you need. When you're ready to proceed, just contact me directly."
Jay returned home with the preliminary paperwork, reading through every page twice. The terms were exactly as described, almost too good to be true. But he was becoming more comfortable with the fact that Ian's name apparently held more weight than Jay had imagined.
He ended the month with a heavy heart. Everything—well, almost everything—was going as planned. But such major decisions still made him anxious. He probably wouldn't move until at least April, maybe May, even if everything went well. He simply had no bandwidth left for the arrangements.
For now, January was ending, and the continued demands of the first quarter lay ahead. Strategy season loomed like a dark cloud on the horizon. He'd have to grit his teeth and endure.
At least he had the memories. The ferry ride and autumn gardens. Christmas in Ian's apartment, decorating the tree together, Ian in that cream sweater looking softer than Jay had imagined possible. The late evenings in the office kitchen, Ian leaning against the wall, talking about nothing and everything.
He clung to those moments as February approached, promising himself that eventually, things would ease. He just had to survive until then.
Choice
Chapter 31: Things that slip through fingers
Scene 1
Flood
February was unusually wet. There had been practically no snow this winter, just gloom and cold rain that seemed to seep into everything. The sky remained perpetually gray, pressing down on the city.
Strategy work initiated across all departments. Jay didn't participate in the actual strategic process—that remained the domain of senior analysts and executives—but the workload increased for everyone, which meant his management tasks multiplied accordingly. Tension was everywhere. Most of the team worked long hours, arriving early and leaving late.
Daily lunch outings were suspended indefinitely, replaced with takeout eaten at desks while reviewing documents. The office felt like a bunker, everyone hunkered down against the storm of demands.
Jay scheduled his meeting with the agent for Wednesday at six. On Monday he worked long hours, supporting Ian's immediate correspondence and managing the endless stream of administrative tasks. 
Tuesday he managed to escape for the gym. Rus greeted him with raised eyebrows.
"Two weeks in a row. I'm impressed."
"Don't get used to it. Next week will probably be worse."
"At least you're here now."
Jay pushed through his exercises, trying to work out the tension in his shoulders. It helped, but not enough. Rus spent the entire session complaining about the weather.
"It's like the sky is punishing us for something. When does it end?"
"Not anytime soon, according to the forecast."
"Fantastic. Just fantastic."
It rained again on Wednesday. Jay watched it streak down the office windows all afternoon, a downpour that showed no signs of stopping. At five, he packed up and headed for the metro station.
The station was chaos. A harried employee stood at the entrance with a megaphone, announcing that service was suspended citywide due to flooding. A tunnel had filled with water somewhere in the central district, shutting down the entire network.
Jay processed this information for a moment, then turned and headed back to street level. He'd have to take a taxi. The traffic would be terrible, but he had no other option.
He was right about the traffic. It was insane. Cars barely moved, trapped in gridlock created by the metro outage and the continuing rain. Everyone who normally took public transport was now competing for road space. Jay watched the minutes tick by with growing anxiety, sending apologetic texts to the agent as his arrival time slipped further and further back.
He arrived almost an hour late, practically running from where the taxi finally deposited him. The agent was waiting in the lobby, looking patient but concerned.
"I'm so sorry. The metro is down and the traffic was—"
"It's quite alright. Half the city is dealing with the same situation. Shall we go up?"
They took the elevator to the flat. Jay had been looking forward to seeing it again, to confirming his decision with fresh eyes. Instead, he felt sour from the stressful journey.
The apartment was exactly as he remembered. Compact but brilliantly designed. The agent walked him through the features again, pointing out details about the appliances and the building amenities.
But when they reached the balcony, Jay stopped. Rain was still falling, lighter now but persistent. Beyond the railing, the river raged. The water was high and fast, churning with debris, looking dangerous and hostile in the darkness.
"The river seems quite swollen," Jay observed.
"It's been a wet winter. But the building is well above any flood zones. You can check the city's flood simulation maps if you're concerned."
"I did check them before. The building is on a slope, supposedly safe."
"Supposedly?"
"It just looks menacing."
The agent smiled reassuringly. "I understand. Weather like this makes everything seem more dramatic than it is."
They returned inside. Jay had initially intended to sign the preliminary contract right away, to commit and move forward. Instead, he hesitated.
"I'd like to take the contract home to review it. Just to make sure everything’s done properly."
"Of course. Take all the time you need."
The agent handed over the documents in a neat folder, and they parted ways with promises to be in touch soon. At least the rain had stopped, though the sky remained dark and the air was damp.
Jay walked around the neighborhood instead of immediately calling a taxi. He wanted to get a feel for the area at night, to see if it still felt as appealing as it had during his previous visit.
It didn't. The parks that had looked inviting in daylight now appeared desolate. The trees were bare and skeletal, dripping water onto empty pathways. Streetlights created isolated pools of illumination surrounded by shadows. Jay thought he saw someone lurking near one of the park entrances—a figure that disappeared when he looked directly at it.
He told himself he was being paranoid. This was a safe neighborhood. People paid premium prices to live here precisely because it was secure and well-maintained. But the darkness and anxiety colored everything.
He found a restaurant and went inside. The place was elegant, all white tablecloths and subtle lighting. The other diners were couples in expensive clothing, speaking in low voices.
He ordered something simple and ate quickly, feeling out of place. The food was good but too refined, too expensive. Jay just wanted sustenance.
Afterwards, he walked some more. Almost without conscious decision, he approached Ian's building. It really was just a short walk away. Twelve minutes. Jay could confirm that estimate now.
He loitered outside the entrance, looking up at the tall structure. Lights glowed in some windows. Others were dark. He tried to pick out which one was Ian’s. He had a rough idea from before, but it was little more than a guess.
It was past eight when a car pulled up. Ian emerged and called Jay immediately.
"Jay? What are you doing here?"
Jay felt sheepish, caught in what felt like strange behavior even though he'd done nothing wrong. "I had an apartment viewing today. It got prolonged because of the metro situation. I was just seeing around the area."
"In the dark? In this weather?"
"I wanted to get a feel for the neighborhood."
"Still." Ian looked at him more closely. "Have you eaten?"
"Yes, just now."
"There's a café nearby that I like. We can have tea."
Jay followed. The café was small and warm, with minimal decoration and pleasant atmosphere. They ordered herbal teas since it seemed too late for coffee.
Jay wanted something warming to dispel the chill that had seeped into his bones. Instead, the tea turned out bitter and medicinal, just increasing his overall poor mood. He sipped it anyway, not wanting to seem ungrateful.
"How was the viewing?" Ian asked.
"Fine. The apartment is exactly as I remembered."
"You don't sound enthusiastic."
"I'm just tired. The journey was difficult. And anxious about the apartment. Big decision."  
"You don't have to proceed if you're having doubts."  
"I know. I just wish I felt more certain."
They talked about the neighborhood, about the convenience of the location. Ian mentioned his favorite routes through several of the parks Jay had just found so unsettling.
"It's lovely in spring," Ian said. "Everything blooms. Very different from tonight's atmosphere."
"I'm sure it is."
But Jay couldn't shake his unease. The river, the dark parks, the feeling of being watched. All of it clung to him like the dampness in the air.
They finished their tea and said their farewells outside the café. Jay called a taxi, and Ian waited with him until it arrived.
"Get some rest," Ian said. "You look exhausted."
"I will. Thank you for the tea."
Jay returned home feeling weary. Ian watched the taxi disappear, worry creasing his forehead. Something was wrong. Jay had looked tired and anxious, his brightness dimmed.
The next day at work was another session of long hours. The entire team, Jay included, worked past ten because on top of the normal workload, a client issue emerged that required immediate attention.
Ela was near tears by nine. "I can't look at another spreadsheet. I physically cannot."
"Just one more hour," Max said, though he looked equally defeated. "We're almost there."
"That's what you said two hours ago."
"This time I mean it."
Jay returned home with aching eyes and tense shoulders. He showered quickly and dropped into bed without eating. Sleep came immediately, heavy and dreamless. He was exhausted. Completely, utterly exhausted. And February had only just begun.
Scene 2
Database drama
The same gray sky and persistent drizzle that had plagued the entire week continued on Friday. Another day of ungodly long hours stretched ahead.
By evening, everyone was still hard at work. The office seemed like a submarine—sealed off from the outside world, running on artificial light and recycled air, everything slightly stale and oppressive.
Jay was helping Kim with database tasks. They'd been working on cleaning up some analytical queries, and Kim had shown him the basic procedures earlier in the week.
Jay had been working with a temporary table for processing a minor query. He'd finished with it and wanted to clean up. He copied the table name and executed the drop command.
The confirmation came back instantly. Table dropped. Jay stared at the screen. Something felt wrong. He scrolled up to look at what he'd actually executed.
His stomach dropped through the floor.
He hadn't pasted the temporary table name. He'd pasted the name of an actual table. One holding historical scoring data. Months of accumulated information, gone in a single keystroke.
Cold sweat broke out across his body immediately. His hands started shaking.
"No," he whispered. "No, no, no."
He frantically tried to undo it, knowing even as he did that it was impossible. You couldn't undo a drop. The data was gone. He checked the backup procedures, his heart hammering. This was the analytical schema, not one of the production ones. There was no automatic backup.
"Oh god. Oh god no."
He sat frozen for five minutes, staring at the screen, hoping somehow he'd misread what happened. But the reality was grim. He'd dropped a table they were actively using for multiple strategy processes. It wasn't on the list of absolutely crucial systems—the company wouldn't stop functioning—but it was still serious. Very serious.
And it was exactly the mistake he'd been warned multiple times never to commit. Don't accidentally drop a table. It had been one of the first things he'd learned when Kim started training him on database work.
He'd done it anyway.
Finally, moving like he was underwater, Jay got up and walked to Kim's desk. His face was pale, his hands still trembling.
Kim looked up. "Hey, did you finish—" He stopped. "What's wrong?"
"I made a mistake. A bad one."
"What kind of mistake?"
"I dropped a table. The scoring history table."
Kim's expression went blank. "You dropped it."
"Yes."
"The whole table."
"Yes."
Kim was quiet for a moment. "Okay. Okay, we need to tell Ian."
They walked to Ian's office together. Through the glass wall, Jay could see Ian reviewing documents. Kim knocked once and entered without waiting for permission.
Ian looked up. His eyes went immediately to Jay's face, and he furrowed his brows.  "What happened?"
"Jay dropped the scoring history table," Kim said. His tone was factual, not accusatory.
"Do we have a backup?"
"No. It's the analytical schema."
"Right." Ian was already reaching for his phone. "Contact emergency IT intervention immediately. We need retrieval specialists."
Kim nodded and pulled out his own phone, stepping aside to make the call.
Ian looked at Jay. "How did this happen?"
"I was cleaning up a temporary table. I copied the wrong name. I didn't check before I executed." Jay's voice was barely above a whisper. "I'm sorry. I'm so sorry."
"We'll deal with it. Go back to your desk. Kim will handle the IT report."
Jay wanted to say more, wanted to apologize again, wanted Ian to yell at him. But Ian already returned to his computer, drafting contingency communications. Focused on damage control, not blame.
Jay returned to his desk. Around him, the team had gone quiet. Word had spread, and the atmosphere grew even heavier. No one looked at him directly. They just stared at their screens with resigned expressions, the weight of yet another problem pressing down on everyone.
Zoe caught his eye briefly and sent him a sympathetic grimace. 
There was nothing to do now but wait for IT to determine if the data was retrievable. The table existed somewhere in the system's memory, possibly, if they could access the right logs before they cycled. But it was late. The on-call specialists would need time to respond.
Jay tried to return to other work but couldn't focus. The words and numbers on his screen were unintelligible. His eyes burned.
He'd failed. Spectacularly. Made exactly the mistake everyone was trained to avoid, a basic, stupid error that shouldn't happen. And he'd done it in the middle of strategy season, when they were already stretched impossibly thin, when everyone was stressed and running on fumes.
At eleven, Ian emerged from his office. "Everyone go home. We'll reconvene on Monday."
People began packing up slowly, exhaustion written into every movement. A few offered reassuring words to Jay as they left.
"It happens," Amy said.
"Could've been worse," Max added, which wasn't particularly comforting.
Kim paused at Jay's desk. "IT will figure something out."
"I'm sorry."
"I know. Go home. Get some rest."
Jay was the last to leave. He stood outside Ian's office door, trying to find words.
Ian looked up. "Go home, Jay."
"I don't know how this happened. I always double-check table names. I was warned about this a hundred times."
"I know. It happened. Now we deal with it."
"If they can't retrieve it—"
"We'll handle it."
As Jay was leaving, he could see Ian still in his office, phone pressed to his ear, coordinating with someone. Jay didn't say goodbye. He just gathered his things and walked to the elevator.
The metro ride felt suffocating. The fluorescent lights were too bright. Every station stop felt interminable.
He climbed the stairs to his apartment with leaden steps, unlocked the door, and went inside. He didn't turn on any lights. Just stripped off his clothes—jacket, shirt, trousers all dropped in a pile on the floor—and crawled into bed wearing only his underwear.
The tears came immediately, hot and shameful. He pressed his face into the pillow to muffle the sounds. His entire body shook with it—the fear, the humiliation, the crushing weight of having failed so badly at something so fundamental.
He hadn't eaten. Hadn't washed. He just cried until exhaustion finally pulled him under into sleep.
Outside, the rain started again, pattering against the window like an accusation.
Scene 3
Packing
Saturday arrived and Jay stayed in bed until noon, staring at the ceiling. He only got up when biology demanded it, moving through his tiny apartment like a ghost.
He'd skipped the gym. The thought of seeing Rus and having to pretend everything was fine was unbearable. He just wanted to hide.
Eventually he got dressed in sweatpants and stared at his apartment. The contract lay on the table where he'd left it days ago in an official folder. Jay couldn't look at it. Every time his eyes drifted in that direction, his stomach twisted.
He needed something to occupy his mind, to stop the endless replay of Friday evening. So he focused on packing and sorting.
Summer clothes went into one box. Books into another. He organized old documents, separating the ones he deemed necessary from those destined for the throwaway pile. Tax records, rental agreements, pay stubs from jobs he'd left behind—all of it got categorized.
He didn't own quite that many things. By the end of the weekend, he was mostly done. Only the items he used daily remained unpacked—toiletries, a few changes of clothes, basic kitchen supplies.
His apartment looked sad. Boxes stacked against walls, empty shelves, the sense of a space already abandoned.
He felt less sure than ever about the move, about buying an apartment that was so ridiculously upscale. That wasn't his world. Maybe he should move, but back to his town. The slow, boring life in the boonies would probably suit him better than this impossibly demanding city landscape. At least there, expectations were manageable. Mistakes weren't catastrophic.
While clearing out his bookshelf, Jay retrieved an envelope he normally stored hidden behind a row of textbooks. Ten thousand in two-hundred bills, placed neatly in an unassuming envelope. His emergency buffer.
He'd assembled it years ago, after his first job failed and he'd had to take a loan from his mother. The shame of that had burned. After he found a new job, he'd taken a part-time position for several months to repay her and to build a more robust emergency net. Having cash on hand made him feel safer. If something happened—if he lost everything again—at least he'd have this.
These days it wasn't as needed. His bank account was impressive. His job felt stable.
But that evening, as he held the solid envelope in his fingers, he felt precarious. The mistake he'd made probably wasn't severe enough to get him fired. But it wasn't his first mistake. It was a pattern.
The demands of the job were high. He'd always known that. His colleagues pushed through worse, but they were more qualified. More resilient. And he wasn't.
He wasn't sure he could endure much more of this, each one of his failures feeling so crushing. Ian had once told him that bad things happen and will keep happening. Ian was strong—he could withstand disasters. But Jay was increasingly convinced that he himself wasn't.
Maybe he should look for a lower-stakes position. Processing invoices, just like he used to. There had been none of this enormous burden, none of this stress. He was starting to wonder if any of it was worth it, if this misery was sustainable.
He placed the envelope on the table next to the apartment contract, wondering where he should pack it. Putting it in a box seemed too insecure, even though some of the items already packed were probably worth more. His designer outfits and three-piece suits were already tucked away, after all.
Sunday evening, he tidied up the apartment and threw away the trash bags, inspecting his handiwork. His place looked more or less ready to be vacated. All of his belongings stuck in several neat boxes, a life reduced to manageable containers.
But was he ready? He wasn't sure anymore. He felt that whatever future held for him, he probably wouldn't stay where he was. But where he'd go—that remained unclear.
He took a proper shower, the first real one since Thursday. The hot water felt good against his tense shoulders. He prepared his things for Monday. Suit pressed, shirt ironed, everything laid out and ready.
Tomorrow he would receive his sentence.
He lay in bed staring at the ceiling. The apartment was too quiet. The boxes loomed in the darkness like silent witnesses to his failure. Sleep came eventually, restless and thin.
Monday was gray and cold. Jay got dressed, ate breakfast without tasting it, and took the metro to work. His stomach was in knots the entire journey.
At the office, tension radiated from him like heat. He sat at his desk, trying to focus on his tasks, but his attention kept drifting to his email. Waiting. There was no news from IT until eleven. Then the message finally arrived, sent to Ian with the team copied.
"Table successfully restored from system logs. All historical data recovered."
Everyone breathed. The relief was palpable, spreading through the workspace. Kim sent Jay a thumbs up from across the room.
Jay felt as if a stone had fallen from his heart. His mistake was fixed. Thankfully, mercifully fixed.
But it didn't take away from the severity of his error. The crushing awareness that he'd made a mistake he'd been trained to avoid. That next time might not resolve so successfully. That the IT team had worked over the weekend to fix his stupidity.
Ian called him into his office at noon.
"The table is restored. We're back on track. Let's move forward."
"I'm sorry," Jay said again, because he couldn't help it.
"I know. But it's resolved now. Don't let it consume you."
Easy for Ian to say. Ian was strong enough to move past disasters.
That day, the whole team worked long hours again. The strategy season continued, relentless and demanding. Jay stayed until nine, throwing himself into assignments.
He returned home feeling marginally better. But only marginally.
The boxes in his apartment reminded him that his life was in flux, that everything felt unstable, that he wasn't sure he belonged anywhere anymore. He heated up leftovers, ate them quickly, showered, and went to bed early. Sleep came faster this time, exhaustion finally overcoming anxiety.
But his dreams were full of falling tables and disappearing data, of Ian's disappointed face and his own inadequacy laid bare for everyone to see.
Scene 4
Dread
The next day was Tuesday, so Jay left at five to go to the gym. Rus mercifully didn't comment on his absence last Saturday, but his eyes said enough.
Jay's form had slipped visibly. He used to occasionally work out at home, maintaining his strength between sessions. That had ceased completely in the past couple of weeks. Combined with his missed gym session and lack of sleep, he struggled with the exercises. Weights that had felt manageable before now seemed heavy. His movements were sloppy.
Rus watched him fail a set and shook his head. "You need another job. This one is going to kill you."
Jay didn't respond. Internally, he agreed. The strain was visible to the naked eye.
He returned home and at least cooked a decent dinner. Chicken and vegetables, nothing fancy but with proper nutrients. After eating, he decided to finish packing his documents.
He went to the coffee table where he'd left the money envelope. It wasn't there.
Jay stared at the empty surface for a moment, then looked around. Maybe he'd moved it. He checked the kitchen counter, the bookshelf, his desk. Nothing.
He looked under the table. In the boxes. Behind furniture. Nowhere.
He tried to remember. He'd taken it out of the bookshelf Saturday. Held it. Placed it on the table. And then... Sunday evening, he'd cleaned up. Tidied. Thrown away the pile of useless documents that had accumulated on the table.
Unless.
Cold sweat broke out across his back. Unless he'd mistakenly thrown it away with the rest of the pile. Just grabbed everything and dumped it in the trash without checking.
This was somehow even worse than the table incident. That had been a work mistake, serious but ultimately recoverable. This was personal. This was his safety net, his emergency buffer. Money he'd worked like a dog for at that dreadful weekend job at the gas station.
He'd hated every moment of those months. The rude customers, the unsafe neighbourhood, the harassment he'd endured. Standing behind bulletproof glass, getting yelled at by drunk people at two in the morning. All to build this buffer, to never have to borrow from his mother again.
The amount wasn't small. Over two months of his old salary. While he earned so much more now, it was still nothing to scoff at.
But it wasn't just about the money. It was about the sacrifice. About what that envelope represented—his determination to never be helpless again. And he'd thrown it away like garbage. Just like he'd dropped that table. Just like he kept making careless, stupid mistakes that proved he was fundamentally deficient.
Jay spent the entire evening looking. He checked every box twice. He moved furniture. He searched through drawers. But his apartment wasn't that big. If it wasn't there, it was gone.
The trash got collected Mondays. Even if he wanted to go search his trash bags, it was too late.
He sat down on the floor with his head in his hands and cried for a long time, allowing the misery to consume him. The sobs were ugly and harsh, his whole body shaking with them.
Eventually he dragged himself to the shower, still crying. The water mixed with tears. He cried himself to sleep for the second time in a week, and slept poorly, waking repeatedly from formless nightmares.
Wednesday morning, he went to work feeling more defeated than ever. The metro ride was dreary. His reflection in the dark windows looked haggard.
It was obvious to him now that he couldn't go on like this anymore. The apartment was a stupid idea. This work had been a mistake.
He was happy to have met Ian. Just weeks ago he’d stood beside him in a kitchen full of light and cinnamon. Now every word he’d said then sounded ridiculous—like someone pretending to be worthy of that warmth. He still treasured the memories they'd shared, but it all felt so distant, like it had happened in another life. To a different person who'd been braver and more capable. 
He couldn't stay here. Ian couldn't shield him from himself. He shouldn't need to. Someone like Jay would only drag Ian down.
The oppressive gloom of the winter weather made his spirit heavier. During a quieter moment, Jay stepped outside to make a phone call. The agent answered on the second ring.
"I need to cancel the apartment purchase. A sudden money situation emerged. I can't move forward right now."
The agent was quiet for a moment. "I see. That's unfortunate. If the situation improves, please call me. I'll keep the property on hold for you for now."
"Thank you."
Jay hung up and looked at his watch. The gift from Ian, beautiful and expensive. He didn't deserve it. He didn't deserve the apartment or this work or security. His place was at a gas station in a rough neighbourhood. At least there, no one expected anything from him. There was no one to disappoint.
Ian could see that Jay looked even worse today than yesterday. The concern was becoming difficult to ignore. He didn't want to be overbearing, but he also wanted to help. The last time Jay had made a mistake, his bad mood had lifted eventually. But this time seemed different. Worse, somehow.
Thursday wasn't better. Neither was Friday morning. At six on Friday evening, Ian finally decided to intervene. He called Jay to his office. Jay entered and stood near the door, not meeting Ian's eyes.
"Sit down, please," Ian said gently.
Jay sat.
"I wanted to check in with you. I know this period is difficult. The strain gets to everyone, but I've noticed you seem particularly affected. Is there anything I can do to help?"
Jay didn't speak for a long moment. Then he shook his head. Just once, a tiny motion that conveyed nothing.
"Jay, talk to me. What's going on?"
"I'm fine. Just tired."
"You don't look fine."
"I'll manage."
Ian tried a different approach. "Everyone makes mistakes. The table incident was resolved. It's not something you need to keep thinking about."
"I know."
But Jay's didn't believe it. His shoulders were hunched, his hands clasped tightly in his lap. He didn't look like someone who'd made a mistake at work. He looked like someone who'd given up on himself.
Ian felt helpless. "If you need time off—"
"I don't need time off. May I go back to my desk?"
"Of course. But my door is always open if you want to talk."
Jay nodded and left without another word.
Ian watched him go, worry knotting his stomach. Something was badly wrong, and he didn't know how to help. He didn't know how to reach Jay when he'd withdrawn so completely.
Jay sat at his desk and forced himself not to cry. Ian had to coddle him like a child, handle him carefully so he wouldn't fall apart. Some assistant he was. More like dead weight.
The office felt suffocating. Jay pulled up a spreadsheet and stared at it without seeing anything. 
Around him, his teammates worked. Ela was on a phone call. Kim typed rapidly. All of them competent. All of them managing the pressure without falling apart. All of them stronger than Jay would ever be. He didn't belong here. He'd known it from the beginning, really. The joke hire. And somehow he'd convinced himself otherwise, convinced himself he could do this. 
The day dragged on. Jay stayed until nine, same as everyone else. When he finally left, the relief of escaping was undercut by the knowledge that he'd have to come back Monday and do it all again.
He took the metro home, walked up to his apartment, and stood in the doorway looking at his packed boxes.
A life ready to be abandoned. The only question was where he'd go next.
Scene 5
Faith
Jay forced himself to go to the gym Saturday morning. He almost didn't. Leaving his apartment and facing other people was overwhelming. 
Rus took one look at him and frowned. "You look terrible."
"Thanks."
"I'm serious. When's the last time you slept properly?"
Jay couldn't remember. "I sleep fine."
"Right. You want to talk about it?"
"Nothing to talk about."
"Jay—"
"I'm fine. Let's just work out."
Jay's performance was worse than Tuesday. He struggled with weights that should have been easy. Halfway through, Rus stopped him.
"That's enough. You're going to hurt yourself."
"I can finish."
"No. You can't. Whatever's going on at that job, it's destroying you."
"I know."
"Do you? Because from where I'm standing, you're just letting it happen."
Jay wanted to argue but couldn't find the energy. Rus was right. He was letting it happen. Letting everything slip away—his health, his confidence, his safety nets. All of it sliding through his fingers like water.
"I'll figure it out," Jay said finally.
"When? After you collapse? After you end up in hospital?"
"It's not that bad."
"Isn't it?"
Jay left without answering.
The next two weeks were filled with self-pity. On the surface, he functioned. But anyone paying attention could see the difference.
Luc cornered him in the kitchen during a rare lunch break. "Hey. You doing okay?"
"Fine."
"You don't look fine."
"Just tired. We're all tired."
"Yeah, but... You seem different. Like something's really wrong."
"It's just the workload. I'll be fine once strategy season ends."
"Will you? Because it seems like more than that."
Jay smiled, a thin approximation of his normal cheerfulness. "I appreciate the concern, but really. I'm managing."
Luc didn't look convinced but let it drop.
At the gym, Rus was less diplomatic. "You're still wallowing."
"I'm not wallowing."
"You are. And it's painful to watch. Whatever happened, you need to either fix it or move on."
"It's not that simple."
"Staying like this isn't helping anyone, especially not yourself."
Jay knew Rus was right, but knowing didn't change anything. He felt trapped in amber—everything around him moving forward while he remained suspended, unable to break free.
Ian tried to intervene several times. Brief conversations in his office, diplomatically phrased questions about workload and wellbeing. But Jay deflected every attempt.
"I'm fine."
"Are you sure? You seem—"
"Just focused on work. There's a lot to do."
"If you need anything—"
"I know where to find you. Thank you."
Ian sat alone in his office late one evening after Jay had left, the lighter Jay gave him for Christmas resting in his palm. The engraved message mocked him: "You've got this."
Did he? Because it didn't feel like he had anything under control. Jay was slipping away, and Ian couldn't stop it.
They'd been so close already. Moments when Ian had felt truly connected to him. And now it felt like they'd taken five steps back—back to when Jay first started, when he'd learned about being a joke hire and closed himself off completely.
Ian turned the lighter over in his fingers. What could he do to solve this? Jay had seemed to have complete faith in him once. But now that faith seemed insufficient to keep him here.
The nightmare still haunted Ian. Jay bleeding out on marble floors, dying in his arms. And then there was the evening after the gala. The slip of his tongue, calling Jay beautiful. Had that been too much? A blunder that created an obstacle where there have been none? Ian replayed the moment constantly, trying to read Jay's reaction, but memory was unreliable and tainted by his own fear.
The obstacles kept multiplying. Work stress, mistakes, whatever personal crisis Jay was experiencing. And Ian felt powerless against all of it.
As days passed, the workload remained too heavy to really address anything properly. Ian worked fourteen-hour days at the office, then came home and worked more. Dusk till dawn, strategy documents and financial projections consuming every waking moment.
He couldn't abandon his duties to check on Jay, no matter how much he wanted to. He couldn't take an afternoon off to sit on Jay's small couch and drink and talk about what was actually wrong. The work demanded everything.
It was his fault the workload was this heavy. His decisions as CFO that led to this intensity, this pressure that crushed everyone beneath it. Jay was stressed and clearly taking the situation poorly, and Ian couldn't blame him. He could only blame himself.
Late Sunday night, Ian stood at his window looking out over the city. The lights stretched endlessly, thousands of windows with thousands of lives playing out behind them. Somewhere out there was Jay's apartment. Was Jay sleeping? Or was he awake like Ian, trapped in his own spiral?
Ian wanted to call. To text. To do something that bridged the distance between them. But what could he say? He'd already tried talking, offered help that Jay refused. Pushing harder would only drive Jay further away.
So Ian did nothing. Stood at his window and felt helpless, the lighter growing warm in his closed fist.
Ian went to the office on Monday early. Jay arrived exactly on time. They exchanged greetings, discussed the day's priorities and got consumed by work.
But it wasn't the same. Jay moved through the motions, and Ian watched him with growing dread.
Because this felt like the beginning of an ending. Like watching something precious slip through his fingers, unable to hold on no matter how tightly he tried to grasp it.
The office felt cold. The winter light through the windows was harsh and unforgiving. Strategy season would end eventually, but Ian was no longer certain what would remain when it did.
Jay worked at his desk, head down, focused on his screen. Ian could see him through the glass wall, close enough to call out to but impossibly distant.
And Ian didn't know how to cross that distance. All he could do was keep working, keep hoping, and watch as the person he cared about most slowly disappeared before his eyes.
Chapter 32: Alternatives
Scene 1
Job search
February was ending but brought no respite. At least a couple more weeks of insane workload continued ahead, with only a brief break before another season of quarterly reporting began. The cycle was relentless.
The weather continued to be wet, cold, and oppressive. Winter was dreadful this year. The city felt like it was drowning.
Among this drudgery, Jay decided to start looking for another job.
It was always awful for him, stressful and unpleasant. He'd spent years avoiding even the thought of job hunting. But he felt miserable and needed to at least think he was doing something to change it. Staying felt impossible. Continuing like this felt unsustainable.
He polished his CV on Sunday afternoon, sitting at his small table surrounded by packed boxes. Adding his current employment to his credentials looked surreal. Turner & Associates, Assistant to the CFO. The words sat there on the page, impressive and damning in equal measure. One year of experience in high-stakes investment management.
He was worried it would only bring the wrong kind of attention. People would wonder why he was leaving such a prestigious position. They'd suspect he'd been fired or had done something wrong. Or they'd assume he was reaching above his actual capabilities.
He sent the CVs all afternoon, working through a list of over fifty companies that looked like places he could manage. Accounting firms. Administrative positions. Jobs where mistakes weren't catastrophic.
Over the following week, he received zero responses. Not a single one.
He checked his email obsessively, refreshing during every break, hoping for something. But his inbox remained empty except for automated rejection messages from companies with well organised HR departments.
He guessed it was on par for someone like him, and it only made him more insecure. Of course no one would want him. His fragile, bruised ego got another blow.
Work continued its brutal pace. The team pushed through strategy revisions, endless meetings, document reviews that stretched into the night. Jay tried to act normal. Ian tried to engage him in conversation a few times, but Jay kept his responses brief. He didn't want Ian to see how much he was falling apart.
Saturday came and he went to the gym out of habit more than desire. Rus noticed immediately that something was off.
"You're distracted today."
"Just tired."
"You're always tired these days. What's going on?"
Jay hesitated, then decided there was no point in hiding it. "I resigned from buying the apartment. I'm looking for a new job. Something less stressful."
Rus's expression was complicated. "Oh. That's... are you sure?"
"I'm sure I can't keep doing this."
"I mean, I get it. Your work sounds unreasonable. And not buying the apartment makes sense if you're changing jobs, it would be hard to manage a place that posh on a regular salary. But you don't look happy about it. Or relieved."
"I'm not."
"Then why—"
"Because I'm not good enough. My coworkers manage the demands much better. It's just me who keeps making mistakes. Who keeps failing. Who keeps being toppled by the stress."
"That's not—"
"It is true. I dropped an entire database table. A basic, stupid mistake that anyone with proper training wouldn't make. I'm barely holding on while everyone else seems fine."
"They probably aren't as fine as they seem."
"Maybe. But they're managing better than I am."
"Come get drinks tonight. You need to talk this through properly."
"I can't. I need the rest when I can get it. I'm barely sleeping as it is."
"Alright. But if you change your mind, text me."
Jay continued sending his CV over the following days, browsing company listings with resignation. Most places didn't feel right. Some were too similar to his first job—small firms where he'd be vulnerable. Others were looking for someone more qualified than he was.
Finally, as March started, someone contacted him. A consulting firm looking for an administrative coordinator. The pay was roughly half of what he currently made. The responsibilities seemed manageable. They wanted to schedule an interview.
Jay stared at the email for a long time before responding to confirm his availability.
He knew an interview probably meant nothing. He'd done plenty of interviews that landed him nowhere in the past. Getting called in didn't mean getting hired. Still, it was a step somewhere. Progress, maybe, or at least motion.
He looked through the glass wall at Ian, who was hard at work reviewing documents. His posture was perfect, his focus absolute. Jay felt something twist painfully in his chest.
He'd have to leave this place. Never see Ian again.
The thought made him miserable instead of bringing relief. His eyes burned with unshed tears that he blinked back furiously.
Ian was the best thing that ever happened to him. The kindest person he'd ever known. The only person who'd ever made him feel valued. He would never meet someone like him again.
Leaving his side felt unbearably crushing.
Jay turned back to his computer, trying to focus on the spreadsheet in front of him. He took a deep breath, then another, willing himself to hold it together.
Just a few more weeks of strategy season. The interview. Then maybe an offer, if he was lucky. Then a resignation letter. Then packing up his desk and walking away from this office, from this team, from Ian.
And that would be it. The best year of his life, reduced to a line on his CV that no one would believe anyway.
He worked until late that evening, staying long after most of the team had gone home. Ian was still in his office when Jay finally packed up at ten-thirty. Their eyes met briefly through the glass, and Ian raised a hand in farewell.
Jay waved back, then gathered his things and left.
He had an interview on Thursday. He needed to prepare, to figure out what to say when they asked why he was leaving such a prestigious position. He couldn't tell them the truth—that he wasn't good enough, that he kept making mistakes, that the stress was eating him alive. That he'd rather earn half the salary and live in his cramped studio forever than continue feeling like he was inadequate.
He'd have to come up with something. Career development. Seeking new challenges. Better alignment with his long-term goals. All lies, but acceptable ones.
Jay arrived at his apartment and looked at the boxes still stacked against the walls. He'd have to unpack them eventually. This studio would be his home for the foreseeable future. No river view, no clever storage, no balcony for morning coffee.
Just this small room with its narrow bed and tiny kitchen and the constant feeling that his life had gotten too big for the space and then shrunk back down to fit.
The apartment contract still sat on the table. He should probably throw it away. Or send an email to the agent officially declining. But he couldn't bring himself to do it yet. That would make it final.
Scene 2
Requesting a day off
The next day at work, HR sent an email reminding everyone about the upcoming retreat. Jay stared at the subject line. Apparently this was already the third email sent about this.
He remembered seeing the previous ones and filing them away without even looking at them. There had been no time to spare, and planning months ahead felt impossible when each day was a struggle to survive.
Now he actually read it.
The email was enthusiastic, full of exclamation points and glowing reviews of the venue. This year's retreat would be at a lakeside resort six hours south by bus, in a mountain region, scheduled for the end of May. The photos showed an upscale and opulent facility that still managed to look rustic, matching its natural setting. Crystal clear lakes, amazing hiking trails, brilliant vistas. The HR department promised varied and exciting entertainment and activities.
Jay smiled bitterly. It was unlikely he'd even still be there. Maybe he'd be gone altogether, or would have already handed in his resignation. There was no reason to think about it, to imagine himself at some resort months from now when he couldn't envision making it through the next week.
Yet he still read the entire email. He scrolled through all the photos and examined the list of planned activities.
The area looked beautiful. Peaceful. A place that existed in a different world from the gray, rain-soaked city pressing down on him.
He bet Zoe would be overjoyed. Luc would probably grumble about the long bus ride.
The workload that day was manageable enough that his colleagues actually discussed the retreat. Jay listened to their conversations with detachement, like observing people through glass.
"I'm disappointed about the room arrangements. No sharing this year. Everyone gets singles," Kim said to Ela.
Ela's response was too quiet to hear, but both of them smiled conspiratorially, which made Jay certain that last year's retreat was when they'd started hooking up. Or maybe they'd already been involved before. Either way, the shared room had clearly been a highlight.
"Finally, entertainment I'll actually enjoy. A fashion show! Thank god. Last year's activities were too artsy," Amy declared, reviewing the email on her screen. 
"I'm excited about it too. We should start thinking about outfits now," Ela said. 
"Absolutely. I'm thinking something elegant but comfortable. Resort chic."
They were already deep in discussion about color palettes and accessories.
Zoe was predictably excited about the hiking trails. "Look at this elevation map. Some of these routes go up to twelve hundred meters. The views will be incredible."
Kim was pumped about the oldies-themed disco. "I'm going to dance to songs from before I was born. It's going to be amazing."
Luc was surprisingly enthusiastic about horse archery. "This is brilliant. I've always wanted to try this. It's like something from a historical movie."
Jay honestly laughed at that. It was probably the most unorthodox of the activities offered. Of course Luc would love it.
Luc turned to him. "You should join me. How often do you get to shoot arrows from horseback?"
"Never, and I'm keeping it that way. I'm not riding horses."
"Come on. It'll be fun."
"No. Categorically no."
Max was excited about the boats. "There's kayaking and canoeing. I haven't been on the water in years. This will be wonderful."
It seemed everyone found something they were looking forward to. Even in the middle of strategy season's misery, the prospect of the retreat gave them something bright on the horizon.
Luc approached Jay. "You seem weird about this."
"I'm fine."
"We'll talk about it properly in two weeks, after things calm down. But you're coming, right? It's absolutely mandatory."
Jay just smiled and didn't answer.
He remembered the previous resort. The single most pleasant, exciting, and memorable trip he'd ever been on. The party with the amazing view where he'd actually relaxed and enjoyed himself for once. Slow mornings with Ian in their shared room, drinking coffee on the balcony. The diving lessons, the bonfires, the art show. All of it had been new, enchanting, magical.
He'd felt like he belonged there, like he was part of something special. Like he deserved to be in that beautiful place with these talented people.
He was sure this year's retreat would be similarly successful. His colleagues would have a blast. The resort looked incredible. They'd create new memories, strengthen their bonds, return refreshed and energized.
But he wouldn't be there.
Jay had other things to handle, to worry about. Practical matters that couldn't wait for some mythical future when everything would be better.
He went to Ian's office mid-afternoon and knocked on the glass.
Ian looked up immediately. "Come in."
"I need to request a day off. Thursday."
"Of course. Do you need anything? Company car rental, perhaps? If you're traveling somewhere—"
"No. Thank you. I'll manage."
"Are you sure?"
"Yes."
Ian clearly wanted to ask more, to understand what was happening. Jay felt the weight of that attention, the care behind it. Finally, Ian nodded.
"You have the day. If there's anything you need, anything at all, I'll do my best to provide it."
"I appreciate that."
Jay returned to his desk feeling sad. Ian was such an amazing man, such a great boss. In every aspect. Thoughtful, supportive, generous. He cared about his team, about their wellbeing. When Jay was clearly struggling, Ian was trying to help.
He was wasted on someone as pathetic as Jay.
Leaving was for the best. Ian deserved to only work with the most distinguished professionals. People who could match his excellence, who wouldn't make stupid mistakes or lose emergency funds or drop database tables.
There was a time when Jay had thought he was good enough to stay by Ian's side, to support him. Now the mere idea seemed ridiculous. 
He wasn't even good enough to safeguard his own savings. How could he possibly be of aid to Ian? How could he help him in any way?
He was only a burden. And the kindest thing he could do was remove that burden before he caused any more damage.
Jay pulled up his work queue and focused on the tasks in front of him. Practical things. Manageable things. One item at a time until the day ended and he could go home.
For now, he had Thursday. Whatever happened then would determine what came next.
Scene 3
The interview
Jay had the whole day off on Thursday and the interview was at two in the afternoon. He wasn't nervous, more resigned than anything. This was an act of desperation more than anything else. Whether he got the job or not felt irrelevant. 
He spent the morning reading about the company. It couldn't hurt to be prepared. It was a mid-sized firm specializing in financial services for small to medium businesses. A place that had existed for twenty years and would probably exist for twenty more without ever making headlines.
He wore one of his regular office suits, a navy two-piece that fit him perfectly. It was by any standards a presentable outfit, well-tailored and appropriate. He took his watch off and placed it on the table. The watch was too expensive, too distinctive. He didn't want to invite scrutiny. His wrist without it felt too light, like something important was missing.
He didn't take his leather bag, either. It seemed somehow wrong to carry equipment provided by his current employer to a job interview. 
He arrived comfortably before the appointed time and walked around the area. At least it wasn't raining, even if it was cold and gloomy. The building complex was in the business district, filled with offices of dozens of middle-class companies. Nothing special, nothing terrible. It felt comfortable in its ordinariness.
He entered the company with fifteen minutes to spare and got seated in a corridor with a couple of other candidates. The reception was plain—white walls, standard furniture, a few potted plants.
Jay immediately realized he looked overdressed. His suit fit too well, while the other men wore department store clothes. Nothing wrong with them, really. But Jay stood out. He felt slightly awkward, but hardly intimidated. That surprised him. A year ago, this situation would have sent his anxiety through the roof.
Another candidate left the office, looking flustered. He said his farewells clumsily and departed hurriedly, clutching his bag.
Jay waited for his turn. He'd read about the company extensively beforehand, learned about the market, the specifications, their recent projects. It was as good a place as any, if unremarkable.
When his turn came, he was led into a conference room where three people sat behind a table. The hiring panel. Two men and a woman, all dressed in business casual. They smiled as he entered.
"Mr. Hall, thank you for coming. Please, have a seat."
Jay sat and tried to judge the company culture from their appearance and behaviour. They looked normal. Friendly but not overly warm.
"Would you like some water?"
"Yes, thank you."
At least that seemed acceptable. Basic courtesy was being observed.
They asked him general questions about his work style, his strengths, his approach to problem-solving. He answered truthfully but without elaboration. When they moved to his employment history, he outlined his previous positions clearly, without mentioning the reasons why he'd quit any of them.
"And your current position at Turner & Associates? That's quite prestigious. What makes you interested in a change?"
"The work is ambitious and definitely a challenge I've enjoyed. But ultimately I'd like to advance my career in a different direction."
It was a blatant lie, but he delivered it confidently. What else was there to do?
"And why did you choose our company?"
Jay recited a dozen reasons about why he was interested in this particular market niche, their growth trajectory, their reputation in the field. All lies, naturally. He'd chosen this company because it was hiring for a position vaguely aligned with his skills. That was the extent of his interest.
He was surprised by how easily he lied. How relaxed he felt about all of this. Perhaps because he didn't care about the outcome.
The woman asked about his technical skills. He listed them systematically—database management, financial reporting, scheduling systems, correspondence protocols. All things he could do in his sleep now.
One of the men asked, "Here's a hypothetical. How would you sell an elephant?"
Jay responded with a dry joke. "I'd find an expedient butcher and market the meat by weight." 
The panel laughed. He felt slight distaste. At Turner & Associates, no one would ask trick questions. On his interview with Leo back then, he'd been offered proper refreshments. The panel had been polite and friendly despite him being a nobody and Leo being practically the company owner. The questions had been exclusively substantive—about his skills, his work style, his career goals.
The difference in standards was noticeable.
They asked about his salary expectations. He named a figure that was half what he currently made but still reasonable for the position. They seemed pleased.
He knew he was making a good impression without really trying. Months of experience at the highest level had seasoned him. The nervousness that had plagued him at his first interview was completely absent.
The interview concluded after fifteen minutes. They shook his hand, said they'd be in touch within a week, and thanked him for his time.
When he finally left, he didn't feel any particular way about the people or the position. They were well-mannered enough, no obvious red flags. The work would be manageable, the environment seemed stable. It was more at his level. Mediocre employees of a mediocre institution. People like him.
He took the metro home and let himself into his apartment. The boxes still lined the walls. The contract for the apartment he'd never buy still sat on the table.
Jay laid down on the bed and thought about what his new life might look like. Fifteen-minute commute to the business district. Sad sandwiches in a brown bag for lunch. Spending his time off in local parks instead of on tropical diving destinations. Just as he used to.
He didn't feel sad about any of it. He didn't need the luxury, the excitement. Those things had never really been for him anyway.
But then he thought about never seeing Ian again.
Never having their evening conversations over coffee and pastries. Never watching him work through the glass wall. Never hearing his practical observations. Never seeing him smile when something amused him.
Jay rolled onto his side in a fetal position and began crying.
He could survive without the money and the status and the beautiful things. He'd survived without them for most of his life. He could live without the diving trips and the company retreats. He could live without feeling like he belonged somewhere important.
But having to live and never see Ian again felt devastating. Like someone was slowly carving his heart from his chest with a dull knife.
He cried until his throat hurt and his eyes burned. The apartment grew dark around him as evening came, but he didn't get up to turn on the lights. He just lay there, curled around the ache in his chest, mourning something he'd never really had in the first place.
Eventually the tears stopped, leaving him exhausted. He stared at the wall in the darkness and tried to imagine his future. That mediocre office, those polite but unremarkable colleagues, that stable and soul-crushing life. He tried to convince himself he could do this. He wasn't sure he believed it.
Scene 4
Foolish feelings
Jay went to work Friday looking visibly depressed. His eyes were red and puffy, evidence of crying that no amount of cold water could completely disguise. The whole team was staying late that evening, pushing through the final stretch before next week's deadline. But at five o'clock, Jay packed up his things.
Luc looked up, surprised. "Leaving already?"
"Yes."
"You okay?"
"Fine. Just tired."
He left without further explanation, feeling everyone's eyes on him as he walked to the elevator.
The next week would be the final push before they needed to finalize the new strategy. Everyone would work all weekend except Jay and Kim, since neither of them actually did the strategy work itself. Their support tasks could wait until Monday.
Jay should have felt relieved about the weekend off. Instead, he felt crushed. Because the interview had actually gone well. There was a good chance he'd get the job. And that would mean leaving Ian.
He was starting to think that whatever pain and anxiety he felt due to his job, none of it was even close to the pain of having to leave Ian. When had he become so attached? When had Ian become so central to his life, like oxygen?
He was confused. Mostly he was miserable. He didn't know anymore what he should do.
He knew he liked Ian. Respected him, admired him even. But it seemed that it was way more than that. Way deeper.
Jay returned to his apartment that afternoon but couldn't stand to sit there surrounded by his packed boxes. He needed to be around people.
He went to Café Lemon and was glad to find Fay there. It was quite busy since it was Friday afternoon, but he sat at a table and ordered coffee. Then another coffee. Then a third.
The afternoon turned into evening. The café gradually emptied as people went home for their weekends. Fay came over to refill his cup yet again.
"You've been sitting here for hours. Something on your mind?"
"Can I ask your advice about something?"
"Of course." She sat on the seat across from him. "What's going on?"
Jay tried to formulate his thoughts. "The work is great but very stressful. I decided to look for a new position and give up the apartment because I couldn't cope with the demands. But leaving means I'll never get to see a particular coworker anymore, and that seems extremely sad."
"A particular coworker?"
"Yes."
"What's special about this coworker?"
Jay smiled despite his misery. "They're the best person I've ever met. Incredibly talented and dedicated. They've been through so much but never let it break them. Strong but not cruel. Principled. They've been so kind to me, so supportive. They defend me when others won't. They make me want to be better just by being around them."
"Oh, honey. You're head over heels in love."
Jay blushed madly. "That's ridiculous. They're... unavailable. Taken."
"Ah." Fay's expression turned sympathetic. "Unrequited love is the worst. Maybe leaving really is best, then. It'll hurt like hell for a while, maybe even for months, but staying would just prolong the pain, and you'll eventually move on."
"I don't want to move on."
"That's the problem with love. We rarely want what's good for us.""
"Right. That makes sense."
"Does it help?"
"Not really."
Fay squeezed his hand. "I'm sorry. That's a terrible position to be in."
Jay returned home feeling worse than when he'd left. It was silly. He wasn't in love with Ian. He admired Ian, but Ian was someone he couldn't harbour such feelings about.
Ian was someone who was absolutely out of his reach for more than one reason. Ian had been betrayed before by someone in exactly Jay's position, had his heart broken and his reputation damaged. Ian would never risk that again.
Plus, Jay would never have romantic feelings for a supervisor. That was foolish. Inappropriate.
Except the feelings were there regardless of what was wise or appropriate.
Jay sat on his bed and tried to reason with himself. This was just attachment born of proximity and stress. Ian had been kind to him during difficult times. That naturally created strong positive feelings. It didn't mean anything deeper.
But he couldn't convince himself. The thought of never seeing Ian again felt like losing a limb. Something essential, something he'd built his life around without realizing it.
He didn't know what to do with that realization.
Meanwhile, Ian sat in his office long after everyone else had left, pretending to work on strategy documents while his mind circled the same problem repeatedly.
He strongly suspected Jay had gone to a job interview. It made sense. According to his estimates, it was ten percent chance Jay needed a rest day, ten percent it was a medical visit or family emergency, eighty percent he'd had a job interview.
All the signs pointed to that. When a stressed employee requested a day off with short notice, it meant one thing. Plus the long hours, the unreasonable pressure that resulted in mistakes, the constant draining social demands. The way Ian had probably made him uncomfortable with that comment after the gala. Jay's recent withdrawal.
His instincts were correct and Jay was pulling back. The work environment had turned hostile, and Jay was building an exit strategy.
So the fact that he'd come back from his day off looking defeated was actually a good sign. Naturally it pained Ian to see him suffer, but at the same time, if the interview had gone poorly, it bought time to remedy at least some of the problems.
One more week. One more week of the intense strategy work, and they'd have some breathing room. Then he'd be able to take corrective action.
They hadn't done yearly reviews because there simply hadn't been time. But Ian would make sure Jay felt valued. A raise, more favourable conditions, something that would make him feel more secure. A company car, whatever Jay needed. Maybe a promotion if he wanted it, or a transfer to another department if working directly under Ian was too difficult or if he wanted to advance his career in a different direction.
Jay didn't need to change companies. Everything could be provided here. Turner & Associates was large enough to accommodate different career paths, different working arrangements.
It didn't matter what solution they found, as long as Jay stayed in his orbit.
Ian would make sure to be as respectful and unthreatening as possible, to remedy whatever discomfort Jay was feeling. No overbearing gestures. Everything within the limits of their respective positions.
He’d been too forward. That was the problem. The Christmas celebration, the trips, the comment about Jay looking beautiful, the way he'd monopolized Jay's time during those late evening conversations. He'd overstepped, and Jay had rightly pulled back.
Ian would fix it. He could maintain distance if that's what Jay needed.
Ian should have focused on finalizing the strategy. The documents in front of him required his attention. Decisions needed to be made, projections verified, presentations prepared.
But his mind kept drifting to all the methods he would need to use to make Jay stay.
More autonomy, less direct pressure. Flexible hours. Additional vacation days. Compensation packages. Career advancement opportunities. Whatever it took.
The thought of Jay leaving was intolerable. Ian had lost too much already. He couldn't lose this too.
Ian opened a document on his computer and started drafting notes. Strategies for retention. Approaches to take during Jay's review. Benefits to offer, both tangible and intangible. This was what he was good at—strategy, planning, finding solutions to impossible problems.
He would make this work. He'd saved himself from ruin once. He could save this too.
Scene 5
Definitely not love
Saturday at the gym, Jay was barely through his warm-up when he stopped mid-rep and blurted, “Rus, what does it feel like to be in love?”
The question made Rus laugh so loudly that two people on the treadmills turned to stare. When he finally caught his breath he said, "Where did that come from?"
"Just answer the question."
Rus wiped his eyes, still grinning. "You can't stop thinking about the person. You can't imagine your life without them. Everything reminds you of them. Why?"
Jay went quiet.
"Wait. Is this about that secret person you used to go on dates with? The one who was out of your reach?"
Jay nodded slowly. "They weren't dates. And they're taken. But yeah. It's that person. I can't imagine my life without them. Does this necessarily have to mean I'm in love? Can't I just be deeply impressed by them?"
Rus couldn't stop laughing. He actually had to sit down on a nearby bench, shoulders shaking. "Oh my god. Have you been moping all this time because you're in love?"
"No. This can't be true. I knew from day one that person was unavailable. I wouldn't fall in love with them."
"Love is a cruel mistress. She doesn't listen to our wishes."
"That's not helpful."
Rus caught his breath and looked at Jay seriously. "Alright. Here's what we're going to do. Tonight, men's night out. I'll invite Mic and Van. We'll go to a pub. Nice and cosy, no survival games in the cold. Just drinks and love advice. What do you say?"
Jay agreed. He felt like he needed some perspective. He didn't want to sit in his barren apartment anyway.
They met that evening at eight at a designated pub, warm and dimly lit, with wooden booths and the smell of fried food. Mic and Van were already there, waving them over. They ordered beers. Jay made absolutely sure never to admit it was Ian. Rus would disapprove immediately since Ian was his boss. Instead, he kept it vague.
"So there's this coworker. An amazing person. A great mentor who gave me so much and made even the hardest moments bearable. I'm afraid of disappointing them and I feel unworthy to stand by their side. Also they're taken."
"Go for it. To hell if they're taken or not. Love is worth some transgressions," Mic said.
"That's terrible advice," Van countered immediately. "You should focus on fitness and work the love out of your system by sweating regularly. Ignore the person, continue the work, and focus all your free time on gains."
"Also terrible advice. You should find a new job and get some distance," Rus said.
"But do you think I'm actually in love?" Jay asked.
All three men answered simultaneously: "Yes."
"No one mopes for weeks and whines in bars over beers unless they're in love," Mic added.
Jay slumped in his seat. That didn't help at all.
They drank for a couple more hours, each man sharing their love stories. Some were quite comical. Mic was clearly a player, recounting elaborate schemes to impress various women, most of which had backfired spectacularly.
Van's stories mostly involved getting dumped for not spending enough time with his girlfriends. "She wanted flowers, outings. Who has time for it? I spend six days a week at the gym."
"I spend six days a week at work," Jay said.
Rus scoffed. "That's no way to live."
"Why not?" Van countered. "I understand the grind. As long as it's fulfilling, who cares?"
"I was actually married once," Rus admitted. "Divorced still in my twenties. We were military spouses. That often ends poorly. Dated a couple times afterwards, but it always fizzled out."
"So we're all four hopeless bachelors with obviously poor luck in love," Mic said, raising his glass. "Cheers to that."
They clinked glasses.
"My college girlfriend dumped me for not being adventurous enough," Jay said.
Van nodded solemnly. "Women are unreasonable."
"Or maybe we're just terrible at relationships," Rus added.
"Equally possible," Mic agreed.
Jay laughed, feeling slightly lighter.
"What do you guys do when you fail badly at something?" Jay asked after another round. "I cope poorly."
The men were all quite drunk by this point. Van said immediately, "I never fail."
Rus rolled his eyes. "When I got divorced, I moped for months. But finally life goes on, you know? You just keep putting one foot in front of the other."
Mic shrugged. "I fail about three times a week. It used to bother me, but now I'm used to it. You just need more practice at failing."
"That's actually profound," Jay said.
"Don't let it go to my head."
They kept drinking and complaining about various ailments—sore muscles, jobs, the price of rent, the quality of beer these days. Eventually Jay called it a night around midnight. All three insisted on walking him home. When they reached his building, Jay somehow ended up inviting them in.
They saw the sorry state of his apartment—boxes everywhere, bare shelves, the atmosphere of abandonment—and were suddenly more understanding.
"This is depressing," Mic said.
"No wonder you've been moping," Van added.
"It's no way to live," Rus concluded.
Jay produced the bottle of whiskey still left from his Christmas company basket. They were very impressed.
"This is good stuff," Mic said reverently.
So they stayed to drink more. Someone started singing. Then they were all singing, terrible drunken renditions of old songs, laughing and stumbling over lyrics.
At one in the morning, there was a polite knock on the door.
Jay opened it to find a weary police officer. "We've received a noise complaint. Will you keep it down?"
"Yes. Absolutely. I'm so sorry."
"Have a good night."
The door closed, and everyone scattered shortly after. Jay stood in his apartment, now utterly silent except for the ringing in his ears. He'd never been more humiliated in his life. He stumbled to bed without cleaning up, fell asleep immediately, and woke the next morning with a pounding headache.
He groaned heavily. These days, whenever he woke up hungover, there was Ian around with water and painkillers. This time he was alone and had to find water on his own. He was glad he'd left part of the medicine cabinet unpacked in the bathroom together with basic toiletries. He swallowed the pill and drank three glasses of water.
It was much more bearable when Ian had been around to comfort him. Ian always knew exactly what to do—the perfect balance of care and support.
Jay sighed and thought about the conversations from the night before. His friends were wrong. They didn't know the circumstances and he'd told the story poorly, so they misunderstood and misjudged.
He wasn't in love with Ian.
But that didn't change the fact that he didn't want to live without him.
The longer he thought about it, the more convinced he became that he couldn't leave. Staying would be hard and there would be moments when he'd suffer. He'd just take Mic's advice and get used to failures. It would surely get easier with time.
If that was the price for staying with Ian, he'd pay it.
He wasn't worthy to stay at Ian's side, but he still wanted to stay. He'd struggle and get hurt, but he'd still do his best to endure for as long as he was able. He'd find a way to cope, to manage, to become strong enough to deserve his place.
He didn't have to be perfect right away. He just had to stop being so obviously fragile that everyone noticed. He could do that. He would do that.
Chapter 33: What's worth fighting for
Scene 1
Resolve
Monday morning Jay went to work and his resolve was immediately tested.
He'd decided to stay. But standing outside the office building, watching the early light reflect off the glass, he still had doubts.
He arrived at eight to find half the team already there. Some looked like they hadn't left since Sunday. The air smelled stale—old coffee, takeout containers, and unwashed bodies. Luc was inside a sleeping bag in the corner, growling something unintelligible.
The scene was disheartening.
"Morning," Jay said weakly.
Luc made a sound that might have been a greeting or possibly a threat. He extracted himself from the sleeping bag with the grace of a dying animal and stumbled toward the coffee machine.
This was what Jay was signing up for by staying. Unreasonable working hours and incredible stress. People literally living at their desks, sacrificing everything for deadlines that never seemed to ease.
He battled with himself the whole day, stealing glances at Ian's office. Even Ian looked poorly. He was wearing a shirt with a missing button, his tie and jacket gone, hair ruffled. He'd clearly stayed in the office all weekend.
When their eyes met, Ian's expression was complicated. He sent a smile that was supposed to be reassuring but looked more like a grimace of misery.
Jay felt awkward being the only well-rested person in the office. But he quickly started working and the day moved forward. He stayed until ten that evening, shuffling materials, refilling everyone's coffees, delivering snacks. More moral support than anything else.
Tuesday wasn't much better. Jay had seen long days and weekend work before, but never had people literally lived in the office for days on end. The situation felt unsustainable, like watching a building collapse in slow motion.
Around noon, his phone rang. Jay stepped into a free conference room and answered.
"Mr. Hall? This is Meg from Accord Financial Services. We'd like to invite you for a second interview with our senior management."
Jay was reluctant. But he looked through the conference room glass at the disaster unfolding in the main office and heard himself say, "When would work for you?"
"Thursday afternoon? Say, four-thirty?"
"I'll be there."
He went to Ian as soon as he found an opportunity. "I need to leave at four on Thursday."
Ian's brows furrowed. He nodded without asking why, then returned to the document in front of him.
The phone call. The early leave. It all pointed to another interview. Or perhaps Jay had scored a second interview from whatever first interview he'd attended last week.
Why wouldn't he? Jay was competent, presentable. A candidate any reasonable company would want.
Ian gritted his teeth, feeling the ground leave beneath his feet. He'd hoped he had more time. But what if Jay got the job? What if Ian wouldn't even have the chance to set things right, would just watch as everything crumbled?
When Jay left for the gym at five that day, Ian looked up. Their eyes met through the glass wall. Jay could swear Ian was on the verge of tears—an expression of such raw pain that it stopped Jay in his tracks.
He'd known this was a bad time. He hadn't expected things were quite so serious.
Jay went to the gym with a heavy heart.
Rus was cheerful. "What are you still moping about?"
"I'm not moping. Just thinking things through thoroughly."
"And?"
"I think I'll stay. But I'm scared. Things are not good at work right now. Luc has been in a sleeping bag on the floor for five days without leaving the office at all."
"That's worse than my worst memories from the military. Maybe I misjudged how miserable my time there was. Perhaps the real struggle happens in finance."
"It was never so bad before. But we acquired a new very prestigious and demanding client recently. The workload increased while the team stayed the same size. Hence the constant drama at crucial moments."
"That's just bad management."
Jay immediately got defensive. "It's not. It's just that the work is difficult."
"If people are sleeping on the floor for days, that's bad management."
"You don't understand the industry."
Rus raised his hands. "Alright, alright. I won't criticize your beloved workplace."
Jay returned home and thought some more. He pulled out the apartment contract again, checking the bank conditions for the mortgage. If he decided to stay, he'd take the apartment. He'd move. Staying in his studio filled with boxes was only adding to his depression.
One way or another, he'd have to make a decision soon.
For now, he'd go for the interview on Thursday. He'd go straight from work and see how it went, how it felt. He wasn't sure what he'd do if he got the offer. But he'd have to actually get the offer before he could make any plans.
Maybe the decision would be taken out of his hands. If he didn't get the job, he'd consider it the will of the universe and stay. If he did get the job—then he'd have to decide on his own what to do.
Wednesday Jay stayed late again, almost until midnight. Half the team now lived in the office permanently. Only Kim, Max, and Amy left at reasonable hours. Kim because he didn't really need to stay. Max and Amy because they wanted to at least see their children every now and then.
Luc, Zoe, and Ela had essentially moved in. And so had Ian.
Someone had brought Ian fresh clothes, but he still didn't look well. Jay discreetly refilled his beverages and made sure he actually ate, trying to be unobtrusive about it.
Ian looked at him with an expression so pained, it was as if he was being tortured.
Jay approached during a quiet moment and whispered, "You've got this."
But somehow this seemed to have the opposite effect. Ian's face crumpled for just a moment before he composed himself.
"Excuse me," Ian said, standing abruptly and heading toward the bathroom.
Jay stood there holding the coffee, hoping he hadn't made some blunder. Seeing Ian like this was hard. This job was hard and he was weak and scared.
But he still wanted to stay by Ian's side.
He left the coffee on Ian's desk and returned to his own work. Through the glass wall, he could see the bathroom door remained closed for a long time.
When Ian finally emerged, his face was composed again, but his eyes were red.
Jay returned to his desk and tried to focus on work. Around him, the office was in chaos. Zoe typed furiously, eyes red from staring at her screen too long. Luc was in his sleeping bag, eating something from a takeout container while reviewing documents.
This was the reality of staying. Not the glamorous parts—the international trips, the Christmas celebrations, the evenings with Ian. But this: the grinding, exhausting work that demanded everything.
Jay wasn't sure he was strong enough for it.
But the alternative—leaving, never seeing Ian again—felt worse than any amount of stress or fear or exhaustion. He'd find a way to be strong enough. He had to.
Jay stayed until midnight, then took the metro home. He fell into bed fully clothed, too tired to shower.
Scene 2
Business district
Jay came to work Thursday morning as if nothing changed.
The deadline for strategy submission was tomorrow. Only finishing touches were being applied now, last checks made. Everyone was working on fumes, already feeling the finish line.
Luc had finally showered. Ela had put on fresh makeup. Zoe looked almost human again.
Ian was still in his office, bent over his laptop, but the tension in his shoulders had eased slightly. The worst was almost over.
The atmosphere was strained but different from previous weeks. There was light at the end of the tunnel. Exhaustion was mixed with relief.
At four, Jay packed his bag and left.
He took a taxi to the business district. It wasn't a long drive. He arrived with ten minutes to spare for his four-thirty interview.
He was wearing his regular office suit, his watch, his leather bag. He hadn't bothered to try and present an image anymore. If they had a problem with his appearance, that would tell him something important about whether he wanted to work there.
He surveyed the building and the area critically. It wouldn't be a bad place to work. Better than his previous workplace, at least. That building had been dingy, filled with a persistent smell of old coffee. This building was modern, clean. Not impressive, but solid.
The interview started punctually.
There was no one else in the lobby this time. Jay was led directly to a conference room where three people waited.
"Mr. Hall, thank you for coming. I'm Dan Miller, senior partner. This is Liu Serrano, operations director, and Mos Parker, head of client services."
"Pleased to meet you," Jay said.
They shook hands and sat down.
"We were very impressed with your first interview. Meg spoke highly of you."
"Thank you."
"So, tell us a bit about your current position. What does a typical day look like for you?"
Jay described his work. The reports he prepared. The meetings he attended. The clients he occasionally interfaced with.
They listened attentively, asking follow-up questions here and there.
Liu laughed at one point. "Sounds like you're doing the work of three people."
"It can feel that way sometimes," Jay admitted.
"That's finance for you. Always demanding the impossible and then acting surprised when people burn out," Dan said.
"We try to maintain better customs here. Work-life balance, all that. Not always successful, but we do try," Mos added.
"That sounds nice," Jay said.
"Have you been in the industry long?" Sandra asked.
"A little over a year at my current position. Before that, I worked at smaller firms."
"And what made you consider leaving your current role?"
"I wanted to explore other opportunities. Turner & Associates focuses primarily on high-level investment strategy. I'd like to work more directly with operational finance."
It wasn't a lie. It just wasn't the whole truth.
They moved on to salary negotiations. The number they offered was reasonable. Not as high as what he made now, but livable. Comfortable, even.
"When could you start, assuming we move forward?" Dan asked.
"I'd need two weeks. That's what my contract states."
"Perfectly reasonable."
The conversation drifted into chitchat after that. They talked about the realities and challenges of finance. They joked about the impossible clients, the regulatory changes, the eternal struggle to balance accuracy with deadlines.
Jay was relaxed. He'd attended so many meetings and negotiations already that this didn't faze him. He didn't try to make a good impression, but he also didn't try to sabotage himself. He acted as natural as he could, given the circumstances.
The entire meeting lasted half an hour, and most of it was spent on small talk. Jay suspected they were mostly trying to get a feel of him as a person, and not check his qualifications.
"Well, Mr. Hall, thank you for your time. We'll be in touch soon."
"Thank you for the opportunity."
They shook hands again, and Jay left.
He departed in a complicated mood.
He couldn't say how the interview went. It had felt easy, almost casual. Maybe too casual. Maybe that was good. He didn't know.
But with each passing day, he was more and more convinced that he wanted to stay.
The sting of his failures had begun to fade. He looked back at himself falling apart with shame. But at the same time, he understood that just because he was feeling better now meant nothing. He was sure to fail again, to feel that overwhelming misery again. That was what he was so poorly equipped to endure. He'd crash again, maybe harder next time, until something broke irreparably.
He walked around the neighborhood for a bit.
He rarely visited the business district. His previous jobs had been located elsewhere. It was modern, with functional buildings that were neither inspiring nor offensive. There were no impressive skyscrapers like the ones he was used to, but the area was well taken care of. Good public transport access. A decent place.
He found a restaurant for dinner. It was filled with local employees, tired people in department store suits who talked animatedly, mostly complaining about their work.
Such a stark image compared to the financial district's lively crowds discussing deals and international clients.
Jay ordered a meal and ate, watching the people around him. They looked content. No one was on the verge of collapse. No one looked like they'd been living in the office for five days.
He paid and left. On his way to the metro, Jay sighed deeply.
He wouldn't mind replacing the skyscrapers and distinguished colleagues for a down-to-earth working crowd. It was Ian he was unwilling to give up.
He had to at least try, didn't he? To fight for the best thing that ever happened to him. He'd never forgive himself if he gave it up due to his own weakness.
The metro ride home was quiet. Jay stared out the window at the passing lights, thinking about tomorrow. The deadline. The relief that would come after. Ian's face when the worst was finally over. He wanted to be there for that moment. He wanted to be there for all the moments after.
Scene 3
Battleground
Finally, it was Friday. The day strategy got submitted.
Everyone was doing one last sweep through documents, presentations, graphs, and spreadsheets. Searching for typos, checking calculations, verifying that every number matched across all materials. The entire office was filled with barely functioning zombies in mismatched clothes.
Only Kim and Jay looked presentable. It seemed Kim had taken on clothes duty, traveling to everyone's houses to collect essentials. But it was painfully clear which team members hadn't left the building in days. Luc wore the same shirt since Wednesday. Ela had given up on coordinating anything. Zoe's sweater was inside out.
Ian was deathly pale. Jay hadn't seen him eat anything that day, only endless cups of coffee. The smell of cigarettes clung to him so strongly Jay could swear Ian was smoking in his executive bathroom, but he didn't comment and didn't try to push him to eat.
There would be time to take care of that later. For now, Ian was hanging on by a thread, and Jay didn't want to yank at it. One more task. Just one more, and then this nightmare period would be over.
As two o'clock approached, Ian reviewed the final documents with red-rimmed eyes. Jay watched through the glass wall, concerned.
At exactly two-fifteen, Ian submitted the files. The strategy documents were officially delivered.
The collective breath of relief was audible throughout the office. People sagged in their chairs. Someone laughed, the sound slightly hysterical.
"We did it. We actually did it," Amy said weakly.
"I'm never doing this again. Next year I'm calling in sick for all of February," Ela declared.
Celebrations started, as subdued as they were from an exhausted crowd. A few people hugged. 
Jay's phone rang.
He glanced at the screen. Unknown number. He got up and moved to the closest conference room—currently unoccupied, with glass walls that looked out over the main office.
Ian watched him go. Watched him answer the call. Watched him smile and nod to whoever he was talking to.
The sinking feeling in Ian's stomach almost toppled him.
That was it, then. A job offer. It had to be. The timing, the smile, the way Jay's posture straightened slightly. Someone was offering him something, and Jay was accepting it.
Ian was out of time.
He stood abruptly, his chair scraping loudly. His voice came out strained when he addressed the team. "Everyone go home. Get rest."
Then he fled to the bathroom before anyone could respond.
In the conference room, Jay finished his conversation. "Thank you so much for the offer. I'm very flattered. Unfortunately, I've received another opportunity that I've decided to accept. I apologize for any inconvenience... Yes, I understand. Thank you for your time and consideration."
He hung up and stood for a moment, staring at his phone. He'd turned down the job. He was staying. Now he just had to prove he deserved to.
When Jay left the conference room, everyone was sluggishly packing and departing. Kim was escorting Ela out, one arm around her shoulders to keep her upright. Zoe was already packed and moving toward the exit. Luc struggled with rolling up his sleeping bag, cursing under his breath.
"Where's Ian?" Jay asked.
"Probably already went home to collapse," Luc said without looking up. "Everyone else is on their way too."
He barely spoke besides that, looking very worn out. Jay didn't push for more conversation.
Jay slowly packed his things but stayed after everyone else departed. The office looked like a battleground. Papers scattered across desks, empty coffee cups forming small graveyards in corners, someone's shoes abandoned under a table. The cleaning crews had been instructed to avoid the space until given clearance, lest they move important documents. They'd only come now to deal with the aftermath.
He looked toward Ian's office, where everything was left as it was. Documents still spread across the desk, the chair pushed back at an angle, Ian's coat still hanging on the rack.
Jay hoped Ian was alright. He certainly hadn't looked alright.
Jay sighed and took one more look around. He'd received a job offer, and judging by how quickly the call came, they'd been quite happy with him. He'd made an apologetic speech about receiving a better offer in the meantime, which was a thin excuse since he'd interviewed just yesterday, but he'd tried to sound convincing.
He surveyed the place where he'd chosen to stay. It decidedly didn't look inviting at the moment—more like a disaster zone than a prestigious workplace. But he still smiled.
It wasn't really the office or the work he was staying for. Frankly, the work was terrifying. The pressure, the stakes, the constant possibility of failure. But one last look toward Ian's desk as he headed for the exit convinced him he'd made the right choice.
Things that are worth it in life are rarely easy.
Ian, meanwhile, was stuck in the bathroom. He leaned against the sink, gripping the porcelain edge hard enough that his knuckles went white. He was exhausted to the point of breaking, and the sight of Jay cheerfully taking what he'd interpreted as a job offer felt like a nail in a coffin.
He'd failed. He run out of time. He spent weeks watching Jay slip away while being too consumed by work to do anything about it, and now it was too late.
Except it couldn't be too late. Ian refused to accept that.
It took him an unreasonably long time to collect himself enough to even think about returning home. He splashed cold water on his face, avoiding his reflection in the mirror. He looked terrible and he knew it.
He had the weekend to rest, recuperate, and be in the best form possible for Monday. He couldn't delay it a day longer.
On Monday, he had to convince Jay to stay. He had to find the right words, the right approach to communicate what Jay meant to him without crossing any lines.
Ian didn't know how he'd do it, but he knew he had to.
He finally left the bathroom and made his way to the elevator. The office was empty now, everyone gone. Just him and the silence and the weight of his failures.
Scene 4
Promotion
The weekend passed very differently for both men.
Jay went to the gym Saturday, his body enjoying the activity after weeks of neglect. He relaxed, did chores, caught up on sleep. On Sunday he traveled to the new apartment district and spent the entire day walking around the neighborhood.
The weather had calmed recently. The river looked much less menacing, even if the water level was still high. The area was beautiful, even in gloomy winter weather. The Sunday crowds were stylish—couples strolling hand in hand, families with expensive strollers, elegant ladies walking designer dogs.
Jay didn't feel any connection with these people, but he didn't have any bad feelings about them either. His previous dread was gone. For now, at least, he felt ready.
Ian, meanwhile, slept all Saturday. The exhaustion had accumulated to dangerous levels, and his body demanded rest. He only took breaks for proper meals, forcing himself to eat slowly and mindfully.
On Sunday he worked out intensively. The last couple of weeks had wrecked his form and it would take time to recover, but the movement cleared his head. He exercised, ate well, and planned his Monday meeting with Jay.
He rehearsed his lines in front of a mirror like he was preparing for a major negotiation. And it felt like the most major one in his life. Every word had to be perfect. Every approach analysed from all angles.
He went to bed early. He needed to be in top shape.
When Jay arrived at work Monday at seven-thirty, Ian was already there. In Jay's mailbox sat two emails. The first congratulated the team for successfully delivering the strategy, promising a dedicated meeting later that week about the aftermath. The second invited him for his delayed performance review.
Jay hadn't expected it. He hadn't prepared himself for it. He thought to himself that it would be funny if he actually got fired on the next workday after rejecting a job offer, and wondered if maybe they'd still hire him.
But he wasn't really nervous. He knew Ian. Ian wasn't someone who would surprise an employee with termination without prior notice.
The review was scheduled for nine. Jay entered Ian's office, closed the door behind him, and sat in the chair across from the desk. Ian still looked pale, still seemed worn out, but his clothes and hair were immaculate and he'd regained his former composure. Back straight, hands folded, expression controlled.
Ian started speaking in a very diplomatic way, praising Jay's contributions and work ethic, his ability to manage multiple priorities.
Then he apologized for the recent stressful period. He wasn't obsequious about it, but it was a very heartfelt apology. He took the blame for the pressure and everything that resulted from that pressure, assuring Jay that things would change for the better.
"While busy periods are normal in this industry, what happened these past couple of months was a failure of leadership on my part. I will remedy that."
Jay was surprised by that display. "It's quite alright. Everyone understands—"
"It's clearly not alright. Everyone can see it. This isn't even a matter of compensation for overtime, though that will naturally be addressed as well. It's a matter of putting undue strain on people."
Jay didn't know what to say. It was as Rus had said—bad management. But he absolutely refused to admit Ian was a bad manager.
Ian's tone lightened slightly. "While it was my failure and I admit it openly, I'll also ensure this gets fixed. I won't let my mistakes define me."
Jay smiled at that, recognizing Ian was likely addressing his own past errors, showing that there was no point dwelling and casting blame, but he needed to look forward. "That's a very wise approach."
Ian paused for a moment, gathering himself. "Do you have anything to add from yourself?"
This was the moment. If Jay wanted to hand in his resignation, this was probably it. Ian braced himself.
But Jay just smiled and shook his head. "No. I think you've covered everything."
Ian didn't address it directly, but his mind was already running recalculations. Maybe Jay had rejected the offer after all. Perhaps it wasn't very enticing. That gave him some leeway, but he still needed to be decisive.
He pushed a folder across the desk. "Your new contract."
Jay opened it and started reading. His previous contract had been standard—three years with a two-week termination period. This was permanent, with a three-month termination period. You didn't get a permanent contract until you'd worked somewhere for three years. Not unprecedented, but unusual to get it so early.
Then he saw the salary. A forty-five percent pay rise. Twenty thousand monthly. That was... obscene.
He kept reading. Additional vacation days. A company car if he chose to get it. An extended benefits package normally reserved for executives, apparently courtesy of the CFO position. More freedom in task assignments. A title change from assistant to coordinator.
That was excessive.
He read the contract twice, in silence, shuffling through the pages listing benefits. He looked at Ian, then back at the pages. Then he laid the contract down.
"This seems a bit over the top."
"It seemed appropriate. You do much more than assistant duties. Your position and compensation should at least reflect that."
"I can't possibly accept this."
Ian clenched his jaw hard. He spoke softly and quietly, putting attention into every word. "I can offer you another position if these conditions are not satisfactory. You could be moved to the regular team. Or switch departments, if you feel you need a change."
"I like being your assistant. I want to stay in the role."
Ian looked doubtful. "Are you certain?"
"Yes."
"Then you'll stay in your current role. Just your title will change to better reflect the duties you already cover. Assistants don't support regular team members in their standard assignments, after all."
Jay was still unconvinced. "The pay is unreasonable."
Ian smiled bitterly. "You'd still earn the least out of the whole team. While your duties are equally strenuous."
Jay sat for a moment and looked down at the contract again. Then at Ian, sitting there with his perfectly controlled expression. Hands still. Breathing even. Back ramrod straight.
Something unsettled Jay about it.
"I thought I was going to get fired," Jay said, half-joking.
"I would never fire you," Ian said very solemnly. "I apologize once again if the impression I made was one of displeasure. The period was stressful for everyone and I coped poorly."
"Yeah, you and me both," Jay said, which got a real smile from Ian for once.
Jay sighed and took his pen out. He signed both copies and gave one to Ian. Only then did Ian visibly relax, his shoulders dropping slightly, his breathing deepening.
"It seems I'm going to move after all. I really don't have any more reasons to delay it, and my boxes are all packed anyway."
Ian immediately recommended a moving service. "I can have the arrangements made today if you'd like."
"That's not going to be necessary. I don't have nearly that many belongings. I'll just get my buddies to help me. They owe me anyway."
"Oh?"
"They came over and were so loud the police were called, then left me alone to deal with it. Some friends."
Ian actually laughed, and the atmosphere finally relaxed. With that, Jay left.
He looked at his new contract blankly as he sat at his desk. It seemed he really did get a much better offer, just as he'd told the interviewer on Friday. But it felt suspicious. Ian's stress levels were obviously off the charts. He needed to at least try to remedy it.
Jay went to the kitchen and prepared a warming herbal tea with root spices. He brought it to Ian's office and set it down on the desk.
Ian looked at him strangely. "You don't need to serve me refreshments."
"My new contract included more freedom in tasks," Jay said innocently.
Ian sighed. "Thank you."
Jay returned to his desk grinning.
It seemed like at least something had been resolved favorably.
Scene 5
Mental fortitude
The following workdays were still busy. Occasional client inquiries about the strategy had to be addressed, and normal work that had been severely neglected needed catching up. But the long hours ceased for most of the team.
Max and Amy stayed late most days. The people who'd camped in the office left like clockwork at five, traumatized by the idea of overtime. Ela practically ran for the exit. Luc set an alarm on his phone and departed the instant it rang.
Jay stayed late as well, accompanying Ian. He watched attentively to make sure Ian returned to normal eating habits and stopped secretly smoking.
"You're hovering," Ian said Monday evening, looking up from his documents.
"I'm observing."
"You're monitoring my every move like I'm a flight risk."
"Are you eating properly?"
Ian sighed. "Yes."
"You look less pale than last week, I'll give you that."
Ian rolled his eyes overtly, but secretly he was overjoyed. The crisis seemed averted. But he couldn't get complacent. It was his fault the crisis had appeared in the first place. He needed to be more mindful, more proactive.
On Tuesday, Jay left for the gym. 
"So? What happened with the job stuff?" Rus asked.
"I'm keeping my current position. And proceeding with the apartment purchase."
Rus stopped mid-stretch. "You're kidding."
"I'm not."
"That's a mistake."
"You've mentioned that."
"Because it's true! That place is going to kill you."
They moved to the weights. Rus continued nagging throughout the entire session. Jay let him, knowing Rus needed to voice his concerns even if Jay had no intention of taking the advice.
"I just need to get more used to failure," Jay said between sets.
"That's literally the worst life philosophy I've ever heard. Did Mic tell you that? Because he's the worst person to take advice from."
But Jay was already certain of his decision. The fear hadn't disappeared entirely, but it had become manageable. Something he could live with.
That evening, Jay called the agent. "Is the flat still available?"
"Very much so!" The agent sounded relieved. "Has your money situation been resolved?"
Jay cringed, remembering his lost envelope. "It hasn't. But I thought more about it and decided I like the flat enough to make some sacrifices."
"Excellent! I'll come collect the contract right away and we can proceed with the purchase."
"That's not necessary. I can come to your office—"
"I insist. I'll be there within the hour."
Jay tried to protest, but the agent was unrelenting. True to his word, he arrived exactly fifty-three minutes later.
He was delighted when he saw Jay was already packed into boxes. "Perfect! This will make everything much easier. I'll proceed as promptly as possible."
Jay was once again suspicious about the man's enthusiasm, but maybe being a real estate agent required that level of energy.
On Wednesday, Ian announced a team meeting. Everyone gathered in the conference room.
"First, thank you all again for your extraordinary work during the strategy period. I want to apologize for the strain it placed on everyone. To address this, I'm offering additional vacation days, an additional bonus at the end of the month, and spa vouchers for everyone to get proper relaxing massages."
There were murmurs of appreciation. Ela smiled.
"Additionally, we'll be hiring new team members. Leo is already proceeding with preliminary CV collection and setting up first interviews with HR. I'll start interviewing candidates in April, after quarterly reports are complete. Hopefully we can hire people by May so they can join the company retreat and better integrate into the team. I'm thinking two to four people, possibly five if we find the right candidates."
The room went quiet. Everyone exchanged glances.
After the meeting, Jay approached Luc. "Why does everyone seem shocked about hiring?"
"Because Ian hates hiring. He's notoriously picky. Impossibly high standards plus very specific particularities. It's a nightmare process."
"He can't be that picky if he chose to keep me," Jay joked.
Amy, overhearing, rolled her eyes. "You're a rare and precious gem. The result of years of Leo's unsuccessful headhunting attempts."
Jay blushed and returned to his desk feeling sheepish. He'd heard stories about Ian being very demanding, which he'd concluded were grossly overblown. Ian was nothing but kind, fair, and generous.
The work itself was difficult and required endurance, he had to admit. It wasn't long ago when he'd been on the verge of breaking, and his position was hardly crucial. He could imagine it required great mental fortitude to be a regular team member.
It seemed the office would get more lively in coming months. There were six free desks in the main office and another one next to Jay. They could comfortably fit seven more people.
Apparently it had taken a long time for Ian to gather his current team, and many people had been fired along the way for failing to meet his exacting standards. Jay was curious to see exactly what qualities Ian looked for in subordinates.
This period brought another curious development. Every now and then, Jay would receive a call from some HR department offering an interview. His inbox would occasionally produce similar emails.
He politely answered all of them, informing each that he'd already secured another position. The awkwardness increased with each one as he had to scuttle to a free conference room or occasionally to the bathroom to take the calls.
"I appreciate the offer, but I've already accepted another position," he said into his phone Thursday afternoon, hiding in a conference room. "Yes, I understand. Thank you for considering me. I apologize for any inconvenience."
Ian watched from his office, first with concern, then with growing amusement as he overheard Jay's fervent apologies to the unfortunate HR people. Exactly how many applications had Jay sent?
Ian wanted to comment but reminded himself not to be too forward. He had to tread carefully. He didn't want to make Jay uncomfortable.
Jay was surprised they were reaching out with such delay. He'd initially thought no one was interested, but it seemed it took companies quite some time to process applications and reach out to candidates. And he wasn't as unpopular as he'd initially thought.
Chapter 34: Damp weather
Scene 1
Warming soup
Team members took turns taking time off to recuperate before the next busy periods. The office was missing one or two people constantly. Jay expressed no desire to join them. Strategy season hadn't been nearly as bad for him as for the others, despite his mishap with the database. He'd survived. They needed the rest more.
Ian continued working twelve-hour days, but he returned to normal, his face recovering its glow. The dark circles faded. The tension in his shoulders eased. Jay watched it with relief.
March was ending, but the weather remained poor. Rain battered the windows most mornings, and the sky hung gray and heavy through the afternoons. However, with the immediate crisis temporarily resolved, the team returned to their daily lunch outings. Weather grumbling was constant but less pronounced. Everyone was glad to leave the office.
"It's supposed to rain until April," Kim announced Monday afternoon, scrolling through his phone.
"Fantastic. I love perpetual dampness," Ela muttered.
"We could eat at our desks," Amy said without enthusiasm.
"Absolutely not. We earned our lunches out. Weather be damned," Luc said firmly.
Jay used the first opportunity that presented itself to push for his favourite. "What about Willow & Sage?"
"That little place with the soup?" Zoe asked.
"Yes. I haven't been there in months."
"Tragic existence," Luc joked.
"Then Willow & Sage it is," Amy decided.
They went that afternoon, crowding through the door and shaking rain from their coats. The warm, cosy atmosphere immediately lifted Jay's spirits. Rough wooden tables, soft lighting, herbs hanging in bunches from exposed beams. The smell of bread and simmering stock. He'd missed this place.
They sat at a long table near the back. Jay ordered warming soup with herbal bread. The exact meal he'd been craving for weeks.
He hunched in the corner with Zoe and Luc, listening to Zoe describe her weekend hiking trip with good-natured enthusiasm. Luc looked better than he had in weeks, colour returned to his face, energy restored.
"It was a great success despite the miserable weather. Being able to finally walk around instead of constantly sitting at a desk was brilliant," Zoe said.
The food arrived. Jay took his first spoonful of soup and closed his eyes briefly. Perfect. Rich and earthy with just enough salt.
"You look like you're having a religious experience," Luc observed.
"Maybe I am."
Luc watched him for another moment, then set down his fork. "So what was bothering you so much lately?"
The table went quiet. Jay opened his eyes.
"We were the ones living in the office. But you were the one who looked like you were being actively tortured."
Jay grew quiet. He tore off a piece of bread, focusing on it. "Personal matters."
"Personal matters," Kim repeated with great cheerfulness. "Are you sure it wasn't still the dropped table matter? Because that was honestly hilarious. The look on your face when you realized—"
"It wasn't that. And I don't want to talk about it. But I appreciate your concern, even if you're terribly insensitive about it."
Kim grinned. "Fair."
"We're not trying to pry," Amy said more gently. "You just seemed… different. For a while."
"I'm fine now," Jay said. "Really."
"If you're sure."
"I'm sure."
The conversation moved on. Jay focused on his soup, letting the warmth seep through him. The bread was dense and fragrant with rosemary. Each bite pushed back the unpleasant memories of the lost envelope, the months of saving gone in a moment of carelessness. He definitely didn't want to publicly admit to that blunder. Some failures were too mortifying to share.
By the time they returned to the office, the rain had intensified into a proper downpour. They arrived soaked, dripping puddles onto the marble floor.
Jay returned to his desk and opened his email. Another message from HR about the May retreat. He accepted the invite and clicked through to the signup sheet.
The activity list was extensive. Horseback riding. Archery. Pottery. Dancing. Kayaking. Cooking classes. Hiking trails. Paddle boats.
Nothing as adventurous as horseback archery, but the hike seemed comfortable enough. He selected it. Cooking classes could be interesting. He added those as well. Paddle boats sounded fun. He picked that too.
He was scrolling through the remaining options when Ian emerged from his office. He approached Jay's desk, glancing at the screen.
"Did you choose the boats?" Ian asked.
Jay looked up. "Yes. Just now."
"I'm quite fond of those."
"Can we be on the same boat then?"
"Naturally. I'll make arrangements."
"Thank you."
Though Ian thought to himself he probably wouldn't need to. Leo would make sure they got grouped in everything.
Ian returned to his office. Jay turned back to his screen, excitement building. Spending time doing fun things with Ian again. Just a couple of weeks ago he'd given up on this life entirely. Now he had something to look forward to.
He scrolled through the signup sheet one more time, confirming his selections. He could imagine Ian on the boat, hair catching the wind. Or hiking together through the woods. Cooking side by side in the lodge kitchen like they had at Christmas.
Jay agreed with Kim that separate room were a downgrade. The morning coffee with Ian while they were both still in their respective beds was the best. He caught himself at this thought and blushed furiously. What was he even thinking? Fay's diagnosis echoed in his mind: head over heels in love.
Preposterous. He just wanted to hang out with someone he admired. That was a perfectly normal friendly wish. Nothing more complicated than that.
He closed the signup form and returned to his spreadsheets, determinedly ignoring the way his pulse had quickened at the thought of sharing a boat with Ian. Just friends. Colleagues. Nothing strange about looking forward to activities with a person you respected.
The rain continued outside. Jay worked through the afternoon, occasionally glancing toward Ian's office with fondness. Completely nothing weird about that at all.
Scene 2
Submitting the paperwork
As April loomed, Jay wanted to get as many affairs in order before the next hectic period. He arranged the bank visit to sign the loan paperwork.
The bank accommodated his preferred time on Friday afternoon. Since he'd already provided all the details in the pre-approval stage, he just went to officially submit his application.
The bank lady was as helpful and friendly as the last time, giving him obviously preferential treatment. She helped him expediently with the paperwork. He had all the necessary documents ready, including property valuation conveniently delivered by the real estate agent.
"Excellent. The paperwork will be ready to sign in two weeks. Once you do, the money will be transferred within a couple of days," she said as she gathered the papers into a neat stack.
"Two weeks. So early April."
"Exactly. We'll call when everything is ready."
"Thank you."
The whole process took less than twenty minutes. Jay left the bank with feeling dizzy. It was really happening. He called the real estate agent from the street.
"Mr. Hall," the agent answered cheerfully. "How did it go?"
"Everything's submitted. They said two weeks for the paperwork, then a couple of days for the transfer."
"Perfect, perfect. I'll handle the notary work. Just let me know when the funds are confirmed, and we'll schedule the final signing."
"I will. Thank you."
"It's a beautiful property. You're making an excellent choice."
Jay ended the call and stood on the sidewalk for a moment. It was final then. In about three weeks, he'd move. Right in the middle of April, after Easter.
He hadn't canceled his lease yet. He had a three-month termination period, but wanted to be secure in the new place before he felt comfortable abandoning his current flat. And despite how gloomy it looked stacked with boxes, he was still very fond of it. Leaving still saddened him.
That evening, he called his mother.
"Jay?" She sounded surprised. "Is everything alright?"
"Everything's fine. I wanted to ask about Easter. Do you have plans?"
"Plans? No, we'll stay at home. Traditional dinner. Why?"
"I was thinking I could visit."
"Visit?" Her voice lifted with joy. "Really? Oh, that would be wonderful!"
In the background, Jay heard his youngest brother Ari's voice: "Is that Jay? Is he bringing gifts?"
Jay heard his mother's muffled response, then Ari yelled louder: "We'll send a wishlist!"
His mother laughed. "You heard."
"All you care about is gifts," Jay grumbled, but he wasn't really annoyed.
"They're young," his mother said warmly. "They miss you. We all do."
"I miss you too."
"Will you stay overnight?"
"I'd like that. I'll arrive on Saturday and leave Sunday afternoon. It's a long drive, after all."
"Of course, of course. I'm so happy you're coming."
Ari yelled something else in the background about chocolate.
"I'll bring something," Jay promised.
After they hung up, Jay felt lighter. It had been too long since he'd visited home. Work had consumed everything for months, but now that things had stabilized, he could finally take the trip.
He used the weekend to handle the shopping. On Saturday he went to a large grocery store, working through his mental list. Variety of sweets first—chocolate eggs, marshmallow candies, fruit jellies. He moved on to food. Since he was going to visit, he wanted to help cook. He filled his cart with groceries that had long shelf life. Olive oil. Hard cheese. Cured meats. Aged sausages. Variety of pastas. Canned vegetables. Things that could lay around for two weeks in his pantry without spoiling.
Then items from his siblings' texted wish list, which had arrived within an hour of his call. Then he tackled clothing. His storage problems were about to be mostly solved, so he could finally get some casual clothes. He went to one of the nice boutiques that had been recommended to him last year.
The shop was quiet when he entered. A young clerk approached immediately.
"Good afternoon. Can I help you find something?"
"I need casual jeans and shirts," Jay said.
"Of course. What's your size?"
Jay told him. The clerk nodded and began pulling items from displays and racks.
"Try these. And these shirts should work well. The colours suit you."
Jay took them to the fitting room. He was pleased to discover that shopping for clothes was no longer an excruciating ordeal. It was hardly pleasant, but definitely manageable. Last year he'd needed to prepare beforehand and write himself an itinerary. Now he at least simply entered the store and picked things that were most acceptable.
Ian's advice echoed in his mind: Find an expert, and do what they say.
He tried on the jeans first. The fit was good. The shirts were comfortable, soft cotton in muted colours. Blue, gray, dark green.
"How's everything?" the clerk called.
"Good. I'll take these."
He emerged from the fitting room with his selections. The clerk rang them up efficiently.
"Anything else you need?" he asked.
"No, this is fine. Thank you."
"Have a good day."
Jay left with his purchases, feeling accomplished. Tasks handled. Plans in motion. Everything falling into place.
He went to work on Monday in an uncommonly good mood—something rare for him lately. Ian was already there and looked up when Jay arrived.
"Good morning," Ian said.
"Good morning."
"You seem in better spirits."
"I am. I'm moving forward with the apartment and the mortgage. I'll probably move within a month. Now that the decision is final and the paperwork is submitted, I feel calmer about it. I'm no longer stressing about making the right choice."
"That's excellent news."
"And I'm visiting my family for Easter."
"That sounds nice."
"It's been too long. My youngest brother already demanded gifts."
"How old is he?"
"Thirteen. Still thinks I'm made of money."
"Younger siblings often do. You look much better than you used to in the past month."
Jay laughed. "The strategy season was hard on everyone, me included, even if I didn't have as much stake in it."
"I'll make sure it's easier next year. There are some promising candidates lined up. Leo actually put in the work on high-stakes headhunting. Their salaries are going to hurt, but it's better than having the whole team burn out and quit."
Jay returned to his desk, organizing his workspace for the day. April was going to be busy, but he felt ready for it.
Scene 3
Intentions
March ended and the hectic period of quarterly reporting began. The entire team returned to work to deal with the workload, the brief vacation period ending abruptly.
But before Jay could fully immerse himself in the work, a bank notification arrived with his salary. He opened it at his desk, expecting it to be higher, given the quarterly bonus, the strategy bonus, his new pay rise. But the number started him. Eighty thousand.
Four times his normal salary.
He stared at the screen, refreshing it twice to confirm. The number didn't change.
This time he went to accounting to confirm. He was comfortable enough with them now to simply ask. The accounting department occupied a corner on their floor, separated by frosted glass doors.
Jen looked up when he entered, her face brightening immediately. "Jay! What can I do for you?"
"I think there might be an error with my salary."
"An error? What's the issue?"
"It's… higher than expected."
She typed rapidly, scanning the screen. Then she smiled. "No error. Your new contract came into effect at the beginning of the year, so you received compensation for the difference."
"The difference," Jay repeated.
"Right. Your quarterly bonus is also based on your new salary, not the old one. That, plus the additional strategy bonus, gives you the result you saw."
"So it's correct."
"Completely correct. You look surprised."
"I am."
"You earned it." She turned back to her screen but kept talking. "So how have you been? It feels like forever since we've chatted. You're always so busy—"
"I should get back to work. The quarterly reports."
"Oh, of course. But we should grab coffee sometime—"
"Maybe. Thank you for clarifying."
He retreated quickly, returning to his desk. He looked at his balance once again on his phone. He was being paid obscenely well. It shouldn't shock him anymore, but it still did.
But the musings about money would have to wait. He returned to his assignments, opening the first file on his list.
The team braved the workload better this time. The processes concerning Hartwell, their newest and most demanding client, had been streamlined and weren't causing as many problems as previous seasons. The workload was still heavy, but nothing compared to what had happened in the past months.
Tuesday evening, Luc shut his laptop at ten o'clock and stood triumphantly.
"At least I don't need to camp out in the office," he chanted, grabbing his coat. "At least I don't need to camp out in the office."
"We're coming back Saturday," Kim pointed out.
"Still counts as going home."
Lunches got replaced with takeout again. Working until ten every evening became the norm. But the weather outside was still miserable, rain and gray skies constant, so staying in felt less like a punishment. And at least everyone could return home, even if they had to come in Saturday.
Jay already dreaded his next gym visit. Rus would definitely scold him for his job being unreasonable and for making a mistake by staying.
But Jay's mood was much better. He'd almost forgotten about the misery of his February blunders. Time and intense periods that followed took his mind off things. The increased workload didn't bother him. He was even glad for it.
Since the office was always busy recently—first with absences of people taking vacation days, requiring longer hours from the rest, now with everyone working hard on quarterly reports—he didn't have as much time to stay alone with Ian.
It wasn't that he didn't want to be in Ian's company. Quite the opposite. He appreciated and treasured it. But Fay's words about being in love kept randomly reappearing and making him flustered. It was ridiculous, naturally, but the idea didn't want to retire from his mind and kept popping up at random moments.
He didn't feel ready to spend prolonged time alone with Ian. What if he suddenly started blushing for no reason? That would just make everything unnecessarily awkward.
Wednesday afternoon, Ian emerged from his office to refill his coffee. Jay was at his desk, absorbed in a spreadsheet, one hand in his hair, the other clicking through cells.
Ian watched for a moment, then returned to his office without speaking. Better not to interrupt.
Ian had his own reservations. He was still beating himself up over his blunder of calling Jay beautiful. It was around that time that Jay started to withdraw. He was sure it was at least part of the reason.
Jay valued his peace and security above all. If he felt in any way threatened, he'd flee. Everything was going so well, and Ian had to ruin it by making Jay doubt his intentions.
His intentions were absolutely pure. Regardless of what he thought and felt about Jay, he would never make him uncomfortable. He would rather die than violate the trust they'd built. Jay needed to be absolutely certain of it.
But since Jay was still here, still showed care openly, the damage wasn't too serious. Ian could still rebuild what they had. Make Jay feel safe enough again for them to share those tender moments, just like they used to. He just needed to make sure to never make any more stupid mistakes.
He'd be slow about it, but he'd get the intimacy they shared back. He really didn't want anything more.
On Friday Amy caught an error in one of the summary reports that required two hours of backtracking. Max stayed until midnight helping her fix it. Kim cursed his computer system for freezing during a critical update.
Saturday was quieter, just half the team working through remaining items. By Monday afternoon, the last files got submitted.
The team erupted in cheers.
"Finally," Ela breathed, collapsing back in her chair.
Luc stood up. "We're getting drinks. Everyone. No excuses."
"I have plans—" Kim started.
"Cancel them."
"I don't actually have plans."
"Then you're coming."
Jay joined this time. He felt it was deserved. They'd struggled for months, and now finally they'd reached the finish line. Even Zoe was there.
They went to Murphy's, their favorite pub, crowding into a large booth near the back. The atmosphere was boisterous from the start, everyone vividly complaining about being put through hell.
"I barely slept," Ela said dramatically. "I aged ten years."
"You look the same," Max pointed out.
"That's kind, but I know I look terrible."
Jay ordered a beer, then another. The alcohol made everything slightly fuzzy and warm. He complained alongside everyone else.
"Database management is absolutely unfair," he announced to Kim, who was sitting across from him.
Kim's face lit up. "I knew it! I knew you were still depressed about the dropped table."
"It's a legitimate grievance."
"It was months ago."
"And I'm still bitter."
"Jay holding a grudge. Write this down, someone."
"I'm just pointing out that database management is poorly designed."
"Keep going. Tell me more."
"The restore process is needlessly complicated."
"Amazing."
Jay smiled to himself. His great mistake that had affected him so much was nothing more than an anecdote to tease him about over beer.
The evening continued. People ordered food. Conversations overlapped and blended together. Jay told a story about his youngest brother demanding gifts that had Zoe laughing. Kim and Luc argued about some technical specification.
By ten o'clock, people started leaving. Zoe left first, Kim and Ela followed shortly after.
Eventually only Jay and Luc remained.
"I should go," Jay said, checking his phone. "I have to get up early tomorrow."
"Overachiever," Luc muttered.
"Says the man who lives at the office."
"Not anymore. I'm a changed man."
Jay left. Outside, the rain had stopped. The streets were wet and reflective under the streetlights. Jay called a taxi and waited, hands in his pockets, looking up at the dark sky.
Scene 4
Denial
The atmosphere lightened as the quarterly reporting period ended. Overtime ended overnight, and everyone, Jay included, left at five for the remainder of the week. The beginning of April was still cold and damp, but the daily lunch outings returned enthusiastically.
Easter and the upcoming quarterly party dominated the conversations.
"Four days off. Four entire days," Ela said dreamily at Monday's lunch. 
"I'm sleeping for three of them," Luc announced.
"What about the fourth?"
"More sleeping."
On Tuesday at the gym, Jay cornered Rus by the weight rack.
"I need a favor."
"What kind of favor?"
"I need you and the guys to help me move. In a couple of weeks."
"Move? So you're actually doing it?"
"Yes. And you all owe me for that unfortunate incident where the police got called because you were too loud in my studio."
Rus had the decency to look sheepish. "That was one time."
"One time too many."
"Fine, fine. I'll get the guys to organize a van. When do you need us?"
"I'll let you know the exact date once everything's finalized. Probably mid-April."
"We'll be there. But I still think your job is unreasonable."
"I know you do."
"Working until ten every night for a week straight—"
"It was manageable this time."
"That doesn't make it reasonable."
"It's getting better."
At lunch on Wednesday, Jay made his announcement.
"I'm buying the apartment."
The table erupted.
"Finally!" Zoe said.
"Congratulations!" Amy reached across to pat his hand.
"About time. You've been agonizing over this for months," Max added.
Luc grumbled into his soup. "Insufficient space for entertaining, though."
"I'm not planning to entertain."
"That's what everyone says until they actually want to have people over."
"It has a balcony," Jay pointed out. 
"A balcony is not entertaining space." 
"It's better than what I have now." 
"Barely."
The topic moved to Easter plans. Everyone shared theirs—family dinners, short trips, lazy weekends at home.
"I'm visiting my family," Jay said.
"That's nice," Ela said. "How long has it been?"
"Too long." 
"What are you doing for Easter?" Zoe asked Luc.
"Enjoying myself. No girlfriend means no suffering through her family nagging me about my career prospects and when we're getting married."
"That's the spirit," Max said dryly.
Jay had already placed a request for the company car beforehand. He was picking it up that afternoon, since the next day was the party and the day after was already off for the holidays.
He collected it after work. The limousine was waiting in the garage, sleek and black and completely excessive. He was no longer surprised, just resigned.
He drove it home, acutely aware of every other vehicle on the road. When he arrived at his building, he parked right outside his window, where he could see it from his flat.
It's insured, he told himself. Safe area. Nothing will happen. He repeated this to himself several times but still felt nervous.
The next day was Thursday, the final day before Easter, and the quarterly party. Everyone left work promptly to have enough time to prepare.
Jay wore his original navy suit. It was the only appropriate evening attire he'd left unpacked. He arrived by taxi, scanned the venue, approved of the lavish setting, and, as tradition demanded, found the buffet.
This time the team looked in much better spirits. The worst was behind them. Everyone was looking forward to the warm season. Vacation plans were the main topic of the evening.
"What about you, Jay?" Amy asked. "Any plans?"
"Just making myself at home in the new apartment."
Everyone nodded and offered advice with various levels of usefulness.
"Get good curtains," Zoe said. "Light control is everything."
"Invest in a proper mattress," Max added. "Your back will thank you."
"Don't buy too much furniture at once," Kim said. "Live in the space first, see what you actually need."
Jay nodded along, but remembered none of it.
Later in the evening, he spotted Luc at the bar, leaning close to a woman from legal. She was pretty, graceful, with a cheerful laugh.
Jay waited until Luc stepped away to order another drink, then intercepted him.
"What's up with you and Kia?"
Luc grinned. "What do you mean?"
"A couple of months ago, you said dating at the workplace was an awful idea."
"That was when I was in a relationship and level-headed. Now that I'm free, I'm much less concerned with what's wise and more with what feels good."
"That's terrible logic."
"Look at Kim and Ela. They're perfectly fine."
Jay had to admit it was true. Kim and Ela had been dating in secret for months, and their relationship hadn't impacted work or the team in any way. They weren't even all that sneaky anymore. Jay was sure everyone was aware. They simply chose not to address it directly.
"Still," Jay said.
Luc laughed and clapped him on the shoulder. "Anyway, why are you asking? Are you interested in someone? Maybe Jen from accounting? She's been trying to hit on you for ages."
Jay sighed deeply. "She's just being friendly."
"She's definitely not just being friendly."
"Even if it was more, I'm not interested. She's nice enough but we really don't have anything in common."
"Fair. But you should date someone eventually. You're too young to be this solitary."
"I'm fine."
"If you say so."
The party continued in good spirits. Ian found Jay in the other half of the venue, loading a plate of appetizers for what had to be the fourth time that evening.
"You already have a reputation for being a glutton," Ian said, sounding amused.
Jay shrugged. "At least it's better than having a reputation for dropping tables."
"That was months ago. No one remembers."
"I remember."
"What do you think of the venue?"
Jay looked around. "It's nice enough. But I liked the summer one last year much more. And I can't even remember the fall one."
"At least everyone looks better than last time. So maybe there's hope."
They chatted a bit more about the ambiance and the food. Eventually, Ian excused himself.
"I should go entertain Turner Senior. He's been glaring at me from across the room."
"Good luck with that."
"Enjoy the rest of your evening."
Ian left. Jay watched him go for a moment, following his path through the crowd. He was undoubtedly the most handsome man in the room. There were plenty of good-looking men at the party, but no one was quite as magnetic as Ian.
No wonder Jay felt flustered at the idea of being in love with him. He was sure everyone had their moments of gay panic when looking at Ian. Who wouldn't. Ian was... well, difficult to resist.
Jay sighed deeply again. He was sighing a lot that evening.
He finished his appetizers, made polite conversation with a few more colleagues, then said his farewells and called a taxi back home. He checked on the limousine through his window—still there, untouched—and collapsed into bed.
Tomorrow, he'd rest. And the day after, he was going to see his family.
He fell asleep thinking about the drive ahead and about the groceries waiting to be packed. Not about Ian's profile in the dim party lighting, or the way his voice had softened when they spoke. Definitely not about that.
Scene 5
Festive breakfast
Jay spent Easter Friday cleaning his apartment. Soon he'd move out. He wanted everything to be neat and tidy.
He moved his boxes near the exit, stacking them against the wall. Then he packed some of the remaining items he was still using occasionally—textbooks, a few dishes, the rest of his clothes. He left only the most immediate ones and toiletries. By the end of the day, the place was ready to be vacated.
Saturday morning he loaded the groceries and gifts into the limousine. He wore his newly bought clothes that looked a bit too elegant to truly pass as casual in his mind. Even the jeans from the upscale boutiques seemed somehow more posh. He dug out one of the sports jackets from one of the boxes to finish the look. He checked himself in the mirror. Nice, but not too ostentatious. He was reasonably content with the result. 
He left early. Traffic was minimal on the holiday weekend, so he arrived at his mother's house by noon. His mother greeted him at the door, pulling him into a warm embrace.
"Jay! You're here!"
"Hi, Mum."
"Come in, come in. You look wonderful. So grown up."
"Jay!" Ema practically tackled him with a hug. Tim and Ari crowded close behind.
"Did you bring the gifts?" Ari asked immediately.
"Hello to you too."
"But did you?"
"Yes, I brought gifts."
"I knew it!"
"Let him breathe, you three. Come in, Jay. You must be tired from the drive."
"I'm fine. Traffic was light."
His stepfather appeared briefly in the hallway.  "I'll be in the garden if anyone needs me."
They exchanged polite nods before he retreated to the garden to do whatever garden activities he preferred. That was their dynamic. Cordial distance.
His siblings, however, had no such reservations. They descended immediately.
"Did you attend any great balls recently?" Ema asked.
"A few," Jay admitted.
"Did you meet any movie stars?" Ari demanded.
"No movie stars."
"That's boring."
"Sorry to disappoint."
Jay unloaded the groceries in the kitchen. His mother followed, already pulling out pots and pans.
"You didn't have to bring all this," she said, peering into the bags.
"I wanted to help with the cooking."
"You don't need to cook. You're a guest."
"I insist."
They baked hams and stuffed poultry and chopped vegetables for salads. His mother directed, Jay followed. The kitchen filled with comforting smells—herbs, roasting meat. The kids drifted in and out, stealing bits of food and asking questions about the city.
In the afternoon, they painted eggs. All of them participated eagerly, even Tim who claimed it was childish but picked up a brush anyway. Ari made his bright green. Ema created delicate patterns. Jay painted simple stripes.
"Yours are boring," Ari announced.
"They're classic."
"Boring."
As evening approached, the siblings cornered him.
"Take us for a ride in the limousine," Tim said.
"Please, Jay. Just a short drive."
"It's not my car. It's a company car."
"But you're allowed to use it, right?"
"Yes, but—"
"Then let's go!"
Jay sighed theatrically. "Fine. But only for an hour."
They piled in, Tim claiming the front seat immediately. Jay drove them by the lake, despite the poor weather. The kids pressed against the windows, pointing out the landmarks. Ari fiddled with every button he could find. Ema took approximately fifty photos.
They only returned when it turned dark, the siblings chattering the entire way back.
The next day was typical continental Easter. Festive breakfast full of eggs, various hams and sausages, and three kinds of potato salads. It was loud and lively, everyone talking over each other.
Jay dispensed the gifts after breakfast. The kids were ecstatic.
"You got exactly what I wanted!" Ema squealed, hugging the weird-shaped lipsticks.
Ari tore open the superhero set with abandon. "This is perfect!"
Tim examined the modular hammock system. "Thanks, Jay."
There was also an entire bag of sweets, with some designer pralines for his mother and stepfather.
"You didn't have to spend so much," his mother said softly.
"I wanted to."
Lunch was equally excessive. Multiple courses, everyone eating until they couldn't move. Jay stayed over until afternoon, spending the whole day lounging about and eating. It felt domestic, nostalgic even.
His mother narrated family news while Jay mostly listened. Distant relatives getting married, neighbors moving away, local scandals Jay had no context for. Finally, he told them. "If everything resolves well, I'm buying a small apartment."
The kids erupted.
"You must absolutely host us over!" Ari insisted.
"It's quite small," Jay warned.
"We don't care."
"Ari and I will sleep on the floor. We want to see the city," Tim said. 
"We'll be so good. You won't even notice us," Ema promised.
"I'll definitely notice you."
But he promised anyway. "When I’m properly moved in, I’ll invite you."
His mother's eyes filled with tears. "Jay. I'm so happy for you."
She held his hand across the table, squeezing tightly. Before he left, she hugged him for a long time.
"I know your childhood wasn't the easiest. And I'm so glad you're doing well now."
Jay returned the embrace. "It was quite alright, Mum. I remember my early years fondly, despite everything. The neighborhood was quaint, if nothing else. The countryside was beautiful. It was a good place for a kid to grow up."
"You're kind to say so."
"I mean it."
She held him a moment longer, then released him. "Drive safely."
"I will."
His mother packed him a bunch of leftovers and homemade cakes. He loaded them into the car, waved goodbye, and drove back to the city.
He returned home late and tired. The apartment looked even emptier than before, boxes stacked by the door like silent sentinels. He showered quickly and dropped into bed.
Monday he spent eating the leftovers and browsing interior decor websites. The apartment was furnished, but minimally. While it looked nice, Jay already thought about functional improvements. Maybe a different table. Maybe another bookshelf. Perhaps some proper curtains. It still felt fragile to plan things like that. Like he didn't trust something wouldn't go wrong at the last moment.
Chapter 35: Home
Scene 1
Help
Jay arrived at the office at seven thirty on Tuesday morning. The building was quiet, the hallways empty. He made his way to his desk and set down his bag. The office felt peaceful.
He prepared coffee and opened his workstation. Outside, the sky was overcast. The temperature had climbed a few degrees. Spring was supposedly approaching, though the city remained stubbornly cold. He still wore his winter coat. The weather had been terrible for months now. He couldn't remember the last time April felt this frigid.
Ian arrived just before eight.
"Good morning," Ian said as he passed.
"Morning."
Ian paused at the threshold of his office. "How were your holidays?"
"Good. Very good, actually. I spent the weekend at my mother's house. We had the full Easter feast. Multiple courses, eggs, hams. I probably gained five kilograms. I'll have to work out twice as hard at the gym today."
"It sounds like you enjoyed yourself."
"I did. It was nice to spend time with my family. My mother cried when I told her about the apartment."
"She must be proud of you."
"I think she is. What about you? Did you take any time off?"
"I researched potential candidates for the new positions. We have several promising picks. I have a good feeling about them. Hopefully by May the team will expand."
"That would be a relief."
"Yes. It would. You look better."
"I feel better. The break helped."
"Good. That's good."
Ian entered his office, and Jay returned to his desk. Work felt manageable again after the relentless months of strategy season. The backlog was shrinking. They were catching up. The other coworkers began arriving soon. Amy came in first, then Kim and Ela. By nine the office was alive again.
"How was your holiday?" Zoe asked as she passed Jay's desk.
"Great. I visited my family. You?"
"I stayed home and read books."
Luc appeared shortly after, looking unusually cheerful. "Jay! You're back. Did you bring any leftover cake?"
"My mother sent me home with enough food to last a week."
"You should share."
"It's in my fridge at home."
"Tragic."
Max wandered over with his coffee. "Welcome back, Jay. Good holiday?"
"Very good. Yours?"
"Excellent. I went hiking with my wife. The trails were muddy but beautiful."
Everyone exchanged stories. Ela had visited her sister. Amy had reorganized her house. The atmosphere was relaxed. The pressure of the previous months had finally lifted. Jay worked through the morning. Shortly before lunch, his phone rang. An unfamiliar number.
"Hello?"
"Good morning, Mr. Hall. This is Jasper Bank. I'm calling to inform you that your mortgage paperwork is complete. You can come in to sign at your convenience."
"Oh. That's excellent news. Tomorrow at four?"
"That works perfectly. We'll see you then."
"Thank you."
Jay ended the call and sat very still. It was real. It was actually happening. He got up and walked to Ian's door. Ian looked up from his monitor.
"Something wrong?"
"No. The opposite, actually. The bank just called. My mortgage paperwork is ready. I need to sign tomorrow. Would it be alright if I left early? Around three thirty?"
"Of course. Take whatever time you need."
"Thank you."
Jay returned to his desk. His hands were shaking slightly. He called the agent next.
"Mr. Hall! Perfect timing. I was just about to reach out to you."
"The bank called. I'm signing tomorrow at four."
"Wonderful. I'll meet you there. We'll handle everything at once. If all goes smoothly, you'll have your keys by the end of the week."
"This week?"
"Absolutely. These things move quickly when the paperwork is in order."
"I see."
"We pride ourselves on it. I'll see you tomorrow at the bank."
After they hung up, Jay set down his phone. This week. He'd expected another month of waiting. Instead, everything was accelerating. That afternoon at the gym, Jay found Rus immediately.
"Are you free this weekend? The mortgage paperwork is ready. I'm signing tomorrow. The agent says I'll have the keys this week."
"This week? That's fast."
"Very fast. I was wondering if you'd be available Saturday afternoon? For the move?"
"Saturday? Yeah, I can do that. I'll bring the van. You want me to ask the guys?"
"If they're free, that would be helpful."
"Consider it done. Don't skip Saturday morning's session, though. It's your last workout before you abandon us for your fancy new neighbourhood."
"I'm not abandoning anyone."
"Sure. That's what they all say."
"I'll be there Saturday morning. Promise."
"Good."
The next day, Jay left work at three-thirty. The taxi ride to the bank felt surreal, like he was watching someone else's life unfold. The agent was already waiting outside.
"Mr. Hall. Right on time."
"Hello."
They entered together. A woman led them to a private office. The paperwork was extensive. Jay read through it, though he trusted Ian's recommendations. Everything was as discussed before. Interest rate, down payment, payment schedule, terms and conditions. He noticed something when he reached the purchase contract.
"There's a parking spot listed."
"Yes, spot 34 in the underground garage," the agent confirmed.
"And a storage unit."
"Unit 73B. That's my fault for not mentioning it earlier. It came with the property."
Jay looked at him. The agent's expression was completely innocent.
"I see."
He signed anyway. It was too late to object now, and the rest of the contract was reasonable. The money transfer happened instantly. They left the bank and drove to the notary's office. More paperwork. More signatures. The agent produced utility contracts.
"We should handle these now as well," the agent said.
They found a coffee shop and claimed a secluded table.
"Internet providers?" the agent asked, pulling up a comparison sheet.
Jay scanned the options. "This one. The fastest available."
"It comes bundled with full cable television access."
"That's fine. I didn't even have a television before," he said absently.
"You'll enjoy it. The cable package includes quite a lot."
Jay signed the last form. The agent handed him a set of keys.
"Congratulations, Mr. Hall. I’ll forward these forms to the relevant offices. The utilities will be active within twenty-four hours. You're free to move in whenever you'd like."
Jay accepted the small key ring. Two keys, plus a fob for the building entrance.
"Thank you."
"It was my pleasure. If you need anything else, don't hesitate to call."
Jay took a taxi back to his studio. It was nearly eight when he arrived. He set the keys on the kitchen counter and looked around. Boxes everywhere. His entire life packed and ready to go.
He texted Rus. "Saturday move is confirmed. Got the keys today."
The response came quickly. "We will be ready. See you Saturday."
Jay made himself dinner from the leftovers his mother had packed. Just a few more days and he'd leave this place behind. The apartment felt strange now, like it already belonged to someone else.
Thursday morning, he arrived at work early again. When Ian came in, Jay went straight to his office.
"It's done," Jay said from the doorway.
Ian looked up. "The apartment?"
"Everything's signed. I have the keys. I'm moving in Saturday."
"This Saturday? Do you need help?"
"Rus and some friends from the gym are coming with a van. I couldn't possibly ask my boss to help me move boxes."
"I'm not just your boss. I'd like to think I'm also a friend. And soon I'll be your neighbour. But if having me there would be awkward—"
"No," Jay interrupted quickly. "It wouldn't be awkward at all. I'd love for you to be there. I just didn't want to impose."
"You're not imposing."
"Then I'd appreciate your help."
"What time?"
"Afternoon. Probably around two?"
"I'll be there."
Ian felt guilty about the manipulation, but he wanted to be there. This was important. He wouldn't miss it.
At lunch, Jay mentioned it to the others. "I'm moving on Saturday. To the new apartment."
"Finally! Do you need help?" Luc asked. 
"I have a few people coming already. But if you're free—"
"I'm free. I'll be there. I want to see this place anyway."
Zoe looked up from her salad. "I can help too. I don't have plans Saturday afternoon."
"Are you sure? It's just moving boxes."
"Someone needs to make sure Luc doesn't snoop through all your things."
"I'm going to snoop. I'm very curious about how normal people live."
"You're exhausting," Zoe said.
"I'm helpful."
"Alright. Saturday afternoon, then. Thank you," Jay said.
Kim grinned. "Bringing half the office to your new place. This is basically a housewarming party."
"It's not a party. It's just moving boxes."
Jay looked around the table at his coworkers—his friends—and smiled. He'd come to this company alone and uncertain. Now he had more help than he knew what to do with.
Scene 2
Interior design
Jay left work at five on Thursday and headed straight for the upscale department store downtown. He wanted to make his first night in the new apartment special.
The store was enormous. Jay started in the alcohol section. He needed to thank his friends properly for helping with the move. He selected a few bottles of whiskey, wincing slightly at the price but adding it to his cart anyway. Then three different wines. An assortment of crunchy snacks and fancy dips.
But those were for his guests. For himself, for the first night, he wanted something more.
New pyjamas. Soft, comfortable ones in deep blue. Fluffy slippers. A long bathrobe in cream. Brand new toiletries with rich, fresh smells. He opened several bottles, testing the scents—bergamot and cedar and something citrus.
Then towels. Thick, colourful ones. He wanted to coordinate his bathroom, make it bright and cheerful. Spring was coming. He picked lime green as his theme. Bath towels and hand towels in matching shades.
A new iron. A kettle. Pots and pans. A hairdryer. He'd never used one before, but now he had space for it. Why not?
Bath products. Sponges. Bath bombs in a glass jar. Salts in various colours and fragrances. Subtle scent sachets for his new closets. Fragrance sticks for the living room.
He really knocked himself out. He didn't look at the cost at all. His recent paycheck and raise had put him in comfortable territory again. The apartment cost was no longer extravagant. He had savings on top of it. To hell with frugality. He was moving into his own home. He would splurge.
He also bought soil and a fresh pot for his spider plant. He'd researched its preferences beforehand and consulted a store assistant with photos of the plant from different angles.
"This one needs good drainage. And indirect light. This ceramic pot would be perfect size," the assistant said, examining the photos. 
"I'll take it."
His companion deserved upgrades too.
When he took the taxi back to his studio, he was loaded with packages and struggled up the stairs, bags cutting into his hands. He really couldn't wait for a place with an elevator.
He immediately did laundry, loading two full rounds into the machines in the basement. The last rounds of laundry in this laundromat before he ascended to having a personal machine in his bathroom. He packed everything in a fresh box labeled "for the first night."
Then he re-potted his plant, transferring it to the new ceramic pot. It looked dignified now, sitting on the table. He'd need a decorative stand for it as well.
He spent the rest of the evening browsing the website of a big furniture store, selecting small decor items. Bathroom rugs. Cushions. Lighting fixtures. He added them all to his cart, planning to get them the next day.
He had trouble falling asleep that night. His head filled with images of rugs, curtains, cushions and boxes. When the alarm rang at six the next morning, he didn't feel rested at all.
He got up anyway and took a cold shower. He couldn't even drink coffee or have breakfast. Everything was already packed, and he had no food left in the fridge.
He left for work early and bought breakfast at his favourite bakery on the way, which he ate at his desk.
He couldn't focus on work. His attention drifted to clothes hangers and sock storage solutions. Every now and then he'd open the furniture store web page and compare plates and glasses.
Ian approached his desk at one of those moments. Jay had three different dish sets open in separate tabs.
Ian looked at the screen with a barely contained smile. He pointed to one set. "This one looks best."
Jay's face burned. "I'm working. Mostly."
"Of course. The blue trim is elegant."
"You think so?"
"I do."
Ian didn't move away immediately, giving suggestions on various items, and Jay was too excited to feel truly embarrassed. As soon as five came, he almost darted out of the office.
"See you tomorrow!" he called to Ian, Luc, and Zoe.
He took a taxi straight to the furniture store. It was massive, floor after floor of arranged displays. He spent hours touching rugs and measuring tables. He bought everything he'd planned. Bathroom rug to match the towels. Colour-coordinated containers for soap and body wash and shampoo. A really fluffy living room rug and a matching mat for the door. Silky bed sheets and bedding. Pillows and cushions. The decorative stand for his plant. Lightning fixtures that looked fancy. Cleaning and laundry supplies.
The checkout took twenty minutes. The total made him wince, but only slightly. He ate dinner in the store restaurant, surrounded by an entire cart full of items. He'd gotten overexcited.
Getting everything to the taxi was an ordeal. He called for one of the large vehicles and threw apologetic looks at the driver as he loaded the trunk with furniture boxes, some of them quite heavy.
"Moving day?" the driver asked.
"Tomorrow. Just getting ready."
"That's a lot of ready."
Jay laughed breathlessly. "Yes. Thank you for your patience."
"No problem. I've seen worse."
Jay thanked his foresight to start going to the gym. A year of regular workouts definitely helped with the heavy lifting.
As they drove toward his new apartment, the vision of getting everything upstairs seemed bleak. Even with an elevator, it would be difficult. He thought for a moment, then called Ian.
"Hello?"
"Hi. Are you already home?"
"I am. Is something wrong?"
"No. Nothing's wrong. I was wondering if you could come over in fifteen minutes? I'm on my way to the apartment and I have an excessive amount of packages."
He could almost hear Ian grin through the phone. "I'll be there."
When they arrived, Ian was already waiting in front of the building. He was still in his suit with a coat over it. The evening air was cold.
"I'm so sorry. I got overexcited," Jay said immediately.
He opened the trunk. Ian looked at the mountain of boxes and tried to suppress his grin.
"You certainly did."
"I can manage if—"
"Don't be absurd."
Ian began unloading the boxes, wielding the heaviest ones as if they weighed nothing. Jay gave a generous tip to the driver when they were done. They stood in front of the building entrance, looking at the tower of boxes in dismay.
"I got overexcited," Jay said pitifully.
"It's understandable."
"Is it?"
"Yes."
Ian picked up two of the largest boxes. "Let's get these inside."
It took several trips. Jay opened the door with his new key, stepping inside and looking around. The apartment looked dull in the evening lamplight. Bare and impersonal.
"Would you like tea? Or coffee?" Jay asked, then remembered. "Oh. The new kettle is still at my studio.'"
"It's quite alright."
Ian was already taking off his coat and shoes, clearly intending to help unpack.
"You really don't have to—"
"I'm already here. Just tell me where things go."
Jay wanted to protest, but frankly he needed the help. "The bathroom things go in the bathroom. Kitchen items in the kitchen. Everything else in the living room for now."
They got to work. Jay started the first load of laundry in the washing machine—the new sheets he planned to use. The machine had a massive display with countless options. He skimmed the user manual and selected what seemed appropriate, watching with fascination as it started.
"This is so much better than the basement laundromat," he murmured.
"I'd imagine so."
While it washed, he began unloading dishes with Ian and loading them into the dishwasher. He hand-washed two glasses and filled them with tap water.
"The building has filters installed. Apparently the tap water is actually good."
He tasted it. It didn't taste like pipes at all.
"It is," Ian confirmed.
They placed rugs and lights and candle holders. Cushions on the sofa. Remains of boxes went into a pile by the door. Jay moved the laundry to the dryer. They rinsed cupboards, washed dishes, dried them, placed them in their new homes. After over three hours, they looked at their handiwork. The place looked much more cosy.
Then Jay took down the generic wall decor that came with the apartment. Abstract prints in muted colours.
"This is depressing," he said.
"Agreed."
"Let me put these in the storage. Want to see it?"
They went down to the basement level. The storage unit was quite large, placed right next to the designated parking spot. He placed the unwanted art inside and looked around.
"This is huge. I won't have to worry about space for years."
He turned to Ian. He had zero doubts this arrangement was also Ian's doing. The parking spot, the storage, the impossibly good mortgage rate. All of it. He didn't comment. He just sighed deeply and smiled the most radiant smile Ian had ever seen. Jay looked so happy. It was worth everything.
"Thank you. For everything."
"You're welcome."
"We should head back up. The laundry should be done by now," Jay said finally.
"Yes. Of course."
They took the elevator back to the fourth floor. The apartment felt warmer now. Jay pulled the bedding from the dryer. It was still slightly damp but warm and soft.
"I'll iron the sheets properly tomorrow and make the bed," Jay said, checking his watch. "It's already past eleven."
"I should go."
"I couldn't have done this without you."
"I'm glad I could help."
Ian collected his coat and shoes. Jay walked him to the door.
"See you tomorrow?" Ian asked.
"Tomorrow. I'm looking forward to it."
After Ian left, Jay took one last look around. The apartment glowed in the lamplight. He set out the fragrance sticks, placing just three in the container so the scent wouldn't overwhelm, then locked the door behind him.
One more night in the old place. Tomorrow he'd move his boxes and leave for good. Tomorrow, he'd begin a new chapter of his life.
He returned and fell asleep almost immediately, exhausted and content, dreaming of lime-green towels and filtered water and Ian's smile in the warm light of his new home.
Scene 3
The move
Jay woke up at seven on Saturday morning. He set out his clothes for the day, then packed the rest of his things. The sheets from the bed. The last glass. Everything else was already boxed and ready.
He ate breakfast at a nearby café, then stopped at a local bakery on his way back. He bought a proper cake and a selection of pastries for the evening. Then he headed to the gym for one last session in his old neighbourhood.
He was both excited and frigid with anxiety. Just a few more hours.
Rus patted his back reassuringly. "You look like you're about to throw up."
"I might."
"Things will be alright. It's just moving."
"I know."
They arranged to meet at one at Jay's old apartment. Then Jay went back for his last shower there. He wore clean clothes—his new jeans, sneakers, and a fresh gym shirt. He packed everything else, including his still-damp towel in a plastic bag.
He did one last survey of every nook and cranny. The fridge was already cleaned and unplugged. The old appliances donated. He was ready.
Rus arrived punctually at one with Mic and Van in a worn white minivan he'd borrowed from his brother-in-law.
"Ready?" Rus asked.
"Ready."
They got to work right away, moving the boxes down the stairs one by one. They were done in twenty minutes.
"Good thing you don't have many possessions," Mic said, loading the last box.
"Makes the job easier," Van agreed.
As they secured the boxes in the vehicle, Jay did one last inspection of the apartment. He took several photos. The place looked clean, modest, barren. It was a depressing sight.
He picked up his spider plant and joined his friends in the minivan. They departed for his new home.
"There will be additional people waiting for us. My coworkers volunteered to help," Jay said as they drove.
"The more the merrier," Rus said.
Jay sent messages that they were on their way. He sat in the passenger seat while Mic and Van talked in the back. He looked out the window at the passing city. It was late April already. The weather had mercifully gotten a bit warmer.
When they arrived, people were already waiting in front of the building. Zoe and Luc each held a large bag. Ian stood next to several big packages, one of them thin, tall, and wide. He wore jeans, sneakers, and a sweater. It was the first time Jay had seen him wear something that looked like actual casual wear. His hair was slightly ruffled, as if he'd run his hand through it to complete the look. Or perhaps it got tousled when he wrestled with whatever he'd brought.
Next to him stood Leo, equally loaded with big bags.
Jay's face fell.
They climbed out of the van. Ian stepped forward with a proposal.
"We can park in the underground spot. It's close to the elevator. Much easier."
But before they could move, Jay addressed Leo directly. "I don't recall inviting you."
Leo made an innocent face. "I invited myself."
Rus sensed the tension. "Something wrong?"
Jay made a face. "This is Leo. The man who hired me. The son of the owner of the company."
"Oh. Is this the guy who hired you because you're pretty?" Rus looked Leo up and down.
Jay's face went red. "Yes."
Rus burst out laughing. Everyone else joined in, tension breaking like a snapped wire.
Leo looked scandalized. "It seems Jay has been telling stories about me."
"Accurate stories," Jay said.
"I want to make amends to my favourite employee." Leo placed a hand over his chest dramatically. "And for the record, I didn't hire you for your looks. I hired you for your mettle. The HR department already did the preliminary selection. They only sent me presentable candidates. Your looks were just a bonus."
"Questionable judgement on all counts," Jay muttered.
"I'm properly apologetic. I brought housewarming gifts. This seemed like the best moment to fix our relationship. You won't be so heartless as to chase me off, will you?"
Jay sighed. "Suit yourself."
They parked in the underground spot. Jay made proper introductions. Luc already knew Rus and his friends from the fencing debacle, but the others were new.
"I thought Ian was the boss," Rus said, looking confused.
"I am," Ian confirmed. "The hierarchy is rather relaxed."
Rus eyed Ian suspiciously but said nothing.
They began taking boxes up. With so many people and the elevator, the entire process took record time. Everyone made themselves comfortable inside while Jay directed which boxes went where.
People volunteered to help unpack. Jay eventually gave in and started assigning tasks.
Ian and Leo went to the bedroom to unpack clothes. Zoe and Luc dealt with the dishes. Rus, Mic, and Van stayed in the living room unpacking books and various trinkets.
Jay moved around everyone, instructing and coordinating. He placed his spider plant in a prominent spot on the bookshelf. He shooed Luc away from trying to rummage through his underwear drawer.
"I was just trying to help organize," Luc protested.
"Organize somewhere else."
Jay watched for a moment as Ian expertly hung his suits in the massive closet, organized by colour and formality level. Then he sorted the ties with equal expertise.
Rus was folding the empty boxes into a neat pile near the door. Very soon everything was unpacked, and things without a final destination got shoved into the entrance closet for Jay's further decision.
Jay boiled water in the new kettle for refreshments. As the work was drawing to a close, Leo made an offer.
"I'll order takeout from a local place I know and like. My treat."
Jay accepted reluctantly. He'd wanted to do that himself.
The food arrived as they were finishing up, barely past four. The entire production took less than three hours. Jay was impressed by what a big and motivated party could accomplish in such a short time.
They took places around the apartment. The dining table could fit four people comfortably. Rus, Mic, Van, and Luc sat there. Ian and Leo sat on the sofa. Zoe took the armchair. Jay sat on a cushion in front of the coffee table.
Jay insisted they unload the takeout onto proper plates.
"I bought new plates and I want to test drive them."
"Fair enough," Luc said.
Jay had bought everything in sets of eight, thinking of the size of their team at work. It perfectly matched the number of people present.
The food was Mediterranean but very diverse. Leo had ordered enough for twice as many people.
"At least you'll have leftovers to last you a couple of days while you're getting used to the place," Leo said.
Jay opened the alcohol bottles. Everyone poured themselves their preferred drinks. Zoe made a cocktail. Luc and Leo hoarded wine. Rus's team and Ian preferred straight whiskey. Jay poured himself a glass of wine.
Someone took photos. Laughter and chatter filled the apartment. It was small, and such a crowd barely fit, but somehow it didn't feel cramped. It felt convivial. Then the gifts were handed out.
Rus and his friends produced a bag with fitness equipment. A yoga mat, dumbbells, stretching bands.
"Don't neglect your form now that you won't have me regularly watching after you," Rus said.
"I won't. Promise."
Zoe brought several big boxes of different candles. "There's always a time for mood lighting." She also produced a big cake.
Luc handed over a large, modern, abstractly shaped crystal vase and a bouquet of fresh flowers that he'd somehow managed to keep hidden but that hadn't withered at all.
"It's too big for the place," Jay said, setting it on the coffee table.
"It adds character," Luc insisted.
"It does," Zoe agreed.
Leo took out the newest generation console in a limited edition version with a whole box of accessories. Jay looked at it suspiciously.
"I heard you have younger siblings who will definitely visit. At least you should keep them entertained."
From the second bag he produced an entire selection of clearly expensive alcohol and soft drinks. Then he reached for the largest bag resting in the corner. Out came a proper sound system, complete with surprisingly large speakers. "The least we could do was make it a proper party."
Rus and his friends cheered. Jay looked miserable. "I don't want a police visit on my first night here."
He got ignored. The party started in earnest.
Ian tried to comfort him. "The soundproofing in these buildings is great. It's a good opportunity to test it."
Ian then handed over his gift. The big box turned out to be a painting. It was from the same artist Jay had enjoyed at the art show last year, a piece vaguely similar to the one Ian had in his living room.
Jay was touched. "This is beautiful."
They hung it where the generic art had been before in the central living room. It livened up the place.
Ian also handed him a huge bag of various groceries. "For a good start."
And another bag of bed sheets and towels in coordinated colours. "For when you'd like to change the colour scheme."
He also produced another large cake.
"That's three cakes," Zoe observed.
"We'll manage," Luc said confidently.
Jay set everything down. He looked at Ian, then at everyone else in the apartment. At the gifts. At the laughter. At the home they'd helped him create. He was so touched by everyone's generosity that he didn't even complain about them getting rowdy. Even Leo seemed less offensive somehow.
"Thank you. All of you. Really."
"You're welcome," Zoe said.
"It's what friends do," Luc added.
Leo raised his glass. "To Jay's new home."
"To Jay's new home!" everyone echoed.
Jay raised his own glass and drank. The wine was good. The food was good. The company was good. Everything was good.
Scene 4
Housewarming party
The party continued. Luc and Rus plugged in the audio system. Jay pulled out his laptop to play some music.
Luc's eyes widened. "That's a top-of-the-line model."
Jay looked sheepish. "It's courtesy of our foreign clients we signed last year."
"Kim would die from jealousy if he saw it."
"Best not to show it to him then."
Music filled the apartment—something upbeat that made people start moving unconsciously.
In the meantime, Mic was attempting to charm Zoe. She listened politely for approximately thirty seconds before shutting him down completely.
"I appreciate the interest, but no thank you."
Mic retreated to the balcony railing to sulk over his whiskey. Leo joined him, clapping him on the shoulder. "Chin up. Plenty of other opportunities."
"She didn't even hesitate."
Inside, Jay found Zoe by the drinks table. "I'm so sorry about Mic. He's absolutely a menace. Don't feel guilty about telling him off."
Zoe smiled. "I don't. I've handled worse."
Van had migrated to the couch next to Ian, examining him with open curiosity. "You're pretty well-built for a banker."
"I work out regularly."
"Yeah? What's your routine?"
Ian described his training schedule. Van's face lit up with immediate interest. They began comparing their fitness achievements and diet plans. Van got more and more animated by the minute. Hydration, protein, creatine. Jay caught only the general idea and shook his head in theatrical resignation. Rus joined their conversation as well. Soon the couch and its orbit turned into a fitness discussion club.
Zoe turned to Jay. "Want to make a quick run to the store? We need ice for drinks. And I want coconut milk for cocktails."
"Let's go then."
They left for the nearby grocery store. When they returned twenty minutes later, they saw Van without his shirt, flexing his muscles while Luc and Leo cheered enthusiastically.
Jay facepalmed. "What's going on?"
Rus explained happily. "Van is doing a demonstration of the superiority of his particular workout philosophy."
Jay moved to the kitchen area with Zoe and their shopping. Zoe made fancy drinks for everyone interested, which was only herself, Jay, and Luc. Rus joined them but only to add ice to his whiskey glass. Ian came as well.
They began chatting more seriously. The alcohol seemed to make Rus more blunt.
"You're Jay's boss, right?"
"I am."
"You've been making Jay stressed. Working unreasonable hours. That's poor management."
Jay tried to intervene. "Rus—"
"I'm not wrong."
Leo looked highly amused.
Ian's expression was calm. "You're right. It was my failure. We're expanding the team to ensure the workload is more equally divided. We should have done this much earlier."
Rus approved. "Good that you at least see your faults."
"Rus, please—" Jay tried again.
They both completely disregarded him.
"You're different than I imagined. I can see why Jay is so fiercely loyal. A man with such gym discipline must have his priorities in order."
Ian looked briefly startled, then recovered. "Thank you."
Meanwhile, Luc started arm wrestling with Van on the small coffee table. He lost spectacularly.
"I told Jay he needed more space for entertaining. If the living room had enough room I'd definitely win," Luc grumbled.
Everyone laughed.
The scene continued to be rowdy with music and cheering. Jay went outside to do a loudness check. The soundproofing was impressive. Maybe they really wouldn't have the cops called on them.
Eventually Leo excused himself. "I should head out. Thank you for tolerating me."
"Thank you for coming. And for the gifts," Jay said diplomatically.
"You're welcome. Enjoy the console."
Zoe left shortly after. "This was fun. Your place is lovely, Jay."
"Thanks for the candles."
The rest stayed and partied for two more hours. Once ten came and they made no move to leave, Ian noticed Jay getting sleepy. He ushered the company away.
"Time to go," Ian said firmly.
"Already?" Rus protested.
"It's getting late."
"We can come to my place. I've got more whiskey." Luc said.
Jay handed them a box with leftover cake and two bottles of whiskey from Leo's stash.
"Thanks for everything," Jay said.
"We'll return for the car some other time," Rus said.
Then they were gone, and Jay was alone with Ian in a completely wrecked apartment. But Jay was in such a good mood he didn't mind. He looked around at the chaos and smiled.
Ian began collecting dishes. Jay moved to protest, but Ian was already loading the dishwasher.
"You don't have to," Jay protested.
"I want to."
"You've already done so much."
"It's just cleaning."
They worked together. Leftovers into the fridge, dishes into the dishwasher, trash into bags. Ian accompanied Jay to the trash building, a separate structure near the street, locked and surprisingly orderly.
"This is so much better than my old place," Jay said, impressed.
"It's a well-maintained building."
They returned to wipe the surfaces, wash and store plates, and load another dishwasher full of glasses. Jay was amazed at the utility.
"A washing machine. A dishwasher. It's like living in the future."
"You should get a robot vacuum."
Jay laughed. "That's ridiculous."
Ian collected his coat and moved toward the door. "I should go."
"Stay a bit longer?" Jay asked.
"It's late. You're tired."
"I know. But I don't feel like ending the evening quite yet. My first night in my new home. It feels weirdly scary. What if I wake up and it turns out to be a dream?"
"It's not a dream."
"But what if it is?"
Ian turned back. "I can stay if it will make you more comfortable."
"The couch is definitely much more comfortable than my last one. And I definitely liked it much more when you were there when I woke up hungover than the alternative of having to get my water myself."
"You're drunk."
"Only a little."
"I'll stay then."
Jay suddenly remembered something. "I wanted to iron the sheets before sleeping."
"I'll do it. You should shower."
"Bath. I want to try the bath."
"Then take a bath."
Jay disappeared into the bathroom. Soon after, steam began seeping under the door, filling the air with the scent of at least seven bath products. The whole place started smelling like an expensive perfumery.
Ian found the iron and ironing board in the entrance closet, set them up in the bedroom, and got to work on the sheets. Then he made the bed properly.
The bathroom door opened eventually. Jay emerged in soft new pyjamas, wearing his bathrobe, a lime-green towel wrapped around his hair, fluffy slippers on his feet. He looked absolutely blissful.
"That was amazing. The bath is huge. I could practically swim in it."
"I'm glad you enjoyed it."
Jay moved to the kitchen and began heating milk in a small pot, adding honey and spices. He poured two mugs and brought them to the couch. They sat together, drinking warm milk like children. The apartment was quiet now, music off. Jay's eyes were drooping. He finished his milk, brushed his teeth, and stumbled toward the bedroom.
"Thank you," he called out. "For everything."
"You're welcome. Sleep well."
Ian tidied up the rest of the place. He checked that everything was secure. The door was locked. The windows were closed. The kitchen was clean.
Then he dropped onto the couch. It really was bigger and more comfortable than Jay's old one. It could even be opened to make a proper bed, though Ian didn't bother. He lay down as he was, fully dressed, and stared at the ceiling.
It had been a great day. Jay was happy. Safe. Surrounded by people who cared about him. Living in a beautiful space that he could truly call home.
Ian closed his eyes and let himself feel the joy of having helped make this happen. Of being here for Jay's first night. Of being trusted enough to stay.
Scene 5
First morning
Jay woke up the next morning and groaned immediately. His head felt like someone had stuffed it with cotton and then set it on fire. The light coming through the window was too bright, the world too loud, everything too much. A voice cut through the fog.
"Here. Take this."
He lifted his head with difficulty. Ian stood beside the bed, holding out a glass of water and a painkiller.
Jay accepted both, swallowing the pill with a croaking "Thank you."
"You're welcome."
Jay collapsed back against the pillow. "I can't believe I made you babysit my hangover again."
Ian laughed. "I'm starting to have some experience in this matter. I'll make coffee."
He left the bedroom. Jay lay there for another minute, gathering the strength to move. Eventually he managed to sit up, then stand. He shuffled out of the bedroom on unsteady feet. He made his way to the armchair and collapsed into it, pulling his legs up under himself and burying his head in his arms. The nausea was tolerable if he stayed very still. The headache was another matter.
"It will pass," Ian said softly.
Jay groaned.
Ian placed a coffee in front of him and sat on the couch on the opposite side. "How was your first night in your own home?"
Jay lifted his head and smiled wistfully. "It still doesn't feel real."
Ian thought he looked adorable in his pajamas. So pitiful and fragile and vulnerable. His defenses were down completely.
Eventually, Jay stood up when his headache began to subside slightly. "I'm going to take a shower."
"Take your time."
Jay disappeared into the bathroom and turned the water as cold as he could stand. He stayed under it for a long time, letting it wash away the worst of the hangover. When he emerged, he was wrapped in his bathrobe with his hair dripping.
"Better?" Ian asked.
"Much better. I'm glad I didn't drink too much. This is bearable."
They heated up leftovers from the party for breakfast. Jay ate slowly, testing his stomach's tolerance. It held up well enough.
"Do you want to sit on the balcony?" Jay asked when they finished eating.
Ian looked toward the windows. "It's quite cold out."
"I know. But I want to try it anyway. We can make tea. Something warming."
"Alright."
Jay got dressed and prepared root spices tea while Ian cleared the dishes. They huddled themselves in colourful soft blankets and sat on the patio couch outside, watching the river and the gray skies. The weather was miserable by any objective measure. Cold, overcast, threatening rain. But Jay thought it looked beautiful. His headache and nausea receded. He'd never felt happier.
He stole glances at Ian's face as he sat wrapped in the deep burgundy blanket and watched the weather. Jay was glad he got to share this moment with him. His first morning in his new home. He would treasure this for the rest of his life. They sat until their fingers grew stiff and their noses turned red from the cold. Finally Ian got up.
"We should go inside before we freeze."
"Probably wise."
They abandoned the balcony and returned inside, both smiling at their red faces.
"That was ridiculous," Ian said, rubbing his hands together.
"Completely worth it."
Inside, warmth slowly returned to their extremities. Jay made more tea. Then something occurred to him.
In the apartment, two spare sets of keys had been waiting for him, along with a folder of useful administrative information. He picked up one set and held it out to Ian. "Would you hold onto this? In case of emergency? I don't really have anyone else in the city."
Ian took the key, trying to act normal despite his heart contracting painfully in his chest.
"Of course. You can list me as an emergency contact too. I'm your boss after all."
Such complete faith. Ian would make sure to prove himself worthy of it.
"Thank you."
"You're welcome."
Eventually Ian said his farewells and left. Jay spent the rest of Sunday reshuffling things in his cupboards and checking interior decor and appliances online.
All of his belongings were already here, yet not even half of the storage was filled. His clothes were neatly arranged in the bedroom closet with plenty of space to spare. He could finally buy casual clothes. He had enough counter space to buy a coffee maker. All of it was unreal.
Rus came by in the evening to collect his car.
"We all crashed at Luc's place," Rus explained. "Just sobered up enough to drive now."
"I'm glad you had fun."
"It was a great party. Your place is amazing."
"Thank you for helping with the move."
"Anytime. Keep in touch, alright?"
"I will."
The burgundy blanket that Ian had used on the balcony smelled like him. Jay noticed in the evening when he was folding it. It was a divine, comforting smell. Jay took the blanket to bed with him, hugging it close. He fell asleep like that, wrapped in Ian's scent, feeling safe. He slept well that night.
The next day was Jay's first workday commuting from the new place. He got up at six as always, feeling unusually well rested. He drank coffee from the new kettle, leisurely ate leftovers, and prepared for work.
His commute was now ten minutes shorter overall. The metro ride was only ten minutes, but the walk to the metro was a bit longer. He left his home at seven as he always did and arrived at work at seven twenty-five. He still didn't have an optimal schedule and felt awkward with the new route, but he was also excited.
At work he talked about nothing else but his new apartment.
"The balcony has a view of the river," he told Ela.
"That's lovely."
"The dishwasher is incredible," he told Luc.
"Welcome to modern living."
"I have an entire closet just for clothes," he told Amy.
"That's practical."
At five, Jay went to Ian's office. Ian was reviewing documents, but looked up when Jay entered.
"Do you need something?"
"Not really. I just wanted to talk about coffee makers."
"Coffee makers?"
"I'm trying to decide between models. Do you have time?"
"I have time."
They spent two hours discussing coffee makers, storage solutions, and kitchen organization. Jay felt a bit embarrassed to take so much of Ian's time with such trivial matters, but the excitement overrode the guilt.
In the following days, the initial excitement waned to manageable levels. On Tuesday he left at five with a gym bag in hand. He took the metro back to his old neighbourhood.
Rus looked surprised when he walked into the gym. "You came back."
"I still have a paid membership. It would be a waste not to use it. I'll keep returning until the end of the month at least."
"Fair enough."
They chatted while working out. Rus brought up Jay's coworkers.
"I understand now why you're so fond of your job despite its unreasonableness. Your coworkers seem to be great people."
"They truly are. The whole team is amazing."
"And your boss isn't as scary as I expected."
"Ian's not scary at all."
"He's very dedicated to fitness. I respect that."
"He's dedicated to everything he does."
For the rest of the week, Ian was away in the afternoons holding interviews with candidates for senior analysts. Jay left at five since there was nothing urgent to do. Staying in an empty office to tackle less urgent tasks held no appeal.
Instead, he explored his new neighbourhood. He walked through parks. He cooked dinner in his new kitchen, experimenting with recipes he'd never had space to try before. He sat on the balcony with warm milk and honey and spices, watching the river and the sky.
This was so much better than his old place. Better than anything he'd imagined having. He kept expecting to wake up and find it was all a dream. But each morning he woke up in his new bed, in his new apartment, and it was still real.

Chapter 36: Foolish fantasies
Scene 1
Ray Shore
May arrived with gentle warmth and clear skies. The endless rain finally stopped. Trees bloomed in full force, painting the streets in white and pink. Jay walked to the metro each morning through the park near his apartment, listening to birds sing in the branches overhead. The air smelled fresh and green. Everything felt new.
He stopped one morning to watch sunlight filter through the blossoms. A month ago he'd been huddled against the rain, miserable and lost. Now he stood in his new neighbourhood, on his way to a job he'd chosen to keep, with a home that was actually his. The difference was staggering.
On Monday morning, Ian called a team meeting before the work began. Everyone gathered in the conference room looking curious.
"I wanted to give you advance notice. We're bringing on a new senior analyst today. His name is Ray Shore. He's a former classmate of mine and exceptionally skilled at analysis."
Amy looked pleased. "That's excellent news."
"There's something you should know beforehand. Ray is brilliant, but his personality can be difficult. He's blunt. He has no social graces whatsoever. He may come across as rude."
The team exchanged glances.
"How rude are we talking?" Kim asked.
"Not malicious. Just direct to the point of being uncomfortable. He doesn't engage in pleasantries or small talk. He has no interest in office politics or relationship building."
"Sounds delightful," Luc muttered.
"I can vouch for his character. He's not cruel or unkind. He simply doesn't see the point of social conventions. Try not to take it personally."
"We'll manage," Max said. "If you trust him, that's enough for us."
"As long as he pulls his weight, I don't care if he never says hello," Kim added.
"That's the attitude I'm hoping for. Give him space to work his way. He'll demonstrate his value quickly."
Ray Shore arrived at nine thirty. He was tall and solidly built, with shoulder-length black hair that looked hastily combed. His suit fit properly but somehow still managed to appear rumpled. His expression was almost bored. He would have been handsome if he'd shown any animation at all.
Ian met him at the door. "Ray. Good to see you."
"Ian." Ray's tone was flat.
"Let me show you around."
Ian introduced Ray to the team one by one. Ray made no attempt at conversation. He didn't smile. He barely looked at anyone directly. When Ian finished the introductions, Ray immediately claimed the desk furthest from everyone else.
Kim brought over his new equipment. Ray took it without a word of thanks and started setting everything up. Within minutes he was clicking through files, completely absorbed.
At noon, the team headed out for lunch at a nearby seafood restaurant. Ray remained typing at his desk.
"Should we invite him?" Zoe asked.
"I don't think he'll come. But someone should ask," Max said.
Luc walked over. "We're heading to lunch. Want to join us?"
Ray didn't look up from his screen. "No."
"Alright. See you later."
Ray said nothing. Luc returned and they left together.
At the restaurant, Ela ordered a shrimp dish and smiled broadly. "The weather is finally perfect. I've been waiting for this."
"The new hire is certainly interesting," Amy said.
"He's quiet," Luc said. "I'll give him that."
"If Ian brought him personally, he must be exceptional," Max said. "We'll just have to get used to his quirks."
Kim stabbed at his fish. "As long as he's competent, I don't care if he never speaks to us. Honestly, it might be refreshing."
Ela laughed. "You're terrible. But I agree. If he's as good as Ian says, maybe our overtime sessions will finally end."
Everyone perked up at that thought.
"That would be incredible," Zoe said.
"I'll happily tolerate any personality if it means reasonable hours," Luc said.
They ate their meals in better spirits. The sunshine streaming through the windows helped with the mood.
In the afternoon, Ray spent three hours in Ian's office. The door remained unlocked. Jay could hear every word from his desk.
Ray's questions were detailed and relentless. He demanded specifics about every aspect of their methodology, their data sources, their analysis frameworks. He challenged assumptions. He pointed out potential weaknesses. He showed absolutely no deference to Ian's position.
"That model is outdated," Ray said at one point.
"It serves our purposes," Ian replied.
"Barely. You should update it."
"We've considered that."
"Then why haven't you?"
"Resource allocation."
"That's a poor excuse."
Ian answered everything patiently. Jay was both impressed and slightly terrified. He'd never heard anyone speak to Ian so bluntly.
Finally Ray closed his notebook. "That covers the immediate concerns. I'll begin the portfolio analysis tomorrow."
"Thank you. Let me know if you need anything else."
Ray left the office without further comment. He returned to his desk, made some notes, then shut down his computer. At exactly four o'clock he picked up his bag and walked out.
Luc stared after him. "Did he just leave at four on his first day?"
"Apparently," Kim said.
"Bold."
The rest of the team began departing around five. Jay stayed longer. He had correspondence to finish and several reports to format. The office slowly emptied until only he and Ian remained. At six, Jay walked to Ian's office. Ian was reviewing documents, but looked up immediately.
"Yes?"
"I just wanted to ask about Ray."
"What would you like to know?"
"You mentioned you were classmates. Were you close?"
"Not particularly. We were civil, but not friends."
"What was he like back then?"
"Brilliant. Uncompromising. He was there on a full scholarship, top of the class in every subject that mattered. He had no patience for the social aspects of university life."
"Was he always this blunt?"
"Always. Most students from wealthy families found him insufferable. He made no effort to network or build relationships. He treated professors and fellow students with equal indifference."
Jay tried to imagine Ian in that environment. Ian, who must have been one of those wealthy students. "Did that cause problems?"
"Constantly. He made many enemies. People who could have helped his career later. He didn't care."
"Why not?"
"I don't think career advancement interested him. He studied because he enjoyed it, not because he wanted status or wealth. After graduation his employment history was erratic. Brilliant performance followed by sudden departures."
"Because of his personality?"
"Partially. He refused to participate in office politics. When management made decisions he considered stupid, he said so. Directly. That doesn't tend to lead to promotion."
Someone who valued competence over everything else, who couldn't be bothered with games or social niceties. It explained the bare-bones interactions today.
"Do you think he'll fit here?" Jay asked.
"I do. This team is full of people who care more about results than appearances. Amy, Max, Luc, all of them. They'll appreciate his abilities once they see them. And Ray will appreciate working somewhere that doesn't punish him for being himself."
"You really trust him."
"I trust his competence absolutely. And I know he's not malicious. Difficult, yes. Unpleasant, sometimes. But not cruel."
"Thank you for explaining," Jay said.
"Of course. If you have concerns about working with him, let me know."
"I don't have concerns. Just curiosity."
"That's understandable."
Jay returned to his desk and worked for another hour before heading home. On the metro, he thought about what Ian had said. Ray had been there at university with Ian. He'd seen Ian during those years when Ian was still one of the rich kids, before everything fell apart.
What had Ian been like then? More carefree, probably. Before all the wounds that shaped him into the man he was now. Before all the pain that carved him into someone so contained.
Jay wanted to know. He wanted to understand every part of Ian's history, every piece that made him who he was.
He wanted to ask Ray about it, but it was obvious Ray wasn't someone who would answer that kind of question. He barely spoke at all, let alone about personal matters.
Jay got off at his stop and walked through the park toward home. The evening was warm and pleasant. Birds still sang in the trees. The light was golden and soft.
He thought about Ian sitting in a university classroom, surrounded by wealthy peers, while Ray sat somewhere nearby, glaring at everyone with contempt. The image made him smile.
He unlocked his apartment and stepped inside. The space still felt new and wonderful. He made dinner, ate on the balcony, watched the river turn dark as the sun set.
His life was good. Better than it had any right to be. This was his home now. His space. And somehow, Ian was woven through all of it. His neighbour, his boss, his friend. The person Jay couldn't stop thinking about, no matter how hard he tried.
Scene 2
Work-life balance
The next morning Ray arrived at exactly eight o'clock. He said nothing to anyone, claimed his desk, put on headphones, and began working. His fingers moved across the keyboard, pausing occasionally. Otherwise he was motionless.
At noon, Luc approached his desk again. Ray pulled off one side of his headphones.
"Lunch?" Luc asked.
"No."
"You sure? We're trying a new place today."
"I'm sure. Stop asking. I won't join your lunch outings. Or any other outings."
"Fair enough. What about the company retreat later this month?"  
"Under no circumstances would I join a company retreat."  
"Got it. Message received."
Ray put his headphones back on. Luc returned to the group and they headed out together. At the restaurant, Luc recounted the conversation with obvious amusement.
"He told me to stop asking. Just like that."
"At least he's clear about his boundaries," Amy said.
"I couldn't help myself. I asked if he'd at least come to the company retreat this month."
"You didn't," Zoe said.
"I did. He looked offended. Said under no circumstances would he attend a company retreat."
Max laughed. "I can respect that level of commitment to solitude."
"It'll take some getting used to. But I suppose we just won't talk to him at all," Ela said.
"Seems that way. I'm fine with it," Kim said.
They ate their meals in good spirits. Ray's peculiarities were becoming a great source of entertainment.
Back at the office, the afternoon passed quietly. At five, most of the team began packing up. Jay remained at his desk, working through correspondence.
Ian appeared beside him. "No gym today?"
"Not today. The commute is too long now. Going all the way across the city twice in one evening isn't ideal."
"What will you do instead?"
"I'll still go on Saturdays. And I'm thinking about working out at home. I have the space now, and some equipment. Maybe I'll try running too. The area seems good for it."
"There are excellent routes near the river. I run there sometimes."
"Could you recommend some?"
"Of course. The path along the south bank is about five kilometres. There's also a loop through the park that's shorter but has more hills. I'll write them down for you."
"Thank you."
The rest of the week followed the same pattern. Ray arrived at eight and left at four. He ate lunch at his desk, leaving only for coffee and the bathroom. Occasionally he went to Ian's office for clarification, but otherwise worked independently. He seemed to be conducting an audit of their entire methodology, checking historical data and reviewing old models.
On Thursday, Ray sat next to Max for an hour. Jay couldn't help overhearing.
"Walk me through your portfolios," Ray said.
"What specifically do you want to know?"
"Everything. Start with your initial assessment."
Max explained. Ray asked follow-up questions. They were nuanced and detailed. Jay understood maybe half of what they discussed. The technical depth was beyond him.
Friday morning, Ray repeated the process with Amy. He sat beside her desk and worked through her portfolio management decisions from the past year. Amy responded with the same patience Max had shown, explaining her reasoning and providing documentation when requested.
In the afternoon, Ray went to Ian's office with a folder of notes. Jay could hear them through the open door.
"I've completed the initial assessment," Ray said.
"What did you find?"
"The core methodology is sound. There are inconsistencies in documentation and some classification delays, but nothing that compromises the analysis quality. I have recommendations for improvement."
"I'd like to hear them."
"Your sector rotation model needs updating."
"I'm aware."
"When are you planning to address it?"
"Next quarter."
"That's too late. You should prioritize it."
They discussed timelines, methodologies, implementation strategies. Ian gave Ray specific direction on which models to update and how to approach them. Ray took detailed notes.
When Ray returned to his desk, he typed frantically for the rest of the afternoon. At four o'clock exactly, he stood up and left.
Luc called after him cheerfully. "Have a great weekend, Ray!"
Ray didn't acknowledge him. The door closed.
Luc turned to Kim with a grin. "I'm going to keep doing that."
"Why?" Kim asked.
"It's funny."
The office gradually emptied. Jay stayed, as he had every evening that week. The backlog was mostly cleared now, but he was reluctant to leave early. He told himself it was to stay on top of correspondence, but really he just preferred being here while Ian was here.
At six, everyone else had gone. Ian emerged from his office and walked to Jay's desk.
"What are your impressions of Ray?" Ian asked.
Jay looked up. "I'm not sure yet. He's definitely a personality."
"That's diplomatic."
"We'll only know if he's a good match once he actually starts producing work. For now, he seems to believe strongly in work-life balance."
Ian laughed. "That's one way to put it. Ray refuses to work overtime. He expects to receive his contractual pay for his contractual hours, and not a second longer."
"That's unusual in finance."
"Very unusual. If there's too much workload, he considers that a management issue, not his problem."
"I can see how that wouldn't make him popular."
"I don't disagree with his philosophy. My own workaholism is unhealthy. The frequent overtime during busy periods is unreasonable. Perhaps having someone like Ray will help us improve."
"Maybe."
Ian leaned against the edge of Jay's desk. "I wanted to ask you something. Next week we're holding the final round of interviews for junior analyst positions. I'd like you to join me."
Jay stared at him. "Join you for interviews?"
"Yes."
"I don't have any hiring experience."
"I'll send you the CVs on Monday to review. These candidates will be doing many of the tasks you currently handle, so it seems reasonable to involve you in the selection."
"What tasks?"
"Printing, proofreading, basic formatting, document organization. The office-wide administrative work. You're supposed to be my personal assistant, not assist the entire department. Having dedicated junior staff will let you focus on more important responsibilities."
Jay felt his stomach twist. "I don't mind the administrative work."
"I know you don't. But it's not the best use of your abilities. This way the senior analysts can work more efficiently without constantly pulling you away from your primary duties."
"I see."
"We'll discuss it more next week. I just wanted to give you advance notice."
"Thank you."
Ian returned to his office. Jay sat at his desk, staring at his computer screen. Junior analysts to handle administrative work. Work that he did now. Work that made him useful to everyone, not just Ian.
He'd always been the junior before. The new hire. The inexperienced one. Now apparently he was senior enough to help hire people beneath him.
He packed his bag at seven and said goodbye to Ian. The ride home felt strange. At his apartment he ate dinner while his mind was elsewhere. On Saturday he took the metro across the city to his old gym. Rus greeted him at the entrance.
"You actually came back," Rus said.
"I said I would."
Halfway through the workout, Jay brought up the junior analyst situation.
"It's weird. I'm supposed to help interview them."
"Why is that weird?"
"I've never hired anyone. I don't know what I'm doing."
Rus laughed. "You're thirty, Jay. Almost thirty-one. This is natural progression."
"I don't feel ready."
"Nobody ever feels ready. You'll figure it out."
"What if I make a mistake?"
"Then you'll learn from it. Stop overthinking."
Jay completed his set in silence. Rus watched him with amusement.
"Before you know it, you'll be a director," Rus said.
Jay sent him a look. Rus burst out laughing and patted his back.
"Relax. You're doing fine."
At home that evening, Jay thought about what Rus had said. He was thirty years old. He'd been working at Turner & Associates for almost two years. He had his own apartment now, a permanent contract, a senior title. Of course he wasn't a junior anymore.
New life, new responsibilities. That was how it worked.
He went to his bookshelf and pulled out the leadership textbooks he'd bought months ago when he wanted to better understand Ian's work. He'd never read them properly, just skimmed through sections here and there.
Now he sat down and started from the beginning. Recruitment techniques, interview strategies, candidate evaluation. He read through Saturday evening and all day Sunday, absorbing as much as he could.
He wasn't going to make hiring decisions. Ian would do that. But he at least wanted to understand the theoretical framework. He wanted to be useful, not just present. By Sunday evening he'd filled a notebook with observations and questions. He felt slightly more prepared, though still uncertain.
Everything was changing. His responsibilities, his role, his understanding of where he fit in the company. He just had to keep moving forward, even when he didn't feel ready.
Scene 3
Interviews
During their morning briefing, Ian handed him a stack of files. Jay felt deeply uncertain. 
"These are the CVs for this week's candidates. Twenty in total. I wanted to give you some context before we begin. What we're looking for, what to watch for."
"Alright."
"All of these candidates are qualified on paper. They have the degrees, the grades, the technical knowledge. That's not what we need to evaluate."
"Then what do we evaluate?"
"Whether they'll be a good match for this team. This industry attracts sharks. People who are ruthless, calculating, willing to do anything to advance. I'm allergic to that sort of person."
Jay thought about his own hiring, about Leo's scheme, about how Ian had been burned before. "I understand."
"I don't expect saints. But I want people who aren't mercenary about life. People who care about more than just advancement and money."
"How do we tell the difference?"
"That's the difficult part. Everyone will try to make a good impression. We need to look past that impression and try to gauge how they actually operate. Kindness can be indistinguishable from manipulation. Bluntness is easier to trust than calculated charm. But the nastiest people are often the best at hiding behind a pleasant facade."
"That sounds impossible."
"It's challenging. Very few people are like Ray, who show their hand immediately and never hide who they truly are."
Jay opened the first folder. The CV inside was impressive. Prestigious university, excellent grades, internships at major firms. "These credentials are all better than mine."
"Credentials don't determine success here. Character does."
"I don't feel qualified to judge that."
"You will. Trust your instincts. Pay attention to how people present themselves, what they choose to emphasize, how they respond to unexpected questions. The interviews start at four this afternoon."
Jay spent day hour reviewing the CVs. Each one was more impressive than the last. Top universities, honours programs, relevant experience. He made notes on each, but his observations felt inadequate. He couldn't tell who would actually be good at the job.
At four o'clock, Ian collected him from his desk. "Ready?"
"Not really."
"You'll do fine."
They walked to a small conference room near the lobby. Jay recognized it immediately. This was where his own interview had taken place two years ago. He'd been terrified then, awed that he was even allowed inside this building. Now he sat on the opposite side of the table. The reversal felt surreal.
A woman from HR joined them. She was middle-aged, elegantly dressed, holding a tablet and several folders. Jay knew her name was Lea, but they never spoke before.
"Shall we begin?" Lea said.
The first candidate arrived at four. A young man, wearing a perfectly tailored suit. He confidently shook hands with everyone.
Ian gestured to the seat across from them. "Please, make yourself comfortable. Would you like water, coffee, tea?"
"Water would be great, thank you."
Jay poured water from the pitcher on the table and passed it across. The candidate thanked him with a bright smile.
Lea began with the standard questions. Background, education, previous experience. The candidate answered smoothly.
Ian took over with more specific questions. "Tell me about a time when you disagreed with a decision your supervisor made. How did you handle it?"
"At my previous internship, my supervisor wanted to use a particular risk assessment model that I felt was inappropriate for the client's portfolio structure. I prepared an alternative analysis and presented it privately. We discussed the merits of both approaches, and ultimately she decided to use a hybrid method incorporating elements of my suggestion."
"How did that make you feel?"
"I appreciated that she was willing to consider alternative viewpoints."
Jay wrote in his notebook: seems confident, answers well prepared.
The interview continued for twenty minutes. When the candidate left, Lea made notes on her tablet.
"Initial impressions?" Ian asked.
"Very polished. Perhaps too polished," Lea said.
"I agree," Ian said. "Jay?"
"He seemed nervous despite the confident delivery. His hands were shaking slightly when he drank the water."
"Good observation."
They saw three more candidates that afternoon. Each interview was similar. Jay took notes on each one, recording small details. One candidate talked too much. Another made consistent eye contact but never smiled.
By six they were finished. Four candidates, two hours total including discussion time. In Ian's office afterwards, Jay reviewed his notes. He'd written observations next to each name. Seems nervous. Talks excessively. Very composed. Self-assured, maybe too much.
"What are your impressions overall?" Ian asked.
Jay looked up. "Honestly? I have no idea who's best. The talkative one seemed the most competent, but also excessively self-assured. Apart from that, they all seemed very similar."
"I had the same impression. It's the first day, though. We'll see more variety as the week continues."
"Do you already have preferences?"
"I'm especially wary of people who appear too charming. I can't have that on my team."
Ian was completely serious, and Jay understood exactly where that reservation came from. He suspected he'd kept his own job partially because of how uncharming he'd been, but he didn't say that aloud.
Four candidates arrived each afternoon starting at four o'clock for the rest of the week. Jay had developed his own evaluation system. He paid attention to how they spoke about their previous workplaces, how they answered questions about failure, what they emphasized about themselves.
On Wednesday at five-thirty, a young woman entered the conference room. She wore glasses and old-fashioned bangs, dressed in a conservative suit that didn't quite fit properly. Her handshake was gentle.
"Thank you for this opportunity," she said.
Lea began the standard questions. The woman never rushed her answers.
"Why did you choose finance?" Ian asked.
"Family pressure, mostly. My parents both work in banking. They expected me to follow. I've done well enough in the coursework, but I've always struggled to fit in with the culture."
"What aspect of the culture?"
"The competitiveness. The aggression. Everyone seems to be fighting for position constantly. I find it exhausting."
"What are you looking for instead?"
"Somewhere I can do good work without politics. Somewhere that values competence over showmanship."
Jay wrote: modest, honest, struggling to fit in. He felt instant recognition. Not due to family pressure, but the difficulty fitting into a world that felt foreign.
Ian asked several more questions. The woman answered thoughtfully, occasionally mentioning her family or her pets. Jay marked her as his first choice.
On Thursday afternoon, one candidate made a dry joke that Jay found particularly funny. He had an awkward delivery and seemed uncomfortable with formal interview settings. Jay marked him as his second choice, though he recognized humour was probably a poor criterion.
On Friday came a woman in her thirties with short hair and a no-nonsense demeanour. Her CV showed military service followed by a career change.
"Why did you leave the military?" Ian asked.
"Incompatible work philosophies. I disagreed with command decisions that I felt prioritized optics over effectiveness. I was told to follow orders without question. That didn't work for me."
"So you chose finance?"
"More or less at random. I needed a second career. I finished my degree while working security jobs, then found positions at several firms. It turned out I was good at analysis."
She stood out among the younger candidates with more prestigious backgrounds. Jay marked her as his third choice. Her unusual path reminded him of his own indirect journey to this office.
By Friday afternoon they'd completed all twenty interviews. Ian and Jay gathered in Ian's office for the final discussion. 
Ian turned to Jay. "What do you think?"
"Three choices. The woman from Wednesday at five-thirty, the awkward man from Thursday afternoon, and the former military woman from today."
"Interesting selections. Why those three?"
"The first one was honest about struggling with the industry culture. The second had a sense of humour. The third had an unusual background and seemed uninterested in playing games."
"I selected the nervous man from Monday and the quiet woman from Tuesday. But my third choice would also be the former military candidate. The first two seemed harmless. Non-threatening. People who would do their work without causing problems."
Jay thought that was certainly a criterion, though a depressing one.
Ian continued. "But I've been thinking about my approach. I've been selecting based on who seems safest, least likely to cause trouble. That's defensive hiring."
"Is that wrong?"
"It's limiting. You selected based on who showed actual personality. That's probably a better strategy."
"You're the one with experience."
"And you're the one who works with everyone daily. You understand team dynamics better than I do. We'll hire your top two choices."
Jay felt panic spike immediately. "What if I'm wrong?"
"They're junior positions. It's common for new hires to quit within the first month. If they're not a good match, they'll leave and we'll try again."
"But—"
"I trust your judgement. Your observations throughout the week have been sound. Your instincts are good. You saw things I missed. Have more faith in yourself."
Jay stared at his notebook, face burning. "I just don't want to make a mistake."
"You won't. And if something goes wrong, it's my responsibility, not yours. I'm making the final decision. I simply happen to agree with your assessment."
"Alright."
"Lea will contact the selected candidates on Monday. They'll start in two weeks if they accept."
The meeting ended. Jay returned to his desk in a daze. Ian trusted him. Trusted his judgement enough to hire based on his recommendations. That should have felt good. It did feel good. But it also felt insufficient. As if the praise only highlighted something missing. Some gap between what Ian was willing to give and what Jay wanted to receive.
He packed his bag at seven and took the metro home. The whole journey he felt his face burning, Ian's words replaying in his mind. At his apartment, sat on the balcony despite the cool evening air, watching the river and thinking about Ian's confidence in him.
Why did it make him feel both happy and profoundly sad? He wanted this acknowledgement. He'd worked hard for it. But receiving it felt like looking across a distance he didn't know how to cross.
He went to bed early, and sleep brought dreams immediately. 
Jay dreamed about sitting across from Ian, about being valued and understood. He dreamed about things he couldn't let himself want while awake. When he woke Saturday morning, he felt hollowed out. The dreams had been vivid enough to feel real, leaving reality disappointing by comparison.
He made coffee and sat on the balcony wrapped in the burgundy blanket. The river flowed past, indifferent to his confusion. Somewhere twelve minutes away, Ian was probably awake too, following his strict schedule, living his controlled life.
Jay wondered if Ian ever thought about him outside of work. If he ever felt this ache of wanting something more than what they had. Probably not. Ian had been through too much to risk anything. And Jay was just his assistant.
Scene 4
Intrusive thoughts
Jay took the metro across the city to his old gym. Rus was warming up on the rowing machine.
"You're here early," Rus said.
"Couldn't sleep."
Jay moved to the weights, but his mind was elsewhere.
"Something wrong?" Rus asked.
"Ian made me choose the new hires."
"That's good, isn't it?"
"It feels like too much responsibility. What if I picked wrong?"
"You're overthinking this. Your boss trusts you. That's a positive thing."
"I just don't want to mess up."
"You won't. And if something goes wrong, that's not on you anyway. This is a good opportunity. You're finally living up to your potential."
"Maybe."
"Maybe nothing. I was worried about you staying at that job, but it seems like it was the right call after all. You're doing well."
"I suppose."
Near the end of his workout, Jay mentioned the gym search.
"I'm thinking of finding a place closer to home."
Rus sighed theatrically. "I'm surprised you still come here at all. You practically live on the Heights now."
"The Heights are much farther north," Jay grumbled.
"Sure they are. But seriously, I'm happy for you. You look better. You're thriving. The move and promotion seem to have taken your mind off that unrequited love situation at least."
Jay turned sheepish immediately. Love. The word had started to sound like a curse.
"Right," he said quietly.
Rus clapped him on the shoulder. "Keep your head up. Things are looking good."
After the gym, Jay spent the afternoon walking through his neighbourhood looking for alternatives. Every gym he found was aggressively upscale. Sleek equipment, pristine floors, staff in designer athletic wear. Everything looked expensive and fragile. He missed the rough atmosphere of his old gym, where nobody cared if you dropped weights or sweated on the machines.
He left each one feeling more disheartened. He didn't want to worry about breaking equipment or looking out of place.
In the late afternoon, he called his landlord to terminate his lease. The company dealt with rentals near the old town. To Jay's surprise, they wanted to meet next Wednesday to finalize everything.
"You have a three month notice period," the woman explained. "But the area is sought after. We'll find a new tenant quickly. Better to handle it now."
"Wednesday works fine."
Jay hung up feeling dazed. That was much faster than he expected. In the afternoon he called his mother.
"Jay! How are you?"
"Good. I wanted to tell you about the new apartment."
"Tell me everything!"
He described the space, the balcony, the neighbourhood. His mother made delighted sounds throughout.
"We have to visit. The children are already talking about it."
Jay heard his siblings chattering excitedly in the background.
"You're all welcome. Maybe in July? After my busy period at work ends."
"That's your birthday. We absolutely must have a party."
"It's a small apartment. Not really built for parties."
"Nonsense. We'll make it work. We absolutely must celebrate properly."
Tim's voice came through the phone, slightly muffled. "Tell Jay about my birthday!"
His mother laughed. "Your brother is turning eighteen in autumn. You have to come for that party."
"That's right in the middle of our busy season. I can't promise anything."
"You have to try."
"I'll do my best. And I'll send a proper gift regardless."
"You better," Tim said.
"Send photos of your new place!" Ema shouted from somewhere nearby.
"I will."
After the call ended, Jay spent an hour photographing his apartment. He captured the balcony view, the kitchen, the bedroom, the living space. Then he took pictures of the neighbourhood, the river path, the parks. Even his mediocre photography skills couldn't hide how charming everything was.
He sent the photos to his family group chat. Responses came immediately.
"It's beautiful!"
"You live THERE now??"
"The river view is incredible"
"When can we visit???"
Jay smiled at his phone. The enthusiasm was warming, even if it made him feel slightly fraudulent. This life still didn't feel entirely real.
But even the busy day couldn't distract him from thoughts of Ian. As evening approached, Jay filled the bathtub. The hot water relaxed his muscles but did nothing for his thoughts. He imagined what it would be like to be held by Ian. Would it be warm? Comforting?
He thought about the brief embrace they'd shared months ago. Jay hungover and vulnerable, Ian broken and honest, both of them desperate for comfort. He remembered Ian's firm frame, that deep lovely scent.
Jay closed his eyes. He knew he couldn't think these things, but his mind betrayed him anyway.
After the bath he went to bed feeling stupid. Nothing good would come from such foolish fantasies. Ian was his boss, his mentor, his friend. Someone who'd shown him extraordinary kindness and trust. These thoughts were inappropriate and pointless.
Jay wandered restlessly on Sunday. He explored the neighbourhood thoroughly, checking parks he hadn't visited yet, walking past gyms that were farther away and all equally unsuitable. He found a charming pier further north and sat watching the river for an hour, trying not to think about anything at all.
He didn't want to sit alone in his apartment with his thoughts. That felt dangerous.
Monday at work felt oddly normal. Work meant structure, purpose. Ray arrived at eight and disappeared into his headphones. The rest of the team went about their business. Jay focused on his tasks.
At six, after everyone else had gone, Jay walked to Ian's office. Ian looked up from his computer.
"Do you need something?"
"I wanted to ask about gym recommendations in the neighbourhood. The ones I found are all very upscale."
It was a legitimate question. But mostly he wanted a pretext to talk to Ian, to be near him.
"Ah. I'm probably not the best person to ask. I mostly work out at home. My trainer comes on Saturdays to monitor my form."
"You have a home gym?"
"Yes. It seemed practical."
"That makes sense."
"During summer I also swim laps in the pool at my apartment complex. The outdoor one."
The image hit Jay suddenly. The memory of Ian's tanned body from last year's company retreat pool party. Broad shoulders cutting through water. Wet hair. Droplets on skin.
Jay's face burned.
"I need to go," Jay said abruptly.
"Is something wrong?"
"Stomachache. I should head home."
"Do you need—"
"No. I'm fine. Sorry. See you tomorrow."
Jay fled before Ian could say anything else. He grabbed his bag and left the office, not looking back. He heard Ian say something else but didn't catch the words.
On the metro, he buried his face in his hands. What was wrong with him? It was a disproportionate reaction. Completely foolish. Ian would think he was insane.
At home, Jay collapsed on the couch and stared at the ceiling. He couldn't let his weird thoughts make their relationship awkward. He had to control himself better, but his mind kept wandering to inappropriate places, imagining things that would never happen, wanting things he had no right to want.
He went to bed early, determined to sleep away the confusion. Tomorrow he'd be normal. He'd stop reacting like an idiot every time Ian said something perfectly ordinary.
But as he lay in the dark, wrapped in the burgundy blanket, Jay couldn't stop himself from imagining that warmth. He couldn't stop himself from wishing for something more than what he had, even as he knew that wishing was pointless.
He fell asleep eventually, exhausted from fighting his own thoughts. His dreams were full of water and sunlight and someone just out of reach, no matter how far he swam.
Scene 5
Rescue
On Tuesday, Jay tried to compose himself better. When Ian appeared at his desk at nine, concern was evident on his face.
"How are you feeling?"
"Much better. I must have eaten something wrong yesterday."
"Are you certain?"
"Completely certain. It passed quickly."
Ian accepted this explanation, though reluctance showed in his expression. "Good. I'm glad you're alright."
"Was there something you needed?"
"Yes, actually. Both candidates accepted our offer. They'll start in June, along with the second senior analyst."
Jay smiled, though it felt strained. "That's wonderful."
"Are you sure you're feeling better? You look tired."
"I'm fine. Really."
"If you need anything, let me know."
"I will. Thank you."
Ian returned to his office. Jay turned back to his computer, relieved. Two weeks until the new hires arrived. Normally he'd be anxious about the change, about training new people and adjusting dynamics. But right now he was glad for the distraction from his troubling thoughts.
Ray had already grown into his place. He became a silent monolith at the far desk. Occasionally he consulted team members, but his interactions were always brief and strictly work-related. Jay still hadn't spoken to him once. Jay's administrative duties were completely outside Ray's scope of interest.
By Wednesday, the topic around the office was the upcoming retreat. They'd depart Thursday afternoon for three days at the resort.
Ian tried to convince Ray to attend.
"It would be good for team cohesion," Ian said.
"No," Ray replied without looking up from his screen.
"The location is quite nice."
"No."
"You wouldn't have to participate in activities."
"No."
Ian accepted the refusal with good humor. "Understood. We'll see you Monday then."
Ray returned to his work without further comment.
Jay watched the exchange with amusement. Ian and Ray's interactions were unlike anything he'd seen before. Ray's brusqueness would have seemed rude with anyone else, but Ian  never took offense or pushed too hard.
That evening Jay returned home and pulled out his largest suitcase, the one Ian had given him during their international trip. He opened it on his bed and began packing.
His clothes from last year's retreat were still perfectly appropriate. He selected two of his three-piece suits for any formal occasions. Resort wear for the evenings, newly bought casual clothes, gym clothes for hiking. Everything fit easily with room to spare.
This time he felt no anxiety about packing. Last year he'd worried constantly about having the right things, about fitting in, about making mistakes. Now he knew that with Ian there, he had nothing to worry about.
Apart from his own unreasonable thoughts.
But surely those were just a passing anomaly. He knew himself. He'd never been one to entertain idle fantasies, not in his whole almost thirty-one years of life. This wouldn't be an exception.
He closed the suitcase and set it by the door, ready for Thursday.
Ian sat in his apartment Wednesday evening, reviewing retreat arrangements on his tablet. Everything was confirmed. Transportation, accommodations, activity schedules. All the logistics were handled.
But his mind kept returning to Monday. Jay's sudden departure, the unconvincing excuse about a stomachache. The way he'd looked flushed and uncomfortable before fleeing.
Ian hoped he hadn't pushed too hard with the recruitment responsibilities. He'd really believed Jay's instincts were sound, that involving him was the right choice, but maybe it had been too much pressure.
He wanted the new hires to work out specifically because of Jay. He wanted them to take over Jay's more tedious duties so Jay would have more time. More time to spend with him.
Ian had been bitter about the missed opportunities over the past year. All those evenings they should have been spending together in the lounge, but instead were drowning in unreasonable workload. All those moments stolen by busy seasons and overtime and constant demands.
He used to like his busy evenings. He'd arranged his entire life to ensure his evenings were full of work. He'd needed the distraction, needed something to fill the empty hours.
But now work was hindering him. And he'd worked hard to remedy that.
Recruiting Ray had been a calculated move. Ray had been working remotely for some obscure company on the New Continent after his last position ended spectacularly badly. Ian had sent Leo to track him down, intercept him, convince him to accept the job.
Leo had found him in a cramped apartment, working for minimal pay, and probably miserable despite his perpetual indifference.
"Never," Ray had said immediately when Leo explained the situation.
"Just hear me out," Leo had said.
"I don't do office politics."
"Ian knows that. He's offering you peace. Nobody will bother you. Regular hours, engaging work, good pay. You'll be left alone to do what you do best."
Ray had been skeptical. But Leo was persuasive, and eventually Ian had gotten on a call himself to make guarantees.
"You'll work your contracted hours and leave," Ian had said. "No expectations beyond competence. No social obligations. No games."
"Why would you want someone like me?"
"Because you're brilliant and reliable. That's more valuable than someone charming who causes problems."
It had taken three conversations before Ray agreed. But Ian had been certain it would be worth it. Ray's intellect was razor-sharp, better than Ian's own in many ways. He'd easily handle the heaviest workload from the senior analysts, freeing up everyone's time.
The second senior analyst had been hired through the standard process. She had excellent credentials, extensive experience, and impeccable references. Ian had been reluctant to authorize her hire anyway, his instincts warning against anyone too polished. But his integrity had won. She was objectively the best candidate among those he'd deemed acceptable.
At least she was happily married with three children. Ian didn't expect drama from that quarter.
The junior hires were wild cards. But juniors were easier to replace if something went wrong. They didn't need to be perfect, just acceptable enough to reduce workload and free up the evenings.
His evenings with Jay.
The retreat was just two days away now. Three whole days in close proximity to Jay. Breakfast and dinner, evening conversations, shared activities. Ian would make sure Jay was happy and comfortable, that he enjoyed every moment.
He wished they could share a room again as they had on the last retreat. But they'd have the second-best thing. Meals together, long talks, the boat trip where they'd be on the same small boat.
Ian had reviewed the activity details extensively. Six people per boat, which meant he and Jay would share with four others. Not ideal, but better than being separated. They'd have at least those few hours together on the water.
He'd make sure the retreat was special. That Jay had a good time, felt included and valued. That was what mattered.
Ian walked to his window. Twelve minutes south, Jay was probably packing, preparing for the same trip. Maybe sitting on his balcony, watching the same river that flowed past Ian's building.
So close. Yet the distance between them felt impossible to cross.
Ian had grown expert at suppressing his feelings, at maintaining perfect control. But lately that control felt fragile. Every smile from Jay threatened to crack it. Every shared evening made it harder to maintain the necessary distance.
Three days at the retreat. Ian would have to be careful. Attentive but not obvious. Helpful but not overbearing. He'd perfected this balance over the past year, but it never got easier.
Chapter 37: Thunderstorm
Scene 1
Pine woods
Ian arrived at Jay's building at exactly seven. He used his emergency key to access the entrance and parked in the underground garage. Jay was waiting by the elevator with his large suitcase.
"Good morning," Ian said.
"Morning. Thank you for this."
They loaded the suitcase into Ian's trunk and drove to the office together. The streets were quiet this early, the city still waking. Ian glanced at Jay in the passenger seat. He offered to pick Jay up the previous afternoon, and Jay had accepted without hesitation, without the anxious overthinking that used to come with such suggestions in the past. This was exactly what Ian had hoped for. Slowly and seamlessly blending their lives together
Late May remained chilly. The year continued to be rather cold. But for Ian, the spring was unusually beautiful this year.
The workday passed quickly. Everyone rushed to finish their tasks before the four o'clock departure. The office filled with luggage as people brought their bags in throughout the morning. Ela arrived with three suitcases, causing widespread amusement.
"Are you moving there permanently?" Luc asked.
"I need options," Ela said defensively.
At four everyone abandoned their desks and grabbed their bags. Kim carried his own suitcase and one of Ela's, but she still struggled with the remaining two. Everyone else was too loaded to help.
Ian had two massive suitcases. Jay managed his single suitcase and laptop bag. Zoe had one large bag and tried to help Ela, but couldn't manage both.
They were trying to reorganize when Ray picked up Ela's wandering suitcase and headed for the elevator. Everyone stared after him. Ray followed them to the waiting buses, set down the suitcase, and left without looking back.
Jay smiled to himself. Gruff but not unkind. Just as Ian had said.
The buses were different from last year. Only two instead of four, but these were brand new luxury coaches. Wood paneling, reclining armchairs, individual screens and climate controls. Definitely an upgrade. Jay felt secretly delighted. He'd get to sit next to Ian for six hours.
Staff loaded their luggage while everyone boarded. Jay claimed a seat next to Ian, who immediately offered him the window.
"You'll want to see the scenery," Ian said.
"Thank you."
The armchairs were enormous and comfortable. Individual separators gave each seat privacy. Jay immediately started pressing buttons, adjusting his seat up and down, testing the heating and air conditioning. He was still amazed by such displays of wealth.
Ian watched him with amusement. "Comfortable?"
"Very. This is incredible."
The bus departed with minimal delay. Outside, the sky was gray and threatening. Everyone had checked weather forecasts obsessively all week, but predictions kept changing. Current forecasts showed possible storms tomorrow.
Zoe leaned across the aisle. "I hope the weather clears."
"We'll have fun regardless," Amy said.
The drive would last six hours with a dinner stop at the halfway point. Jay turned to the window, watching the city give way to countryside. Bus staff dispensed refreshments. Coffee, tea, pastries. Jay accepted coffee.
"Have you spent much time in the mountains?" he asked Ian.
"Some. My family had a ski lodge when I was young."
"You mentioned skiing once before."
"We went every winter. A family tradition."
"Were you good at it?"
"Competent. My father insisted we all learn properly. He hired instructors every year."
"Did you enjoy it?"
"I did. It was one of the few times I felt truly free. Just the mountain and the speed. No expectations or protocols. We'd spend mornings on the slopes and afternoons by the fire."
"That sounds wonderful."
"It was. I haven't been back since I was eighteen."
Jay understood what he wasn't saying. Since he was disowned. Since his family cut him off and took everything away.
"Would you want to go back?" Jay asked.
"Perhaps. Someday. Have you ever been to the mountains?"
"No. I grew up in the south, but we never traveled much."
"You would have liked it. The air is different there."
"Maybe we could go sometime."
The words came out before Jay could stop them. He felt heat rise to his face, but Ian's expression didn't change.
"I'd like that," Ian said simply.
Jay asked more questions and Ian answered, describing the lodge, the slopes, the instructors who'd taught him. Despite the bus being full, the sound management was excellent. Everyone existed in their own small cocoon of space.
They talked the whole journey. Jay felt relieved that his strange thoughts from earlier in the week weren't making things awkward. This felt as good as always, sitting and talking with Ian, sharing stories and observations.
After three hours they reached the midpoint stop. A secluded restaurant built in traditional regional style, rustic but clearly expensive. Everyone was glad to stretch despite the comfortable bus.
The feast was impressive. Long wooden tables, huge portions of traditional food. Beer in enormous mugs, platters of ribs and game, roasted vegetables, fresh bread. Everyone ate and drank and relaxed into the evening.
Jay sat next to Ian with Luc on his other side. The beer was strong and the food was rich. Luc told increasingly absurd stories about previous company events. Everyone laughed.
The feast dragged on for over an hour. When they finally returned to the bus, Jay was exhausted. He reclined his seat fully. The motion of the bus was soothing and his eyes drifted shut. He woke briefly when the bus slowed, but couldn't make himself sit up. Sleep pulled him back under.
Ian watched Jay sleep beside him, fighting the urge to smooth the black hair that had fallen across his forehead. Jay looked peaceful, his face relaxed and soft. Beautiful.
They arrived at ten. Darkness had fallen completely, and light rain misted the windows. Thunder rumbled in the distance.
"Jay. We've arrived."
Jay woke up disoriented. "Already?"
"You slept for over two hours."
"Oh."
The resort was gorgeous. Modern buildings constructed from stone and dark wood, huge glass walls revealing warm interiors. Lights hung from trees, illuminating stone paths. Through the mist, they could see the lake rippling with rain.
They gathered their things and filed off the bus. Resort staff unloaded luggage. An elegant woman in a dark uniform handed out envelopes containing keys and guidebooks.
"Welcome to Pinewood Resort. Each department has a private lodge. Please follow the marked paths. If you need anything, the main building is always staffed."
She led them along a stone path to their lodge. 
"Your team has the entire Oakwood Lodge. The main floor has a common area with a fireplace, and there's a small kitchen if you need anything. Your rooms are upstairs. Breakfast is served in the main dining hall starting at seven."
Everyone claimed their rooms quickly. Ela and Kim took the largest room together, no longer bothering with pretence. 
Luc disappeared up a narrow spiral staircase at the back. "There's an attic room up here!"
Amy chose a spacious room with a balcony. Max and Zoe selected small rooms with lake views.
Jay and Ian took rooms next to each other facing the woods. Jay pushed open his door and found a cosy space with a large bed, a desk, and a window seat.
"This is lovely," he said.
Ian appeared in the doorway. "Your room is identical to mine. Looks comfortable."
"I'm exhausted."
"As am I. We should rest."
"Goodnight, Ian."
"Goodnight, Jay."
They disappeared into their rooms. Jay showered quickly and fell into bed. His last thoughts before sleep were of Ian in the room next door. Just a wall between them.
The rain intensified outside, drumming against the roof and windows. But inside the lodge was warm and dry, the fireplace crackling softly in the salon below.
Jay pulled the blanket up to his chin and smiled in the darkness. Three days here. Three days of activities and meals and conversations. Three days near Ian. He couldn't wait until morning.
Scene 2
Fragrance
Jay woke to the sound of heavy rain against his window. He checked his phone. Quarter past six. The weather forecast showed a storm incoming, expected to last most of the day.
He dressed in casual clothes and descended the stairs. The salon was quiet except for the crackling fire. Ian sat in one of the armchairs near the fireplace, tablet in hand, coffee cup on the side table.
"Good morning," Jay said.
Ian looked up. "Morning. Did you sleep well?"
"Very well. You're up early."
"Habit. Coffee's fresh if you want some."
Jay poured himself a cup from the pot on the counter and joined Ian by the fire. The warmth was welcome after the cool upstairs hallway.
"The weather is terrible," Jay said.
"Unfortunately, yes. I was just reviewing the schedule changes. All outdoor activities are cancelled. No paddle boats, no river rafting."
"That's a shame."
"Were you looking forward to them?"
"A little. But I wasn't too invested."
Ian scrolled through the screen. "The alternative activities are indoor. Fashion workshops, styling sessions, a fashion show tonight followed by dinner."
Jay made a face. "Not really my preference."
"Nor mine. But there are other options. Dancing workshops, yoga, various tastings."
"What are you planning to do?"
"I haven't decided yet."
Jay took the tablet and flipped through the digital pamphlet. Most of the fashion activities didn't appeal to him at all. He kept scrolling until something caught his attention.
"There's a scent workshop," he said, pausing on that entry.
"In the fashion corner, yes."
"I've always wanted to learn more about that."
Ian raised an eyebrow. "Really?"
"So I won't end up smelling like an overzealous teenager on their first date during some important occasion. I'm never sure what's appropriate."
Ian looked slightly surprised, but only for a moment. That was on point for Jay, worrying about violating subtle social norms he was unfamiliar with.
"Is that strange?" Jay asked sheepishly.
"Not at all. I'll join you."
Jay felt a surge of delight. "Really?"
"If you don't mind the company."
"Of course not. I'd like that."
They sat together watching the rain fall on the lake through the glass wall. The water was gray and choppy, the trees beyond swaying in the wind. It was beautiful in its own way.
Slowly other team members started descending from their rooms. Zoe appeared first, took one look at the weather, and groaned.
"This is terrible."
"Good morning to you too," Jay said.
"I wanted to do the hiking trail today. It's supposed to be spectacular."
"Maybe tomorrow," Ian said.
"Maybe." She poured herself coffee and collapsed into an armchair. "This is so disappointing."
The others trickled down over the next hour. Max arrived looking fresh. Amy appeared perfectly composed. Luc stumbled down at half past seven, clearly not a morning person. Ela and Kim were the last to emerge, just before eight.
"Still raining," Ela observed.
"All day according to the forecast," Kim added.
"Well, at least there are indoor activities."
Everyone gathered around the fire with their coffee, discussing options. 
"Well. No point in waiting for it to clear. Let's get breakfast," Luc said.
The resort had provided rain capes in a basket by the door. Everyone grabbed one and an umbrella from the stand. They made a soggy procession along the stone path to the main building, hunched against the wind.
The breakfast hall was still pretty empty. They loaded their plates with eggs and pastries and fresh fruit, then claimed a large table near the windows.
"Remember last year?" Luc said. "That beautiful seaside weather?"
"Uncommonly warm for the season," Amy agreed.
"Our weather luck ran out," Max said cheerfully.
Zoe just ate her eggs and continued looking miserable.
Eventually conversation turned to activities. Ela was determined to do everything fashion-related.
"All of it?" Kim asked.
"Every single workshop if possible. The styling, the makeup, the photo shoot, the show."
"I want nothing to do with any of that."
"You're not even a little curious?"
"Not even slightly."
They stared at each other. It was clear they weren't thrilled about separating. Originally everyone wanted water activities in the morning, then split up afterwards. But now everything had changed.
"I'll do all the fashion things. I don't mind," Amy said.
Ela brightened. "Really? Thank you."
Kim relaxed visibly. "What are the rest of you doing?"
"Modern dance workshop," Luc said immediately. 
"Disco music. Music from my youth," Max said.
"You're not that old," Luc said.
"I'm old enough to remember when disco was current. That makes me ancient."
"I like the retro vibe. I'll join you," Kim said. 
"Me too. Jumping around is better than moping about the rain," Zoe said without enthusiasm.
"What about you two?" Luc asked Jay and Ian.
"Scent workshop," Jay said.
"That sounds very sophisticated."
"It's practical," Jay insisted.
"Sure it is."
They finished breakfast and headed toward their various activities. Ela and Amy went toward the fashion corner, already discussing dress options. Kim, Luc, Zoe, and Max headed for the dance studio.
Jay and Ian followed the fashion corridor but turned into a smaller room labeled Scent Workshop. It was elegant and intimate, with white counters and rows of glass bottles. A pleasant older woman greeted them warmly.
"Welcome, welcome. First time exploring fragrance?"
"Yes," Jay admitted.
"Wonderful. Let me show you the basics."
She led them to a counter covered in bottles. "These are the building blocks. Top notes, heart notes, base notes. Each category serves a purpose."
She explained the theory while Jay listened intently. Ian already knew most of this but remained attentive, occasionally asking questions that drew out more detailed information.
"Now, let's explore what appeals to you," she said.
"I've always been curious about your scent. It's very distinctive," Jay admitted to Ian. 
"It's called Ambre du Solstice."
Jay repeated the name in his head several times to remember. "I've always been impressed by how rich and deep it is. But not overwhelming. Just warm."
"What do you prefer?" the woman asked Jay.
"Lighter, more fresh scents."
"Let's try some options."
She guided Jay through various scents. Mint and lemon and lavender and cedar. He smelled each, testing combinations, asking questions about composition.
"These are lovely," he said, holding up a mint and cedar combination.
"Very clean. Versatile for any occasion."
"Could I mix something similar?"
"Absolutely. Here, try this."
She set out several bottles and guided him through creating his own blend. Ian watched, giving occasional suggestions. They adjusted ratios, testing results.
"This is perfect," Jay said finally, smelling the result on his wrist.
"Let me try," Ian said.
Jay held out his wrist. Ian took his hand and brought it closer, inhaling deeply.
"Yes, that suits you very well."
Jay's heart was racing as he pulled his hand back.
"Now let's create something together. A shared scent, if you'd like."
"Together?" Jay asked.
"Why not? It's a lovely memento of your time here."
Jay looked at Ian. "Would you want to?"
"Yes."
They worked on it together, combining elements from both their preferences. The warm depth of Ian's choice with the fresh brightness Jay favoured. It took several attempts to balance properly.
"That's beautiful. Rich but fresh. Perfectly balanced."
Jay smelled it and grinned. It warm and clean and somehow exactly right.
"We'll take two bottles," Ian said.
She prepared them while Jay kept smelling his wrist. They had their own fragrance now. Something that belonged to both of them.
They left the workshop with their bottles. Jay was absolutely delighted, unable to stop smiling.
"That was wonderful," he said.
"I'm glad you enjoyed it."
"Did you?"
"Very much."
They went to a tea ceremony next to refresh themselves after all the smelling. The room was empty except for a young woman in traditional dress who welcomed them and guided them to cushions on the floor. She prepared tea with graceful movements. The ceremony was meditative, focusing on each small action. She served them in tiny cups, the tea fragrant and delicate.
The rain kept hitting the lake surface beyond the windows, creating rippling patterns. The room was warm and serene.
"We smell like a perfumery," Jay whispered.
Ian's mouth twitched. "Probably."
Jay kept smelling his wrist between sips, grinning each time. The scent was divine. When the ceremony concluded, the woman bowed and departed, leaving them alone in the room.
"Should we head back?" Ian asked eventually.
"I suppose we should."
They stood and made their way to the dining hall for lunch. The rest of the team was already there. Ela and Amy were dressed extravagantly in long, elaborate dresses with heavy makeup. The others wore sports clothes and were breathing heavily.
"How was dancing?" Jay asked.
"Exhausting. I'm too old for this," Max said.
"You kept up fine," Luc said.
"I'll be sore tomorrow."
"Worth it though. That was actually fun," Kim added.
They loaded their plates with herbal meat pies and cured meats. The food was good, regional and warming. Jay liked it well enough, though last year's tropical grilled skewers had been phenomenal.
He looked around the venue as he ate. The glass ceiling and walls gave an amazing view of the surrounding area, but the overcast skies and rain made it look vaguely foreboding. Thankfully the food and jovial atmosphere mitigated the unfriendly aura outside.
Soon everyone finished eating and departed to prepare for their afternoon activities. Jay and Ian walked back through the rain to their lodge, umbrellas barely keeping them dry. Inside, the fire was still burning. They stood near it, drying off.
Jay smelled his wrist again. He couldn't stop smiling.
Scene 3
Fashion
Jay and Ian grabbed their evening clothes from the lodge and returned to the main building. Better to change there than risk getting their formal wear wet walking back and forth. The fashion area included numerous changing rooms and styling stations. Staff moved between them with clothes and accessories. Music played in the background.
Jay went to the changing room to get dressed. His blue three-piece suit fit perfectly. He fastened the sapphire cufflinks Ian had given him, then the matching tiepin. The effect was striking. He looked like a prince.
Jay stepped out and found Ian waiting, dressed in a slate gray three-piece suit. They had both applied their shared scent. Jay caught the fragrance as Ian approached and smiled.
"You look excellent," Ian said.
"So do you."
They moved toward the styling area. The rest of their team was scattered throughout, in various states of preparation. Some were still arriving. Others were already fully dressed and posing for photographers.
A stylist approached Jay immediately. She looked him up and down with an approving expression.
"Perfect. Absolutely perfect. We'll just need some minor hair adjustments."
"Thank you."
She gestured to a hairdresser. "Take him to station three. Classic style."
Before Jay could respond, two other stylists descended on Ian.
"No, no, no. You absolutely cannot show up to the party looking like this."
"I beg your pardon?" Ian said.
"Trust us. We have a vision."
They whisked Ian away before he could protest. Jay watched him disappear into a private styling room, looking resigned. He suppressed a smile as he allowed himself to be led to the hairdresser.
The process took less than twenty minutes. The hairdresser worked efficiently, creating an old-fashioned style that made Jay look distinguished. When she finished, he thanked her and wandered back into the main area.
Luc appeared at one point looking like a movie star from a spy film. Perfectly tailored tuxedo, slicked-back hair, an air of dangerous charm.
"How do I look?" he asked, striking a pose.
"Like you're about to order a martini," Jay said.
Kim and Ela emerged together, both wearing opulent outfits with elaborate accessories. Their ensembles matched, coordinated in deep burgundy and gold.
"You two look incredible," Jay said.
"We know," Ela replied happily.
Amy wore a long flowing dress with sparkling diamond jewellery. She looked timeless, like she'd stepped out of a classic film. Zoe eventually appeared in extremely high heels and a short seductive dress, looking quite amused by the result.
"These shoes are death traps," she said.
"You look amazing though," Jay replied.
"I know. It's worth the pain."
Max arrived dressed like old royalty, all velvet and brocade. He looked both magnificent and slightly ridiculous.
"Don't say a word," Max warned.
Jay grinned. "You look very refined."
"I look like I'm attending a coronation."
"That too."
Jay kept glancing toward the private styling room where Ian had disappeared. Nearly two hours had passed. What were they doing to him?
Finally, the door opened.
Ian emerged, and Jay forgot how to breathe.
The outfit was completely unlike anything Ian would ever choose. A top that was far too tight, showing every line of his athletic build. An asymmetrical jacket draped over one shoulder. A long scarf in bold colours draped loosely around his neck. Skintight pants that left absolutely nothing to the imagination. Tall boots that added another few centimetres to his already imposing height.
It had no right to look as good as it did. But Ian's natural musculature and perfect proportions somehow made it work. He moved with complete confidence, as if he wore this sort of thing every day.
"Well?" Ian asked, approaching Jay.
"You look incredible."
"This is definitely not what I would have picked myself."
"But it works."
"Does it?"
"Yes."
Leo appeared from somewhere, wearing what looked like several furs stitched together with gold chains in bizarre places. He took one look at Ian and burst out laughing.
"Oh, this is perfect. Absolutely perfect."
"You really have no right to laugh at anyone, looking like you robbed several grandmas and stole their prized foxes from before the war."
"These are vintage pieces."
"They're ridiculous."
"So are those pants."
"At least I look good."
Leo grinned. "You do. I hate to admit it, but you do."
The staff began herding everyone toward where the fashion show would take place. Jay walked beside Ian, very aware of how different they looked. His own classic suit contrasted sharply with Ian's avant-garde outfit. They filed into a large hall with rows of seating facing a raised runway. Jay sat next to Ian.
The show began with dramatic music and lasted maybe two hours. The host presented collections from designers Jay had never heard of. Models walked the runway in elaborate creations, some beautiful, some bizarre. Ela nodded knowingly every now and then, discussing something animatedly with Amy in hushed voices. Jay had no idea what was happening, but at the very least most of the outfits looked presentable.
When the show finally ended, staff directed everyone to a photography area, where photographers had set up backdrops and lighting.
"Individual shots first," someone announced. "Then groups."
Jay posed awkwardly, unsure what to do with his hands. The photographer gave him direction and he did his best to follow. The results, when shown on the screen, were surprisingly good.
Ela and Amy were absolutely delighted with their photos. Kim looked pleased. Even Zoe couldn't complain, holding an old-fashioned cigarette pipe and pretending to smoke like the fancy socialites from the prewar era.
The group photos were chaotic but fun. Their entire team crowded together, then individual departments, then random combinations. Jay ended up with a folder full of images by the time they finished.
"These are fantastic," Ela said, flipping through hers.
"Very glamorous," Amy agreed.
By the time they were done, evening had fully arrived. Staff directed them toward the dinner hall.
The space was enormous. Glass walls and ceiling stretched overhead. Lights floated in midair, suspended by invisible wires. The storm had intensified. Lightning illuminated the sky in dramatic flashes, visible through the transparent roof. Thunder rolled constantly, deep and ominous.
The theme was old time cinema. Everyone remained in their glamorous outfits. Staff circulated with trays of champagne, caviar, lobster. A live band played vintage music in the corner.
It was completely different from last year's refined elegance. This was playful and dramatic, enhanced by the violent weather outside.
Jay grabbed a glass of champagne and wandered between tables. People laughed and showed each other photos from earlier. Some danced to the band's music.
Jay kept looking for Ian. Every time he spotted him across the room, his heart skipped a beat. Ian looked so different in that outfit, but he owned it completely. He could have been a model with how naturally he presented himself. Jay knew he was staring. He tried to be discreet and failed completely.
The evening progressed through multiple courses. More champagne appeared. The band played faster songs and more people danced. Lightning continued to flash overhead, adding to the atmosphere.
Finally, late in the evening, Jay found Ian in a relatively secluded corner. The party was still going strong, but this section was quieter.
"Are you enjoying yourself?" Ian asked.
"Very much." Jay moved closer, catching their shared scent on Ian. He smiled. "You look great."
"Thank you. Though I have to say, this outfit is excruciatingly uncomfortable."
"Really?"
"The pants are far too tight. And I'm fairly certain the boots have given me a blister."
Jay laughed. "We could excuse ourselves. It's already after dessert. There really isn't any reason to stick around. I can pretend to be super drunk and you can escort me again."
"That's a brilliant idea."
They approached their team's table. Ian put a hand on Jay's shoulder.
"I'm taking Jay back to the lodge. He's had enough to drink."
"Already?" Luc asked.
"And I need to get off these pants as soon as possible," Ian added.
Everyone laughed. Ela waved them off.
"Go, go. We'll see you tomorrow."
They grabbed coats and umbrellas at the entrance, but the rainfall was absolutely insane. Even with protection, they were quite wet by the time they reached their lodge.
Jay undressed in his room, hanging his suit properly so it would dry without damage. He heard Ian moving around next door, presumably removing his cursed fashion outfit with much less care.
They both showered and changed into pyjamas, then reconvened in the living room. The fireplace still burned warmly. Ian retrieved a bottle of wine from somewhere and two glasses.
"To commemorate our successful fashion debut," he said.
Jay laughed and accepted a glass. They sat together on the sofa, close enough that Jay could still catch hints of their shared scent. Outside, the storm raged violently. Wind howled. Rain hammered the windows. Thunder shook the building. Inside, everything was warm and comfortable.
"It's not fair," Ian said after his first sip of wine.
"What isn't?"
"I had to dress up as a clown while you were left alone looking dignified."
Jay grinned. "It was definitely Leo's doing."
"Obviously."
"I can't believe you stay friends with someone who clearly wishes you ill."
"He doesn't wish me ill. He just enjoys chaos."
"Same thing."
"He wasn't always like this. When we were in college together, he was quite different."
"Really?"
"He was younger, in an earlier year. Quite awkward. Our families knew each other, so I took him under my wing. I mentored him through the social aspects of university life."
Jay tried to imagine Leo as an awkward teenager and failed. "I can't picture that at all."
"He was very earnest. Tried too hard to fit in. Made terrible jokes that nobody laughed at."
"And now you're stuck with him."
"I am. Though I admit, life is rarely boring with Leo around."
Jay sipped his wine, watching the fire. "I always thought rich people were naturally worldly and polished. That they never had awkward phases."
"Everyone has awkward phases. Wealth doesn't prevent that."
"I suppose not."
They talked until almost one in the morning, about the day's activities, the ridiculous fashion show, the photos they'd taken. Ian told more stories about Leo's college years, each one more absurd than the last. Jay shared memories from his own university days, the dormitories and terrible cafeteria food.
The wine disappeared slowly. The fire burned down to embers. Outside, the storm continued its assault. Finally, reluctantly, they got up.
"We should sleep," Ian said.
"Probably."
They walked upstairs together. At their adjacent doors, they paused.
"Today was wonderful," Jay said.
"It was. Sleep well."
"You too."
Jay entered his room and got into bed. Late-night talks with Ian over drinks were definitely the best thing in the world.
Scene 4
The Green Fairy
Jay's alarm went off at six thirty. He'd only managed about five hours of sleep, but he silenced it immediately and got out of bed. He wouldn't miss morning coffee with Ian for anything. He dressed in casual jeans and a comfortable shirt, then headed downstairs. Ian was already there. A fresh pot of coffee sat on the side table.
"Good morning," Ian said.
"Morning." Jay poured himself a cup and joined Ian on the sofa. "Do you always wake up this early?"
"I wake at five thirty most days."
"Every day?"
"I normally sleep six hours, but I can function on four if necessary. At least for a few days."
"I've never been good with little sleep."
"It's something I've always done. Even when I was younger."
Jay sipped his coffee, waiting for the caffeine to work its magic. Five hours definitely wasn't enough for him, but this serene rainy morning with Ian, before the chaos of the day began, was worth the sacrifice.
Slowly, the rest of the team came down. Each one looked worse for wear after yesterday's partying. Zoe looked absolutely miserable. "It's still raining."
"Maybe it'll clear later," Max said.
"It's not going to clear. This whole retreat is ruined."
"We're making the best of it."
"I wanted to do the trail hike."
"I know."
Luc dropped onto the sofa with a heavy sigh. "The horseback archery is cancelled too. I checked the schedule."
"How can you even think about archery right now? My head is killing me," Ela asked.
"I'm resilient."
They eventually rallied enough to make the walk to breakfast. The rain was lighter than yesterday, and they arrived mostly dry. The breakfast hall was busy. Jay loaded his plate and found a seat. The food helped, though he still felt tired.
After breakfast, Leo appeared and announced a grand cook off.
"Originally an outdoor party was supposed to happen in a charming grove. With team sports. But that's cancelled. Instead, each department sends a team of four to prepare lunch dishes."
Murmurs spread through the hall.
"You'll have access to our kitchens and ingredients. The winning team receives a mystery prize!"
Leo looked positively gleeful. Ian immediately looked suspicious.
"I'm volunteering," Luc said instantly.
Jay remembered the absolutely awful breakfast Luc had once prepared him. "Can you even cook? Because it didn't seem that way."
"Not at all. I never cook. But I like a challenge."
"That's a terrible reason to volunteer."
Amy shook her head. "I never cook either. I'm definitely passing."
Kim and Ela exchanged amused looks. "We're definitely not very good."
"I have some experience. I can help," Max said.
"It's not my favourite activity, but I feed myself regularly, so I won't burn everything," Zoe added.
Ian and Jay exchanged glances. Jay grinned shamelessly. They were absolutely going to win this.
"Ian and I volunteer," Jay announced. "We need to keep the record of winning team activities."
Ian raised an eyebrow but didn't object.
Leo clapped his hands. "All teams, report to the kitchens in one hour. You'll have twenty minutes to plan your menu, then three hours to prepare at least four distinct dishes."
They made their way to the kitchen area. Multiple cooking stations had been set up, each with full equipment. Other departments were already gathering, looking various degrees of confident and terrified.
Leo stood at the front wearing an absurdly enthusiastic expression, like he'd personally won some prestigious award. Ian's suspicion deepened.
"Welcome, competitors! Your ingredient selection is over there. Plan wisely. Cooking begins at exactly eleven o'clock."
Ian immediately took charge. He did the most crucial tasks himself with absolute mastery, to everyone's great surprise. Except Jay, who just smiled and followed his orders. He didn't admit to having done this before, but he was quite confident in their cooperation.
Zoe and Max did the chopping, washing, peeling, stirring. Ian coordinated everything while frying simultaneously.
"Start the vegetable stock," Ian told Jay. "Exact measurements. I'll prep the fish."
The other teams struggled in various ways. IT was consistently the fastest to finish each dish, but their presentations were sloppy. Accounting produced surprisingly good food but nowhere near Ian's level. Legal tried very hard, but the results were subpar across the board.
Jay stirred the soup while watching Ian sear the fish. His movements were confident. This wasn't someone who occasionally cooked. This was someone with serious training.
The dishes came together beautifully. The soup was velvety. The fish was crisp on the outside, tender inside, with herb butter that elevated everything. The roasted vegetables were caramelized and sweet.
They plated everything and delivered it to the serving area. Other team members gathered to sample the various dishes.
The reactions to Ian's team were immediate and enthusiastic.
"This is restaurant quality," someone from accounting said.
Ela tried the soup and looked stunned. "Ian, this is incredible."
Kim sampled everything. "You're wasted in finance. You should open a restaurant."
Lunch that day was complete chaos, but elicited many laughs.
The final results were announced after everyone had eaten. Ian's team won by a huge margin. Their department would receive a mystery prize at the retreat's conclusion.
Ian had a very bad feeling about it.
The afternoon involved multiple concerts to choose from. Everyone went back to change into evening clothes. Jay wore his second three piece suit. He met Ian in an equally polished outfit.
"At least you don't have to suffer tight trousers this time," Jay said.
"Thank god for that."
They reviewed the afternoon schedule. Multiple concerts were available. Electronica, pop, alternative rock, and classical chamber music.
"The string quartet looks interesting," Ian said.
"You want to go to that one?"
"If you're interested."
"I am."
Most of their team departed for either the electronica or pop concerts. The classical venue was small and intimate. Plush chairs faced a small stage. Only about twelve people attended, making it the least popular option by far.
Jay and Ian found seats near the middle. The string quartet entered and took their positions. The music began immediately. It was beautiful. Serene and calming, occasionally haunting. The strings wove together in complex harmonies that filled the space.
But Jay mostly watched Ian.
Ian looked positively beaming. He sat with his eyes closed, completely absorbed in the music. His expression was tranquil, more relaxed than Jay had ever seen him. It was a beautiful sight.
The concert lasted about an hour. When it ended, Ian opened his eyes slowly, as if returning from somewhere far away.
"Did you like it?" Ian asked.
"I loved it," Jay said honestly.
The music had been pleasant enough. But it was simply a backdrop to the more heartfelt display he'd just witnessed.
Dinner was themed around global cuisine. Chefs from various southern countries presented their national dishes. The food was rich and unusual, with flavour profiles Jay had never experienced before. Some were quite bold.
Kim was absolutely delighted. "This is incredible. The organization of this event is spectacular."
Afterwards, a disco was organized. The entire team went. Jay and Ian lasted maybe fifteen minutes in the noise and lights before they fled after exchanging miserable glances. Way too loud. They didn't even excuse themselves, just escaped back to their lodge.
"That was unbearable," Jay said once they were outside.
The rain had finally stopped. The air was cold but fresh. They reached their lodge and sat on the sofa. The fireplace still burned warmly.
"There are alternative activities. Movie viewings, spa packages, board games," Ian said.
"Do you want to do any of those?"
"Not particularly."
"Would you be interested in trying something different?"
"What kind of different?"
"Come upstairs. I'll show you."
Jay followed Ian up to his room. Ian opened his suitcase and pulled out a dark green bottle along with several implements Jay didn't recognize.
"Absinthe. It was popular in certain circles during the early previous century. I acquired an authentic bottle by chance."
Jay examined the bottle. The label was old-fashioned and elaborate. "I've heard of it. Never tried it."
"We might as well try now. There's an entire drinking ritual involved."
"A ritual?"
"I'll show you."
He began preparing the drinks. First, he poured a measure of the green liquid into each glass. Then he placed the slotted spoon across the rim and set a sugar cube on top.
"Now we add cold water. Slowly, over the sugar."
He picked up a bottle and began dripping water over the cube. It dissolved gradually, the sweetened water falling into the absinthe below. The liquid began to cloud. The process was almost meditative. Ian moved through the steps like the tea ceremony they'd attended earlier. Jay watched, fascinated, then took the glass and sniffed cautiously. It smelled herbal, with undertones of anise. He took a small sip. The taste was mouth numbing and intensely medicinal. Definitely distinct.
"What do you think?" Ian asked.
"It's unusual. Strong."
Jay leaned back against the headboard, feeling the alcohol work through his system. "This feels decadent."
"That is the idea. Alcohol is a dangerous vice, but it's brilliant at creating exactly this atmosphere. Dreamy, almost mystical."
"I can feel it already."
Ian prepared another round. The water dripped slowly over the sugar cube. The liquid clouded.
"I'm glad you look better now," Ian said quietly, not looking up.
"Better?"
"Earlier this year, there was a time when I was terrified. I thought I'd pushed too hard. Pushed everyone too far. I was scared you would finally break."
"You were worried about me?"
"Very worried. I'm glad things are moving in the right direction. That this retreat is going relatively well."
Jay laughed, feeling mellow and floaty. "Yeah, it was difficult. I wanted to run away."
Ian looked up sharply. "You did?"
"A lot of little things happened at the same time. Made me doubt my place in the world. Made me believe I should return to where I belonged. A gray and unassuming existence."
"Jay..."
"When things go poorly, I spiral. I can't control it. I just sink deeply into misery. And I know things will go badly again. I'll feel miserable again. That's why I wanted to run. Because even though I know this misery will pass, it still terrifies me to go through it."
"It shouldn't be this difficult. It's my fault."
"It isn't. Things just sometimes go badly. I know I'm being ridiculous. There's no guarantee things will go well elsewhere. But somehow in this world, failures feel more monumental. Like I'm not just failing at a task, I'm proving I don't belong."
"That's not true."
"I know. Logically, I know. I have to work on it, not run away. And I'm glad I didn't, because I've never been happier."
Ian slowly prepared another round. The absinthe made everything feel soft and strange. Jay moved from the bed to sit on the floor, leaning against the side of the mattress. Ian stayed in his chair, preparing drink after drink.
"The green fairy. That's what they called it."
"Why?"
"Hallucinations. Supposedly. Though that was probably just the alcohol content."
"Are we going to hallucinate?"
"Probably not. But we're definitely getting drunk."
Jay laughed. The room became dreamlike. At some point Jay ended up sitting on the bed again, though he couldn't remember moving. 
Ian squinted at the bottle. "How much have we drunk?"
"A lot."
"We should probably stop."
But neither of them moved. Ian prepared another round. He was sloppy now, water spilling, sugar dissolving too fast. But they drank anyway.
"I'm really drunk," Jay announced.
"Me too."
Jay laughed so hard he nearly spilled his drink. Everything was hilarious. The room spun gently. Jay wasn't sure when he closed his eyes. But at some point he let himself drift. The last thing he remembered was Ian's voice saying something he couldn't quite make out, and the feeling of being exactly where he belonged.
Scene 5
Spa treatments
Jay woke to blinding pain. His head felt like it was splitting open. Every muscle ached. He opened his eyes slowly and immediately regretted it.
He was lying on a bed. Not his bed. Ian's bed. He was still fully dressed. His jacket lay crumpled on the floor beside Ian's. The empty absinthe bottle sat on the desk.
Ian lay beside him, perfectly still, eyes closed. His face was pale and drawn.
"Ian?" Jay whispered.
"Yes."
"Are you alive?"
"Debatable."
Jay tried to sit up and the room spun violently. He fell back against the pillows with a groan. "What time is it?"
Ian opened one eye and looked at his watch. "Seven thirty."
They lay there in mutual misery. Jay's head pounded with every heartbeat. He'd never had a hangover this severe. His stomach rolled dangerously. He swallowed hard, trying to keep everything down. "I'm going to die."
"You're not going to die."
"I might."
"You won't."
Ian sat up slowly, moving like everything hurt. His hair was disheveled, his shirt wrinkled. He looked as terrible as Jay felt.
"We need water," Ian said. He swung his legs over the side of the bed, got up and made his way to the bathroom. Jay heard the tap running, then Ian returned with two glasses and a bottle of painkillers. He handed one to Jay.
"Sit up slowly," Ian instructed.
Jay obeyed, moving with excruciating care. The room tilted. Ian handed him water and pills. Jay swallowed them gratefully. He looked toward the window. Bright sunshine streamed through. The sky was blue and clear. After two days of rain, it was almost offensive.
"Everyone will be hiking," Jay said.
"Probably."
"We can't go."
"Definitely not."
"What should we do?"
"The spa is available. We could spend the morning there."
"Sounds reasonable."
"We should probably get cleaned up first," Ian said.
"I should go to my room."
"Can you walk?"
"I'll manage."
Jay got up clumsily. The room tilted but he stayed upright. He retrieved his jacket from the floor and made his way to the door.
"Jay," Ian said quietly.
"Yes?"
"I'm sorry. This is my fault."
"It's not. We both made terrible decisions."
Jay returned to his room and collapsed onto the bed, his heart still pounding, not from the hangover, but from the memory of waking beside Ian. They’d spent the night together, if only because he’d been too drunk to move. And even now, aching and half-alive, he couldn’t bring himself to mind. The misery felt almost sweet for having happened in Ian’s company.
An hour later, Jay felt marginally better. He'd showered and changed into clean clothes. His head still throbbed, but less violently. He went down to the empty living room. Everyone else had already left for breakfast and activities. Ian appeared shortly after. He'd changed into slacks and a sweater.
"Ready?" Ian asked.
"As I'll ever be."
They made their way to the spa building. It was dim, with meditative music playing. The staff welcomed them and led them to a relaxation room with heated loungers. Jay lay down gratefully. The warmth seeped into his aching muscles. Someone brought them cucumber water and cool cloths for their faces.
"This was the right choice," Jay muttered.
Ian lay on the next lounger, eyes closed. Even hungover and exhausted, he looked good. Jay watched him for a moment before closing his own eyes. They were spending another morning together. Recovering from their terrible decisions, but together nonetheless.
Eventually the staff came to offer massages. Jay's massage therapist worked magic on his tense shoulders and back. By the time it ended, he felt mostly recovered. They reconvened in the relaxation room, both looking better.
"I think I might survive," Jay said.
"I believe you will."
"Should we attempt lunch?"
"We should try."
They made their way to the dining hall. Most people were already there, energetic from their outdoor activities.
"There you are! We were worried," Ela called.
"We weren't feeling well this morning," Ian said.
"Too much wine last night?"
"Something like that."
Food was laid out buffet style, but Jay stuck to plain rice and steamed vegetables. Ian chose similarly safe options. The rest of the team looked happy and refreshed. Zoe was particularly excited, having finally gotten to do her trail hike.
"It was spectacular. The views were incredible. You should have come."
"Next time," Jay said weakly.
After lunch, Leo stood and called for attention. He looked far too pleased with himself.
"As promised, we have a mystery prize for the winning cooking team!"
Ian looked deeply concerned.
"The finance department will receive an all-expenses-paid weekend trip to the thermal springs resort! Hot springs, mineral baths, mountain views. A perfect getaway."
Everyone cheered. Kim and Ela looked delighted. Even Zoe smiled.
"When is this trip?" Ian asked.
"To be scheduled at your convenience."
"That's very generous."
"Only the best for our champions. I hope you all enjoy it."
Ian looked like he suspected a trap but couldn't identify it yet.
After lunch, they returned to their lodges to pack. Jay folded his suits and organized his belongings. Everything fit back nicely into his suitcase. He stood in his room for a moment, looking around. They'd been here only three days, but it felt longer. So much had happened.
He went downstairs with his luggage. The rest of the team trickled down gradually. The buses arrived at two o'clock. Staff loaded luggage. Everyone boarded and found their seats.
Jay claimed the same spot as before, window seat with Ian beside him. The buses pulled away from the resort, beginning the long journey home.
The weather was beautiful now, bright and clear. Through the windows, Jay could see the mountains properly. They were stunning, all green forests and gray stone peaks.
"It's beautiful," Jay said.
"It is. A shame we couldn't see it earlier."
"At least we got one nice day."
The bus rolled smoothly along mountain roads. People chatted or dozed. Jay turned to look at Ian. He'd reclined his seat and closed his eyes.
Three days together. Cooking, concerts, drinking too much absinthe. Waking up in Ian's bed. Recovering in the spa side by side. Now they were going back to the city. Back to the office.
He didn't want this to end. He wanted more mornings drinking coffee before anyone else woke. More evenings talking by the fire. More moments where it was just the two of them.
Ian opened his eyes and turned to look at him. "Are you alright?"
"Yes. Just tired."
It was still bright when they finally reached the city. The buses pulled up to the office building at eight o'clock. Everyone got out, retrieving their luggage. People said their goodbyes and scattered to their cars or taxis.
"I can drive you home," Ian offered.
"That would be nice. Thank you."
They loaded Jay's luggage into Ian's car. The drive was short. Too short. They pulled up to Jay's building and Ian turned off the engine.
"Thank you for a wonderful weekend," Ian said.
"Thank you for inviting me to try the absinthe. Even if we paid for it dearly."
Jay opened the door but didn't get out. He wanted to say something more. How he'd never been happier than sitting by the fire drinking wine with Ian. How the thought of going back was unbearable. But he couldn't. It would be too much, too obvious.
"See you Monday," he said instead.
"See you Monday, Jay."
Ian retrieved Jay's suitcase from the trunk. They stood on the sidewalk, facing each other. Jay wanted to hug him. To hold on and not let go. Instead he took his suitcase and smiled.
He entered his apartment and set down his suitcase. Ian was probably entering his own apartment. So close. Just twelve minutes away. But it felt impossibly far.
Chapter 38: New faces
Scene 1
New hires
Jay arrived at the office at seven twenty. He'd been awake since five, unable to sleep. The retreat felt like a dream now. Three days where the rules had been different. Where he'd woken up beside Ian in the same bed.
He turned on his computer. The office was empty, silent. He opened his email and tried to focus on the messages that had accumulated over the weekend.
The elevator doors opened at seven thirty. Ian walked in. He stopped when he saw Jay.
"You're here early."
"I couldn't sleep."
They looked at each other. Jay wanted to say something, but the glass wall of Ian's office felt like a barrier again. The desk between them was back.
The rest of the team arrived around nine. The office filled with noise. Everyone was talking about the retreat.
"That cooking competition was incredible. Ian, you destroyed everyone. Where did you learn to make that sauce?" Luc said the moment he arrived.
"Practice."
"The fashion show was the best part," Ela said. "Ian, that outfit was absolutely wild."
"It was not my choice."
"You looked amazing though. Like some kind of avant-garde sculpture."
"You two disappeared after the disco," Ela said. "Where did you go?"
"We returned to the lodge," Jay said. "The disco was too loud."
"I heard people were still partying at three in the morning."
At the far end of the office, Ray sat at his desk with his headphones on. He hadn't acknowledged anyone. 
During the morning, Jay tried to focus but kept looking up at Ian through the glass. Ian was on the phone, then reviewing documents, then typing emails. The person who'd fallen asleep beside him on Saturday felt impossibly distant.
The afternoon was busier. The last week of May involved preparation for new hires. Ian called Jay into his office at three.
"We should review the onboarding procedures. The juniors arrive Monday morning at nine. HR will handle most of their training, but we'll need to welcome them and introduce them to the team."
"What should I prepare?"
"Nothing elaborate. A brief introduction to the department structure and the team members. HR will cover policies and systems."
"And the senior analyst?"
"Liv Moreau arrives at ten. She'll receive a personal onboarding session. I'll handle that directly."
"Should I sit in?"
"If you'd like. It might be useful for future reference."
They spent the next two hours reviewing procedures. Ian explained the timeline for integrating new hires, the typical adjustment period, the common challenges. Jay took notes and asked questions.
They worked until eight. When Jay finally left, Ian was still at his desk. Jay wanted to stay longer, to find an excuse to remain.
The apartment felt too empty when he got home. He retrieved the bottle of perfume they made and sprayed it into the air. The room filled with the fragrance they'd created together. Then he sat on the couch and closed his eyes. Three days. That was all it had been. 
The next day Jay helped Ian organize files for the new hires, reviewed their resumes again, prepared workspace assignments. They worked late that evening. The overtime felt like a gift. An excuse to be together.
On Wednesday, Jay left the office at four. He'd scheduled the final inspection of his old apartment for five, but he wanted to arrive early. To say goodbye properly.
The building looked smaller than he remembered. The lobby was dim and narrow. He climbed the stairs to the fourth floor and unlocked the door to his old studio.
It was empty. All his belongings were gone. The space looked larger without his furniture. Impersonal.
He walked to the window. The view was the same. He'd spent years looking at this view, in this tiny room with its cheap air conditioning and loud refrigerator. So many nights here. So many nights when he'd cried himself to sleep, when he'd felt worthless and broken. 
He took out a cloth and wiped down the windowsill. Dust had accumulated in the corners. He swept the floor and cleaned the kitchen counter. The apartment had served him well. It deserved a proper farewell.
The landlord's representative arrived at five.
"Everything looks good," she said after a quick inspection. "No damage, very clean. We'll return your full deposit."
They signed the contract termination papers. The whole process took fifteen minutes. She handed him the signed documents.
"Good luck with your new place."
"Thank you."
He locked the door for the last time and returned the keys. The walk to the metro felt surreal. He'd walked this route hundreds of times. Now he'd never walk it again.
By the time he reached his new apartment, the tears were already falling. He set down his bag and sat on the couch. The new place was beautiful, bright and perfectly designed. But he'd been attached to that tiny room. It had been his refuge. And now it was gone.
He cried for twenty minutes. Then he washed his face and made tea and tried to convince himself that leaving the past behind was a good thing. It didn't help much.
Thursday morning, Ian noticed immediately. Jay's eyes were red and slightly swollen. He'd tried to hide it but hadn't succeeded.
Ian waited until mid-morning, then called him into the office.
"Jay. Are you alright?"
"I'm fine."
"You don't look fine."
Jay sat down across from him. He looked exhausted. "I ended the lease yesterday, returned the keys. It was harder than I expected. I know the new apartment is better. I know I should be happy. But I was attached to the old place."
"It's not irrational. That apartment represented safety. Leaving it feels like losing something important."
"I cried when I got home. I cried some more in the morning."
"That's understandable."
Jay rubbed his face. "I feel stupid. It was just an apartment."
"It was more than that. Of course you're grieving. Take the day slowly. We're not facing any emergencies."
"I'll be fine."
The rest of the week passed quickly. Friday was spent finalizing preparations. On Monday morning, Jay arrived at seven thirty. He'd prepared a brief introduction for the juniors. Ian had reviewed it and approved.
At nine, the new hires arrived in the lobby. Jay and Ian met them there along with Sal from HR.
Rin Harris was a man in his late twenties with short brown hair and a well-cut suit. He looked nervous. His hands kept moving, adjusting his watch, smoothing his tie.
"Welcome to Turner & Associates. This is Jay Hall, my assistant. He'll be one of your primary points of contact."
"Thank you for the opportunity. I promise not to disappoint you too quickly," Rin said.
Gal Gray stood beside him. She looked exactly as she had during the interviews. Large glasses, old-fashioned bangs, modest clothing. She smiled shyly.
"We're glad to have you both. Sal will take you to the conference room now for the general onboarding session. You'll be joining mew analysts from other departments. The session will cover company policies, systems access, and administrative procedures," Jay said.
Sal led them away. Ian and Jay returned to the elevator.
"My onboarding looked different," Jay said.
"You were a special case. Leo recruited you directly and the circumstances were unusual. Normally we have a structured process."
"You handed me a stack of files and told me to read them."
"I wasn't particularly welcoming." 
"You were cautious. I understood."
They returned to the office. At ten, the elevator doors opened again. Liv Moreau stepped out.
She was beautiful. Early forties, dark hair, elegant suit, confident posture. Her smile was warm.
"Ian. It's wonderful to finally start."
Ian extended his hand. "Welcome, Liv. Thank you for joining us."
His tone was perfectly polite, but Jay noticed the strain. Ian's posture was too rigid. He was performing. It was completely different from when Ray had arrived. With Ray, Ian had seemed at ease. With Liv, he was guarded.
"This is Jay Hall, my assistant."
"A pleasure," Liv said, shaking Jay's hand. Her grip was firm. "I've heard excellent things about you."
"Thank you. Welcome to the team."
Ian led Liv into his office. Jay returned to his desk. Through the glass wall, he watched Ian conduct the onboarding session. Ian explained the department structure, current projects, reporting lines, expectations. Liv seemed relaxed, but Ian remained tense. 
At noon, the team gathered for lunch. Liv joined them happily.
"So you have three children," Luc said. "How do you manage work and family?"
"With a lot of support from my partner. We split responsibilities evenly."
"That's impressive. I can barely manage my own schedule."
"It's a matter of organization. And accepting that perfection isn't possible."
She asked about team dynamics and office culture. She listened attentively and responded thoughtfully. She was warm and engaging. Everyone seemed charmed.
"Ian and Ray never join these lunches," Ela said. "They prefer eating in the office."
"Different people have different needs. I won't take it personally."
She asked Jay about his role and responsibilities. He answered politely but kept his guard up. Ian's wariness was contagious.
At four, Ray left the office without acknowledging anyone. He put on his coat, picked up his bag, and walked out. He hadn't spoken to Liv once.
At five, Liv said her goodbyes and departed with the rest of the team. Jay stayed behind.
Ian emerged from his office at six. He looked tired.
"She seems very competent," Jay said.
"She is."
"But you're cautious."
"She's skilled at reading people and situations. That makes me wary."
"Do you think she's manipulative?"
"No. If I suspected that, I wouldn't have hired her. But I prefer to be cautious. She's very good at fitting in. At saying the right things. That kind of social intelligence can be used in many ways."
"I understand."
"Give it time. I might be overly suspicious."
But Jay trusted Ian's judgment. If Ian was wary, there was a reason.
That evening, as he rode the metro home, he thought about the new hires. The team was changing. Growing. Jay wasn't sure if that was entirely a good thing.
Scene 2
Nothing to offer
By Wednesday, the new hires were assigned their desks in the middle of the room, closer to Ray. HR's cheerful pep talks had ended. Now the real work began.
The office felt fuller. Out of twelve available desks, ten were occupied. It was still spacious, even fully staffed, the room wouldn't feel cramped, but it felt less airy now. More voices, more movement.
Jay gathered Rin and Gal by his desk. "I'll be guiding you through the initial tasks. But I want to be clear, I'm not your supervisor. Ian is. If you have concerns, you bring them to him. If you need to know where the staplers are kept, ask me."
"Understood," Gal said.
"Got it. So you're like... a fellow sufferer?" Rin said. He was adjusting his tie again.
"I'm Ian's assistant. I've been here longer, so I know the systems. But we're all on the same team."
"Right. Sorry. I'll try not to mess up too badly."
"You'll be fine."
They were polite, maybe a little too eager to please. Rin made jokes every time he fumbled something. When he accidentally printed too many documents, he laughed and said he was testing the system. When he misspelled a client name in a draft, he said he was creating an alternate timeline. Gal laughed at all of them, though she didn't seem the type who found many things funny.
Jay led them through the daily tasks. How to reserve conference rooms, where archived files were kept, how the printers operated.
They followed close behind. Rin scribbled notes he'd never be able to read later. Gal committed everything to memory.
"And these are the naming conventions. They're specific and they're not negotiable. Ian will notice if you deviate." Jay said, pulling up a document on his screen.
"Client code, date, document type, version number. No spaces, underscores only. Is that the template?" Gal asked.
"Yes."
"What about the shared drives? Is there a directory structure document?"
"Yes. I'll send it to you both. The folder hierarchy is strict. Don't create new folders without checking with Ian first."
"Why?"
"Because he designed the system. And it works. Changing it creates problems."
Gal nodded. She asked good questions. Jay had to admit she'd probably adapt fast.
That afternoon, he sat with Ian in his office, building a list of small assignments for the new analysts. Summaries, file formatting, basic data entry.
"These were my tasks when I started," Jay said.
"You learned quickly."
"I used to bring them home. I'd stay up until midnight perfecting them."
Ian looked at him. "That wasn't necessary."
"It felt necessary. I needed to feel I belonged here."
His old refrigerator had been plastered with notes. Client names, dates, shorthand reminders. He used to read them whenever he heated up dinner or made tea. Now his new refrigerator was spotless. Everything was already committed to memory.
"They'll learn at their own pace. Don't expect them to match your standards."
"I know."
"And Jay. You did belong here. From the beginning."
Jay looked down at the document on his screen. "Thank you."
At his desk the next morning, he watched Gal dive straight into her work. Her desk was already organized, files neatly labeled.
Rin seemed uncertain. He kept opening and closing files, checking his notes, then rechecking them. He was overthinking everything. When he finally submitted his draft to Jay, it was adequate but hesitant, full of qualifiers and cautious phrasing.
Liv drifted between desks like sunlight, stopping to offer encouragement or small talk. She paused by Rin's desk, glancing at his screen.
"How are you finding the work so far?" she asked.
"Trying not to drown," Rin said.
"You're doing fine. Everyone feels overwhelmed at first."
"Did you?"
"Constantly. For at least six months."
Rin smiled, looking relieved. Liv patted his shoulder and moved on to Gal's desk, asking about her previous role, complimenting her organization skills.
She had a knack for making everyone relax.
Ray, on the other hand, hadn't said a single word since eight o'clock. He sat at his desk with headphones on, working through his assignments. When Rin accidentally knocked into his chair while reaching for a file, Ray didn't even look up.
The difference between Liv and Ray became more visible as the days passed. She chatted happily, asked personal questions while never prying, showed interest without being nosy. She was easy to like.
But Jay was cautious. He was polite with her, answered her questions, but never volunteered information.
The rest of the team had no such reservations. Amy discussed her weekend plans with Liv. Luc told stories about his flatmates. Even Kim opened up about his gaming hobby when Liv asked.
The new hires were absorbed into the lunch outings. They kept close to Jay, looking to him for cues.
"What's good here?" Rin asked, studying the menu at Willow & Sage.
"Everything. I've tried the entire menu. Soups are excellent. The mushroom risotto if you're vegetarian. The salmon if you want something lighter."
"You've tried everything?" Gal asked.
"It's my favourite restaurant."
"What do you recommend most?"
"The autumn squash soup. And the rosemary bread. But that's seasonal, so it won't be available until September."
"You really have tried everything," Rin said.
The first week ended with no complications. The new hires were learning well. Jay explained everything in detail, guiding them through assignments, answering questions.
On Friday afternoon, he gathered them both at his desk again.
"I want to prepare you for what's coming. In July, we start quarterly reporting season. It gets hectic. Long hours, tight deadlines. Everyone's stressed."
"How long does it last?" Gal asked.
"About a week. Then there's a company party afterward."
"We got invitations with our onboarding package," Rin said. "Are we expected to go?"
"It's not mandatory, but everyone does."
"What's it like?" Gal asked.
"While the event is quite formal, the atmosphere is casual. People relax after the reporting season. There's food, drinks. It's a good opportunity to meet people from other departments."
When Jay started, no one explained these things to him. Adapting had been hard. He wanted to ease their experience.
"Thank you," Rin said. "This is really helpful."
"You're both doing well. Keep asking questions if you're uncertain about anything."
Liv made her place in the team fast. She learned the clients, the formats, the expectations. She never overstepped, never challenged Ian's authority.
Ray, on the other hand, had no reservations whenever he didn't like something.
"This timeline is unrealistic," Ray said on Friday afternoon, reviewing a project plan.
"The client requested it," Ian said.
"The client doesn't understand the complexity."
"Can it be done?"
"Yes. But not well."
"Then we'll need to manage their expectations."
"You should do that now. Before we commit resources."
"You're right. I'll contact them Monday."
It was clear they were both fluent with this sort of work, but their approaches were completely different. Liv adapted and accommodated. Ray was blunt and uncompromising.
Jay respected both styles, but he trusted Ray more. There was no performance with Ray, just direct honesty. With Liv, he couldn't shake the feeling that every interaction was evaluated and managed. Ian's wariness made sense now.
On Saturday, Jay went to his old gym. More because he needed moral support than to exercise.
Rus was on the treadmill when Jay arrived. He waved and finished his set, then joined Jay by the weights.
"You look thoughtful," Rus said.
"New hires started this week."
"How's it going?"
"Fine. They're both competent."
"But?"
"But the office feels different."
"Different how?"
Jay sat on the bench beside him. "Fuller. Busier."
"Is that bad?"
"No. It's good for the company. We needed the support. But I miss the quiet."
"Are you doing alright otherwise? You seem tense."
"I'm fine."
"You're always fine. That's your problem."
"What's that supposed to mean?"
"It means you never admit when something's bothering you."
Jay picked up his own weights and started working. Rus didn't push further. After they finished, Rus invited him for drinks.
"I can't. I have things to do."
"You always have things to do."
"I'm not a pub person. You know that."
"Fair enough. But if you need to talk, call me."
"I will."
Afterwards, Jay went to Café Lemon. It wasn't Fay's shift. A younger woman took his order. He still enjoyed his cappuccino in peace, sitting by the window and watching people pass by.
June was much cooler than last year. No heatwaves, just frequent rain. The sky was gray more often than blue. It suited his mood.
On Sunday, Jay went to his favorite park to clear his head. The weather wasn't inspiring, cloudy and windy, but he needed to stop and think. His life seemed to move very fast these days, and he barely had time to process any of it.
Maybe that was better. Because his thoughts inevitably always returned to Ian. And he was scared of admitting what that meant.
He walked the paths slowly, hands in his pockets. The park was nearly empty. A few joggers, an elderly couple feeding birds. He found a bench overlooking the pond and sat down.
He thought about waking up in Ian's bed at the resort. About Ian saying he looked beautiful at the gala. About every late evening in the office. About how his heart raced whenever Ian smiled at him. How he looked for excuses to go to Ian's office. 
He couldn't admit what it meant. 
Not because Ian was his boss. Not even because Ian was a man. But because it was absolutely hopeless.
Ian would never see him romantically. He'd been burned before by workplace relationships. He'd built walls for good reasons. He wasn't going to tear them down for his awkward assistant who barely knew how to function in high society.
Jay had nothing to offer. He was just someone who worked hard and tried not to embarrass himself.
Ian was kind to him. Protective, even. But that was mentorship. So there was no point even considering such thoughts.
A few drops of rain began to fall. Jay got up and walked back toward the metro station. By the time he reached his apartment, the rain was coming down steadily.
He made tea and sat on his balcony under the covered section, watching the rain fall on the river. He thought about Monday morning, returning to the office, seeing Ian through the glass wall. He couldn't want more than that, because wanting more would only lead to heartbreak.
Scene 3
Trapped
The second week went well enough. Rin sat close to Luc, and they exchanged dry observations throughout the day. They were clearly clicking with each other.
"I've discovered a new way to break the filing system," Rin said on Tuesday afternoon.
"That's impressive. Most people need at least a month to achieve that level of destruction," Luc replied.
Gal was in the corner near Amy and Max. She often went to Jay for clarification. Her questions only multiplied as the week progressed.
"Jay, the file naming convention for archived quarterly reports—does it include the fiscal year or calendar year?"
"Fiscal."
"And if there are amendments?"
"Add a version number. The document I sent you has examples."
"Right. Sorry. I saw that. I just wanted to confirm."
"It's fine. Better to ask than guess wrong."
She returned to her desk. Ten minutes later she was back.
"The client portfolios in the shared drive—are those updated weekly or monthly?"
"Weekly on Mondays. Unless there's a major transaction, then immediately."
"Okay. Thank you."
She seemed eager, almost anxious to get everything exactly right. Jay spent a lot of time during the day instructing both of them, answering questions, reviewing their work. Then he caught up on his own assignments in the evenings.
Ian monitored him closely. Jay seemed maybe a bit tired, a bit less talkative. But overall he didn't seem bothered, so Ian was relieved.
Their shared overtime in an empty office felt different now. Like the retreat had both brought them closer and revealed additional barriers at the same time.
They still worked late together most evenings. But the conversations had become harder to start. They sometimes exchanged looks without saying anything, neither breaking eye contact. Then one of them would turn back to their screen and the moment would pass.
Jay wanted to chat with Ian like they used to. Sitting on the couch in the lounge, drinking coffee, talking about nothing important. But he was also afraid. Of his own feelings, mostly. 
At the retreat, the closeness had felt natural. There were no desks, no formal roles. Just two people talking by a fire. In the office, everything seemed to highlight the barriers between them. The glass wall. The impossibility of it all.
Jay was afraid of being too obvious. Of letting something slip. And at the same time, he missed their closeness desperately.
On Thursday evening, he stayed until nine. Ian emerged from his office at eight thirty.
"You should go home. Get some rest."
"I'm almost finished."
"Jay."
"Five more minutes."
Ian stood beside his desk, close enough that Jay could smell his cologne. Jay kept his eyes on his screen. If he looked up, he'd say something stupid. Something that would ruin everything.
"Goodnight, Ian."
"Goodnight."
Ian left first. Jay waited ten minutes before packing his bag.
An integration party happened on Friday evening to help new hires feel more at home at the team's favorite bar, Murphy's.
Ian went, which was unusual for him. He rarely attended these events. But he felt obligated. The new hires were his responsibility. Ray was naturally absent.
The bar was crowded and loud. The team claimed their a table near the back. Drinks were ordered. Conversations overlapped.
Ian stood near the bar with a glass of whiskey. He watched Jay across the room. He was talking with Liv and Gal, all three of them smiling. Liv said something and Jay laughed. Gal added a comment and Jay responded animatedly.
It was lively and natural. Jay looked relaxed, engaged. He wasn't the awkward, uncertain person he'd been two years ago.
Ian never really talked with his team that much during these events. He attended, stayed for an appropriate amount of time, then left. Small talk exhausted him. He had nothing to contribute to conversations about weekend plans or television shows.
But Jay was different. He could talk to anyone now. He made people comfortable. Even Gal was speaking freely with him.
Luc joined their group, then Rin. Ela and Zoe had joined them as well. The circle expanded. 
Ian watched from across the room at beautiful women flocking to Jay. It hurt to witness. It only highlighted the inevitability of Jay eventually drifting away.
Maybe he was already drifting. Their evening conversations had become stilted. Jay left earlier now than he used to. He had other friends, other places to be. He had a life outside the office.
That was good. Ian wanted Jay to have a full, rich life. But it also meant Jay didn't need him anymore. Ian checked his watch. Ten o'clock. Acceptable to leave.
He found Amy. "I'm heading out. Thank you for organizing this."
"Already? The night is young."
"I have an early morning."
"You always have an early morning. Goodnight, Ian."
"Goodnight."
Ian left without saying goodbye to anyone else. 
His apartment was dark and silent. He turned on the lights, poured himself a glass of whiskey, and sat on the couch.
He shouldn't have gone to the party. He'd known it would be difficult. But he'd hoped—
What had he hoped? That Jay would seek him out? That Jay would stand by his side instead of socializing with everyone else?
That was ridiculous. Jay was supposed to socialize. He was supposed to make connections, build relationships with his colleagues. Ian wanted that for him.
But watching Liv touch Jay's arm, watching Gal look at him with clear admiration—it had been unbearable.
Ian took a drink. The whiskey burned.
Jay was surrounded by beautiful, charming women. Liv was elegant and warm. Gal was intelligent and attentive. Ela and Zoe were amiable and friendly. Any of them would be a better match for Jay than he ever could be. And Jay was young, radiant. He could have anyone he wanted. There was no shortage of attractive people in the world. Jay could meet anyone at any time. There were probably dozens of people interested in him. He was kind, intelligent, beautiful.
And Ian had no claim on him. No right to feel possessive or territorial. Jay was his assistant. His colleague. Nothing more.
But Ian wanted more. He'd wanted more for months now. He'd tried to suppress it, tried to be appropriate. But the retreat had broken something open in him. Waking up beside Jay. Talking late into the night by the fire. The way Jay had looked at him during the fashion show.
For a brief moment, Ian had let himself believe there might be something there. Some reciprocal feeling. Some possibility. But back in the office, the distance had returned.
Ian finished his whiskey and poured another.
He'd been extremely wary of Liv from the start. Not because of business reasons. Her credentials were impeccable, her work excellent. Because she was beautiful and charming. Because Jay smiled when talking to her. Because she represented everything Ian couldn't offer.
It didn't matter that she was happily married. What if Jay preferred her company? What if he stopped looking at Ian with those admiring eyes and instead moved on to someone else?
Someone appropriate. Someone who could take him to nice restaurants and weekend trips. Someone who could love him openly.
Ian knew he was being unreasonable. Jealousy was unproductive and childish. Liv had done nothing wrong. She was a valuable addition to the team. Jay was allowed to have friendships, relationships, a life beyond work.
But he couldn't contain it. Every time Liv made Jay laugh, Ian felt something twist in his chest. Every time Gal asked Jay for help with that eager expression, Ian wanted to intervene.
He was jealous of his own employees. Of women who'd done nothing but be friendly. It was absurd, but it was also consuming him.
Ian set down his glass and leaned back against the couch. The apartment was too quiet, too empty. He thought about Jay twelve minutes away, probably just getting home from the party. Maybe still thinking about the conversations he'd had. Maybe texting someone. Maybe smiling at his phone.
Ian had spent two years managing his feelings. Keeping them hidden and controlled. He'd told himself it was enough to be near Jay, to mentor him, to watch him thrive. But it wasn't enough anymore.
The retreat had shown him what it could be like. What it felt like to have Jay's undivided attention, to talk freely without the weight of their roles pressing down on them. To fall asleep beside him and wake up to find him still there.
And now Ian couldn't go back to pretending he didn't want that. He wanted Jay. He wanted him so completely it frightened him.
But Jay was slipping away. Making other connections. Building a life that didn't revolve around late nights in the office. And Ian had no right to stop him.
He couldn't keep doing this. He couldn't keep watching Jay from behind barriers he'd built himself. But he also couldn't cross those barriers. He couldn't risk Jay's career, his comfort, his trust. He couldn't be selfish enough to confess feelings that would only make everything complicated and painful. Jay was his assistant. The power imbalance made any relationship inappropriate. Jay deserved better than a boss who couldn't keep his feelings in check.
And even if the circumstances were different, why would Jay want him? Ian was cold and detached. He didn't know how to be warm the way Liv was warm. He didn't know how to make people feel at ease.
So he was trapped. Loving someone he couldn't have. Watching someone he wanted drift slowly out of reach.
This was his own fault. He'd let himself fall despite knowing better. He'd allowed hope to grow where there should have been only restraint. Now he'd pay the price for that weakness.
He thought about texting him. Asking if he'd gotten home safely. But that would be transparent. Pathetic.
So he sat in the dark and drank his whiskey and tried not to think about beautiful women surrounding Jay at the bar. Tried not to imagine Jay smiling at someone else the way he sometimes smiled at Ian.
He was losing Jay. Maybe not today. Maybe not next month. But eventually. And there was nothing he could do to stop it.
By midnight, he'd finished half the bottle. 
He went to his bedroom, but he knew he wouldn't sleep. He'd lie awake thinking about Jay at the party, surrounded by people who could offer him everything Ian couldn't. He sat on the edge of his bed and put his head in his hands. 
He'd never felt more alone.
Scene 4
The wrong kind of attention
The following week, Gal was too enthusiastic.
Since Monday after the party, she seemed to cling to Jay even more. She joined him for coffee in the break room. During their team lunch outing, she sat next to him and asked about his weekend, his apartment, his commute.
"How long have you lived in the city?" she asked.
"A few years now."
"Do you like it?"
"It's fine."
"Did it take you long to adapt?"
"A while," Jay said. He took a bite of his salmon, hoping the conversation would move on.
It didn't. Gal kept asking questions. What neighbourhood did he live in? Did he have roommates? Where did he go to university?
Jay answered politely but minimally. He didn't know how to discourage her without hurting her feelings. She was new, eager, trying to make connections. He remembered being in her position, but it still made him uncomfortable.
"Could you review this formatting? I want to make sure I'm doing it correctly," she asked on Monday afternoon.
Jay glanced at the document. "It looks fine. You can submit it to Ian."
"Are you sure? I don't want to make mistakes."
"You're doing well. Don't worry so much."
She smiled. "Thank you. You're very patient with me."
She used to be enthusiastic before, but it was slowly turning more personal. On Tuesday morning, she brought him coffee.
"I noticed you always have it at nine. So I made you one."
"That's kind. Thank you."
"It's no trouble. We're making coffee at the same time anyway."
She was trying hard to be helpful, but the attention felt excessive.
Ian was suddenly on high alert. He'd been mostly focused on Liv, but it seemed the dangers might come from another angle. He kept his distance but tracked every interaction. Through the glass wall, he watched Gal approach Jay's desk repeatedly and his polite but strained responses. Ian's expression never changed, but his wariness grew.
Gal stayed overtime on Tuesday evening over a minor formatting issue. She was there early the next morning, arriving at the same time as Jay to make coffee.
"Good morning," she said brightly.
"Morning."
"Did you sleep well?"
"Fine. You?"
"Not bad. I was up late finishing that summary."
"You could have left it for today."
"I wanted to make sure it was right."
She lingered while Jay poured his coffee. When he returned to his desk, she followed and stood by his chair.
"Can I ask you something?"
"Of course."
"How do you manage everything? You're always so organized and calm. I feel like I'm constantly scrambling."
"You've only been here a few weeks. It takes time."
"But you make it look easy."
"It's not. I just know the systems now."
"You're really good at this."
"Thank you."
Each following day, she gave him more attention. Friday afternoon, she asked if he wanted to review her work together instead of just submitting it.
"I think I'd learn more if you walked me through the feedback," she said.
"I can do that."
They sat together at his desk. Gal pulled her chair close, leaning in to see the screen. Jay explained the formatting issues, the phrasing adjustments. She nodded seriously, taking notes.
"You're a really good teacher," she said when they finished.
"I'm just doing my job."
"No, really. You're patient. And you explain things clearly. I'm lucky to have you as a mentor."
Jay didn't know what to say to that. He understood trying hard. He'd done the same thing at the beginning—arrived early, tried desperately to prove himself. He felt sympathy.
But for Ian, her attention was immediately suspect.
He remembered the man who'd deceived him years ago. The eager assistant who'd seemed so earnest, so dedicated. Who'd stayed late and asked thoughtful questions and looked at him with admiration. The pattern was too familiar.
Rin, meanwhile, was way more relaxed about everything. Not exactly lazy, but definitely not an overachiever. He completed his assignments adequately and left at five o'clock without looking back.
He got friendly with Luc quickly. Luc was the friendliest on the team, easy to talk to, always ready with a joke or story. Their banter lightened the atmosphere.
"I've managed to confuse the filing system again," Rin said.
"That's a talent. How did you accomplish it this time?"
"I'm not entirely sure. I clicked something and everything disappeared."
"Did you try clicking it again?"
"Obviously. That made it worse."
"Classic mistake."
They worked through the problem together, laughing about it the entire time. Rin also sat closest to Ray. Whenever Ray got up to get coffee, Rin tried casual small talk.
"Nice weather today," Rin said on Tuesday morning.
Ray walked past without responding.
On Wednesday, Rin tried again. "Did you see the market report this morning?"
Ray ignored him completely.
On Thursday, Rin switched tactics. "I heard the new lunch place on Fifth Street is good."
Still nothing.
But Rin wasn't discouraged at all. Each day he picked a new topic, hoping something would finally catch Ray's attention. On Thursday afternoon, Rin approached Jay's desk.
"Can I ask you something?"
"Of course."
"Does Ray ever talk to anyone?"
"Not really. He keeps to himself."
"Is he always like this?"
"Yes. He's very focused on his work."
Rin looked relieved. "Okay. Good. I thought maybe I'd offended him somehow."
"You haven't. That's just how he is."
"Everyone here seems terrifying, honestly. But Ray is actually less scary than the rest of you."
"Less scary?"
"Yeah. He doesn't look as polished."
"Ray is extremely competent."
"I know. But he doesn't look it. He looks like someone who rolled out of bed and came to work. That's approachable."
Jay tried to view the team through the perspective of a new person. He'd been here so long that everyone just seemed like themselves. It was difficult for him to imagine how everyone must look to Rin. Ian in his perfectly tailored suits. Amy and Ela always impeccably dressed. Even Luc looked casually sophisticated.
He remembered his first days. His country mannerisms. How out of place he'd felt. How everyone had seemed impossibly competent. Would Ray have seemed more approachable back then? Simply because he didn't look as polished? Maybe. Ray dressed well enough, but not with the attention others did. His hair was always slightly messy. There was something deliberately unremarkable about his presentation.
"Do we really seem terrifying?"
"Yes. Ray is the only one who doesn't. Everyone else looks like they stepped out of a magazine."
"Even me?"
"Especially you. You're always perfectly dressed. You know everything about everything. You're calm and organized. It's intimidating."
"I suppose that makes sense," Jay said.
"You probably don't know what it's like," Rin sighed.
"I was the same at the beginning."
"Really?"
"I wore cheap suits and had no idea how anything worked. I was terrified for months."
"You don't seem like the terrified type."
"I got better at hiding it."
"That's encouraging, I guess."
By Friday, Gal's attention had become impossible to ignore.
She appeared at Jay's desk first thing in the morning with coffee. She asked him to review documents that didn't need reviewing. She sat beside him at lunch and asked personal questions.
"Do you live near the office?" she asked.
"About twenty minutes away."
"That's convenient. I'm still commuting from my parents' place. It takes nearly an hour."
"That's a long commute."
"I'm looking for an apartment closer. Do you have any recommendations?"
"The area near the river is nice. That's where I live."
"Maybe you could show me around sometime?"
Jay felt trapped. It was a reasonable request, but it felt like more than that.
"I'm sure the real estate agents can give you better information than I can."
"I'd rather hear from someone who actually lives there."
"I'll send you some listings."
He returned to his desk feeling relieved to have escaped, but Gal followed him.
"Could you look at this summary? I'm not sure about the conclusion."
Jay reviewed it quickly. "It's fine. Submit it to Ian."
"Are you sure? I don't want to bother him with something that's not perfect."
"It's his job to review your work. That's the process."
"But you're so much more approachable."
Ian was watching from his office. Jay could feel his attention like a weight.
"Ian is very fair. You don't need to be afraid of him."
"I'm not afraid. I just prefer working with you."
She smiled at him. It was a warm, honest smile, but it made Jay deeply uncomfortable. He didn't know what to say, so he said nothing and turned back to his computer.
That evening, Jay stayed late. After Gal finally left at six, Ian emerged from his office.
"Can we talk?"
"Of course."
Ian closed the door to his office. They sat across from each other. Jay could see the tension in his posture.
"Gal seems to be seeking your attention frequently."
"She's eager. Trying to learn."
"It seems excessive."
"I thought so too. But I remember how I was at the beginning. Always asking questions. I was probably annoying as well."
"You weren't like this. You didn't bring coffee uninvited or find excuses to sit beside me."
"I was terrified of you. That probably limited my enthusiasm."
"I don't want you to feel obligated to accommodate her beyond normal mentoring."
"I'm just trying to help her adjust."
"I understand. But if her attention becomes uncomfortable, you can redirect her to me."
"I will. Thank you."
"You're too kind sometimes."
"Is that a bad thing?"
"No. But people can take advantage of kindness."
Jay thought about that after he left. About Ian's wariness, about Gal's attention. He still believed she was just trying hard, but Ian's concern had planted a seed of doubt. Maybe he was being naive. Maybe he was missing something.
Ian watched him from his office. This was going to be a problem.
Scene 5
Sweet closeness
On Saturday, Jay went to his old gym and found Rus near the rowing machine.
"You look stressed," Rus said.
"One of the new hires is being clingy."
"The junior analyst?"
"Gal. She follows me around constantly. Asks questions she could figure out herself. Sits next to me at lunch."
"Can't you redirect her to someone else?"
"I've tried. She always comes back."
"Have you told her to back off?"
"No. She's new. I don't want to hurt her feelings."
"But she's making you uncomfortable."
"Yes," Jay admitted.
"What does your boss think?"
"He noticed. He warned me to be careful."
"Smart man."
They moved to the weights, but Jay was distracted.
"I still haven't found a new gym. I work out twice a week for half an hour at home after work. But it's not the same. The gym atmosphere is more motivating."
"You're always welcome to stay here forever. Or you could try jogging. The weather's finally nice."
Jay thought about it. It was true. The weather had turned pleasant—not too hot, with long days and comfortable evenings. The city was actually tolerable in summer for once.
"Maybe I could jog by the river."
"There you go. Fresh air, exercise, no clingy coworkers."
"I don't know if I can run properly."
"No one can run properly when they start. You just do it anyway."
Jay finished his set. Rus was right. Maybe jogging would help. At least it would get him out of his apartment.
"Thanks for listening," Jay said.
"Anytime. And seriously, if the clingy coworker becomes a real problem, talk to HR."
"It's not that bad."
"Yet. But keep it in mind."
At work the following week, Gal continued to follow Jay around whenever she could. Jay was polite but didn't really engage beyond answering her questions and returning to his own work.
"Jay, do you have a minute?" she asked on Monday morning.
"I'm in the middle of something. Can it wait?"
"Oh. Sure. I'll come back later."
She returned fifteen minutes later. "Is now a good time?"
"What do you need?"
"I was wondering about the client retention reports. How detailed should they be?"
"Follow the template I sent you."
"Right. But should I include the quarterly breakdown or just annual?"
"Quarterly."
"Okay. And what about—"
"The template has examples. Look at those first. If you still have questions after, come back," Jay said, trying to keep his tone gentle.
"Oh. Okay. Sorry."
She returned to her desk. Jay felt guilty but also relieved.
As July approached and quarterly reports loomed, it was time to introduce the senior analysts to the workload. Ian organized meetings every afternoon with Liv and Ray. Amy and Max showed the fundamentals and the general requirements. Jay was there too, mostly as administrative support. He knew the formats, file systems, and delivery methods intimately. He wrote down the timelines and meeting summaries afterwards.
"The reports are due by the tenth. We compile data the first week. Final reviews and submissions in the final days," Ian explained.
"That's tight," Liv said.
"It's always tight. You learn to work fast."
"What's the typical workload?"
"Sixty to seventy hours per week. Sometimes more."
"And everyone participates?"
"Senior analysts lead their assigned portfolios. Junior analysts provide support. Jay coordinates submissions and manages the schedule."
Liv nodded, taking notes. Ray sat silently, absorbing the information. Amy and Max exchanged looks—they'd been through this before.
"Any questions?" Ian asked.
"Are there templates for the analysis sections?" Ray asked.
"Yes. Jay will distribute them tomorrow."
"What's the acceptable error margin?"
"Zero. We verify everything twice."
Ray made a note. Liv asked follow-up questions. Jay typed everything into his laptop.
In the evenings, he stayed over with Ian, catching up on the regular work that was slowly starting to pile up. The quarterly preparation consumed the afternoons. Their normal tasks accumulated.
On Wednesday, something urgent came up—a client needed revisions on a proposal by morning. They worked until ten. When Jay finally closed his laptop, his eyes burned from staring at the screen.
"I'll drive you home," Ian said.
Jay looked up, surprised. "You don't have to."
"We're neighbours. It's no trouble."
"That would be nice. Thank you."
Ian had wanted to do this for the longest time, but he'd been careful about not overstepping, not shaking the fragile balance they'd built. This felt like the most natural moment. They were both exhausted. The offer was practical.
They took the elevator down to the parking garage. Jay sank into the passenger seat. The drive was short and comfortable. Ian drove smoothly. Jay watched the city pass outside the window.
"Are you ready for next week?" Ian asked.
"As ready as I can be."
"It will be intense."
"I know."
They pulled up in front of Jay's building. 
"Thank you for driving me," Jay said.
"Anytime."
Jay opened the door, then hesitated. "Goodnight, Ian."
"Goodnight, Jay."
Jay went inside. Ian waited until he saw the lobby door close, then drove home. He felt happy. It was such a small thing, driving Jay home, but it had felt right.
He still had some time to have Jay for himself, before Jay inevitably got taken from him. He could still savour this sweet closeness they'd developed.
Ian poured himself a glass of water and stood by the window. Twelve minutes away, Jay was in his apartment. Maybe making tea. Maybe already in bed. Ian allowed himself to imagine it for a moment. Then he pushed the thought away and went to prepare for tomorrow.
The next day, Gal was hovering around Jay's desk again with questions that barely qualified as questions.
"Do you think this phrasing is okay, or should I rework it?"
"It's fine."
"Are you sure? I feel like it could be clearer."
"Gal, it's fine."
"Maybe if I—"
"Excuse me," a voice said.
They both turned. Ray was standing there, holding a folder.
"I need to talk to Jay," Ray said. 
"Oh. I can wait."
"This is work-related and time-sensitive. Return to your desk," Ray said bluntly.
Gal's face fell. She walked back, clearly sulking.
Ray sat down in the chair she'd vacated. "I need to clarify the timeline for the quarterly data verification. How many stages?"
"Three. Initial check, cross-reference, final review."
"Who handles each stage?"
"Initial check is the analyst who compiled the data. Cross-reference is a different analyst. Final review is Ian."
"What's the turnaround time?"
"Twenty-four hours per stage. Seventy-two hours total."
"Acceptable. Thank you."
Ray returned to his desk without another word.
Jay stared after him. That was the first time they'd actually spoken. It had been a series of technical questions, nothing more. But Jay was glad Gal had left him alone.
From his office, Ian had watched the entire exchange. When Ray bluntly dismissed Gal, Ian smiled secretly. Maybe she'd get a clue.
That evening, Jay returned home at a normal hour. The weather was good—warm but not oppressive, with a pleasant breeze. He decided to try jogging.
He changed into gym clothes and went down to the river path. Other people were out running, cycling, walking dogs. Jay started at an easy pace.
His running form wasn't very good. His breathing became laboured quickly and his stride felt awkward. After half an hour, he returned home sweaty and miserable. Running was harder than it looked. He showered and collapsed on the couch. Maybe jogging wasn't for him. Or maybe he just needed practice.
He thought about texting Rus but decided against it. Instead, he made tea and sat on the balcony, watching the city lights come on as evening fell.
Friday was consumed by last-minute preparations. Everyone was busy. Files were organized, templates distributed, schedules confirmed.
Ian called a brief team meeting at four.
"Next week will be intense. Expect long hours. Prioritize urgent tasks. Ask for help if you're overwhelmed. We're a team. We support each other."
Everyone nodded. The new hires looked nervous. The veterans looked resigned.
Jay worked through his checklist. By evening, most people had left, exhausted from the week. Only he and Ian remained. They worked until ten again. When Jay finally stood to pack his things, Ian appeared in his doorway.
"I'll drive you home."
"You don't have to—"
"It's late, Jay. Come on."
Jay didn't argue. They took the elevator down together, got in Ian's car, drove through the city streets.
"Have a restful weekend. You'll need it," Ian said when they arrived.
"You too."
"I'll try."
Jay got out of the car. "Thank you for the ride."
"Anytime."
Jay went inside. Ian watched until the door closed, then drove home.
Jay took the elevator up to his apartment. He dropped his bag by the door and went straight to the bedroom. He was too tired to make tea, too tired to do anything but collapse.
But as he lay in bed staring at the ceiling, all he could think about was Ian's profile in the car, streetlights  illuminating his face. The comfort of sitting beside him.
Jay closed his eyes.
He was in trouble. Deep, hopeless trouble. But there was nothing he could do about it. So he'd do what he always did—push it down, ignore it, focus on work. It had worked so far.


Chapter 39: Facing the truth
Scene 1
Workflow disruptions
July began and quarterly reports descended on them like a storm. People arrived early and left late. Coffee consumption tripled. The printer ran constantly.
It was a chaotic period. Not only were reports being compiled, but the new senior analysts needed training. Liv and Ray shadowed the team, observing procedures, asking questions, learning the systems.
But both learned fast and didn't obstruct the workflow. Liv took meticulous notes and knew when to step back. Ray watched silently, absorbing everything, never interrupting. It went better than planned.
Luc took Rin under his wing and showed him the ropes. "You're basically a glorified printer for the next week. Print things, organize documents, fetch coffee. Don't ask complicated questions during crunch time."
"Got it. Be useful, be invisible."
"Exactly."
Rin understood the assignment perfectly. He made himself small, printing reports, sorting files, running errands. When he had questions, he saved them for quieter moments.
Zoe wanted to take Gal under her wing the same way, but Gal kept fleeing to Jay instead.
"Jay, how do I format this section?"
"Follow the template."
"But I'm not sure if—"
"Gal, I'm in the middle of something. Ask Zoe."
"I already did. I wanted your opinion."
Everyone exchanged looks. Kim shook his head slightly.
Ray, true to form, didn't stay a second longer than his normal hours. He arrived at eight, working tirelessly during those eight hours, but the moment four o'clock came, he was gone.
Liv stayed a bit longer but also left around six. "I have to pick up my boys. But I'll be back early tomorrow."
The new senior analysts didn't actually do any work yet. They observed, made notes, asked questions. They weren't needed beyond learning, so they left at normal hours. Rin felt the atmosphere correctly and adapted. He left at five or six, understanding that his inexperience would only slow things down.
But Gal was ambitious. She insisted on staying late, hovering near Jay's desk with questions while everyone scrambled on a tight schedule.
"Jay, should I include the quarterly variance analysis or just the annual?"
"Gal, I told you—follow the template."
"But I want to make sure I'm learning correctly."
"You're learning by watching. Not by interrupting."
She looked hurt. But ten minutes later, she was back.
"Jay, about the client retention metrics—"
Amy's voice was sharp. "Gal. He's busy. We're all busy. Save your questions for later."
"Oh. Sorry."
She retreated to her desk but didn't leave. She sat there, ostensibly working on practice documents, but really just watching Jay.
An hour later, Ian's door opened. He stepped out, scanned the office, and his attention fixed on Gal's desk.
"Gal. My office, please."
Jay watched through the glass wall. Ian's expression was calm. Gal sat across from him, nodding. The conversation lasted five minutes.
When Gal emerged, she was pouting. She packed her things and left without saying goodbye.
Jay felt a wave of relief. At least one burden less. He was eternally thankful for Ian's intervention.
That evening, after everyone else had left, Jay went to Ian's office.
"Thank you for talking to her," Jay said.
"She was disrupting the workflow."
"I know. But I didn't know how to say it without being harsh."
"That's my job. You focus on the reports. Let me handle personnel issues."
"What did you tell her?"
"That her enthusiasm is appreciated but her timing is poor. That the best way to learn during reporting season is to observe and ask questions afterwards. That staying late when she's not contributing is not helpful."
"How did she take it?"
"She understood. She may not like it, but she understood."
Jay sat down in the chair across from Ian's desk. They were alone in the office now. The city was dark outside the windows.
"How are you holding up?" Ian asked.
"Tired. But fine."
"You're managing everything well."
"I have practice now."
"You're doing excellent work."
Jay felt warmth in his chest. "Thank you."
Jay didn't want to leave. It was late and he was exhausted, but sitting here with Ian felt like the only peaceful moment in days.
"We should go home," Ian said gently.
Ian drove Jay home every night. It became expected. Neither of them questioned it.
On Thursday night, they sat in the car outside Jay's building. Too tired to move immediately.
"The worst will be next week. Final reviews and client presentations."
"I know."
They sat in silence for a moment. The building windows glowed with warm light.
"I should go," Jay said. "Get some sleep."
"Yes. Goodnight."
"Goodnight, Ian."
Jay got out of the car. Ian watched him enter the building before driving away.
They worked on Saturday as well. The old guard worked twelve-hour days, six days a week. They arrived at eight and left at eight, sometimes later.
The second week was more intense. Final reviews, corrections, submissions. Everyone worked frantically to meet the deadline.
Liv and Ray helped with the final review, double-checking the correctness of calculations and formatting.
"This variance calculation is wrong," Ray said, pointing at Amy's screen.
"Where?"
"Here. You divided by the wrong quarter."
Amy groaned. "You're right. Thank you."
Liv caught a formatting inconsistency in Max's report. "The headers don't match the template."
"I thought we updated the template."
"We did. But this file is using the old version."
"I'll fix it."
By Tuesday evening, everything was nearly complete. One more day of review and they'd be finished.
Gal sat at her desk, working on training exercises Zoe had given her. She'd stopped approaching Jay. She left at five every day without comment. Her enthusiasm had been replaced by resignation.
Jay felt guilty but also relieved. He didn't have time to manage her feelings right now.
Ian drove Jay home one last time. They'd return to normal hours tomorrow. Jay was disappointed. He'd gotten used to these evening drives.
"Thank you for driving me all week. It was very kind."
"It was practical. We're neighbors."
"Still. I appreciated it."
Ian pulled up in front of the building. "Have a good evening, Jay."
"You too."
Jay got out of the car. He stood on the sidewalk and watched Ian drive away.
He took the elevator to his apartment. He made tea and sat on the couch, thinking about the past week. The chaos, the pressure, the exhaustion. The camaraderie of the team working toward a shared goal.
And Ian. Always Ian. Calm and steady through the storm. Protecting Jay from Gal's intrusions. Offering praise and encouragement.
Jay's feelings hadn't lessened. If anything, they'd intensified. Every shared glance, every moment of understanding had only made it worse.
Not that it changed anything. Ian was still his boss. Still impossibly out of reach. Still someone who would never see him that way.
Scene 2
After the flood
On Wednesday at four in the afternoon, after the final day of checking and corrections, all of the reports were submitted. Everyone breathed with relief. The worst was behind them.
The team left at a normal hour. Everyone felt lighter. The weight of the past two weeks lifted.
Jay returned home before six. He changed into his athletic clothes and went out for another run along the river path.
It was just as miserable as the previous one. He'd missed the gym on Saturday, and with how irregularly he'd been exercising recently, he could feel his form slipping.
But the weather was nice—warm and clear, with a pleasant breeze off the water. Being away from the office rejuvenated him. The last week had strained him, but all in all, it had been better than he'd feared.
He returned home sweaty and discouraged.
On Thursday morning, Jay went to Ian's office.
"Do you have a moment?"
"Of course."
Jay sat down across from him. "I'd like to request Friday off. Next week, I mean. The nineteenth."
"Any particular reason?"
"My family is arriving Thursday evening. They're staying over for the weekend."
"Of course. Take the day," Ian said. He made a note on his calendar.
"Thank you."
"Are they coming for your birthday?"
"That was one of the considerations."
"Your birthday is this Sunday, isn't it?"
"Yes. But I was too busy recently to prepare properly. We delayed the visit to next week."
"What are your plans for Sunday?"
"I don't have any."
"May I come over with a gift?"
"You don't need to—"
"I'd like to. If you're comfortable with that."
"I... yes. That would be nice."
"What time would be convenient?"
"Afternoon? Around two?"
"Perfect. I'll see you then."
Jay returned to his desk, feeling off-balance. Ian was coming to his apartment on Sunday. For his birthday. His hands were trembling slightly.
Ian knew he was treading on thin ice. But his fear that he'd lose Jay soon forced him to act. To create some memories, at least. To have something to hold onto when Jay inevitably moved on.
Throughout the day, both Liv and Ray had follow-up questions for practically everyone. Clarifications about processes, details about client preferences, technical specifications.
"What's the typical revision timeline?" Liv asked Max.
"Depends on the client. Some want changes within twenty-four hours. Others take weeks to respond."
"And if they request major structural changes?"
"We renegotiate the timeline. Ian handles those conversations."
Gal was quiet and pouting dramatically. She'd stopped bringing coffee to Jay. She'd stopped hovering by his desk. Instead, she sat at her own desk with exaggerated sighs, making her suffering extremely theatrical.
Jay did not engage. He was frankly exhausted by her. She'd seemed so level-headed when they'd hired her, but now she was nothing but dramatic.
But he also recognized himself from the past in her. When he'd been rebuffed by Ian and taken it poorly. When he'd sulked and withdrawn, convinced he'd failed completely. He remembered how wretched he'd felt back then. And despite everything, he felt sympathy.
On Thursday afternoon, he met Gal in the kitchen. She was making coffee and sighing dramatically.
"Oh," she said when she saw him. "I'll get out of your way."
"You don't have to."
Another heavy sigh. She poured her coffee slowly, like each movement required enormous effort.
Jay made his own coffee. He should leave. He should just take his cup and go back to his desk, but the memory of his own misery held him there.
"Gal," he said.
She looked at him. Her eyes were slightly red.
"Don't take it personally. The first few months are always the hardest. Everyone struggles. I certainly did."
"You seem perfect at everything."
"I'm not. I made mistakes constantly when I started. I still make them."
"But everyone likes you."
"That took time. And effort. And a lot of embarrassment."
"I just wanted to do well."
"I know. But there's a time and place for questions. During reporting season isn't it. People are stressed. They don't have the capacity to teach while they're scrambling to meet deadlines."
"Ian said the same thing."
"Because it's true."
"I thought if I stayed late and showed dedication, everyone would see how serious I am."
"They saw it. But dedication without awareness isn't helpful. You have to read the room. Understand when to push forward and when to step back."
Gal looked at him intently. So intently it scared him a bit. Her expression was too focused, too hopeful.
"You're very kind," she said.
"I'm just trying to help."
"No one else bothered to explain. They just exchanged looks and whispered about me."
"That's not—"
"You're different. You understand."
Jay felt a bad feeling creep over him. This wasn't gratitude. This was something else. He'd wanted to be kind, to give the encouragement he'd wished someone had given him. But the way she'd looked at him made his stomach turn.
"I should get back to work," he said. He left the kitchen quickly. Later that afternoon, he stopped by Ian's office.
"Do you have a moment?"
"Always."
Jay closed the door. "I talked to Gal earlier. I was trying to be helpful, but I think I might have made things worse."
"How?"
"She looked at me like I'd given her something to hold on to. I just wanted to tell her not to take it personally."
"You were being kind. That's not a mistake."
"But I have a bad feeling about it."
"I'll keep an eye on the situation."
"Maybe I shouldn't have said anything."
"You were trying to help. That's not wrong."
Jay wasn't convinced, but he returned to his desk and tried to focus on work.
On Friday, everyone including Ian left the office by five. It was the day of the quarterly party. Everyone wanted time to prepare. Jay had a hairdresser appointment at five thirty. He'd booked it weeks ago, knowing he'd need a trim. Jay left the salon at six fifteen with his hair freshly cut and styled.
He went straight home to get changed. No need to eat dinner. Getting stuffed at the party was the highlight of the evening.
Scene 3
Impossible love
The quarterly party was held at a restaurant in the financial district. The entire company attended, filling the private event space with conversation and laughter.
Jay arrived at the venue at seven thirty. He'd chosen his best gray three-piece suit with the sapphire cufflinks Ian had given him last Christmas. He'd tried to go for a serious, stately look, but somehow he'd ended up looking absolutely gorgeous.
The venue was already crowded. People from different departments mingled near the bar. Music played in the background.
Luc spotted him first. "There he is. Looking sharp, Jay."
"Thank you."
"Rin is over there looking terrified. Go save him."
Jay found Rin standing awkwardly near a table. "How are you holding up?"
"Everyone here is so confident. I feel like I'm wearing a sign that says new hire."
"You'll be fine. Just relax and talk to people."
They chatted for a while. Jay introduced Rin to a few analysts from other departments.
The evening progressed pleasantly. Jay talked to Amy about her upcoming vacation. He listened to Max's stories about his daughter's graduation. He laughed at Kim's observations about the catering.
Ian arrived at eight. He wore perfectly tailored dark suit. He looked composed as always. His eyes scanned the room and found Jay immediately. Jay felt his heart skip.
Gal arrived shortly after. She wore a black dress and heels. She'd clearly put effort into her appearance. She made her way to the bar and ordered a drink. Then another. Then another. By nine, she was visibly drunk.
Jay was talking with Kim when Gal appeared beside him. She touched his arm.
"Jay. You look amazing tonight."
"Thank you."
"Can I get you a drink?" she asked.
"I'm fine, thank you."
"Are you sure? I'm going to the bar anyway."
"I'm sure."
"Come sit with me." She tugged at his sleeve. Her fingers pressed against his wrist.
"Gal, maybe you should have some water."
"I don't want water. I want to talk to you."
"How are you enjoying the party?" he asked politely.
"It's nice. But I'd rather talk to you."
"You should mingle. Get to know everyone."
"I'd rather get to know you better."
The way she said it made Jay's stomach drop. There was no mistaking her intention now.
"Gal—"
"Do you want to step outside? It's quieter on the terrace."
"I'm fine here."
"Just for a few minutes. We never get to talk at work."
"That's because we're working."
"Exactly. So now we can actually have a conversation."
Jay looked around for help. Luc had moved to another group. Amy was deep in conversation with Liv. Max was nowhere to be seen.
"Gal—"
"I think about you all the time. At work. At home. You're so—"
"Gal, you've had too much to drink."
"I know what I'm saying." She leaned against him. "I really like you."
Then he saw Ian across the room. Ian was watching him. Their eyes met. Ian set down his drink and walked over.
"Excuse me. I need to speak with Jay."
"Oh. Can it wait? We were just—"
"No. It's urgent."
Ian placed a hand on Jay's shoulder and guided him away. Gal stood there, looking hurt and confused.
They walked through the crowd and out onto the terrace. The night air was warm and still. City lights glittered in the distance. The sounds of the party were muted here.
Jay took a deep breath. "Thank you."
"Are you alright?"
"Yes. She's just... persistent."
"She's inappropriate."
"She's young. She doesn't understand boundaries."
"She understands perfectly well. She's choosing to ignore them."
They stood at the railing, looking out at the city. Jay was acutely aware of Ian beside him. Close enough to touch.
"I feel bad for her," Jay said.
"Don't."
"She's probably embarrassed. Struggling to fit in."
"Jay. What she's doing isn't acceptable. Following you around. Bringing you coffee uninvited. Asking personal questions. Trying to get you alone. That's not struggling to fit in. That's harassment."
"It's not that serious—"
"It is exactly that serious. Just because she's young and short doesn't make it not harassment. If she was a two-meter-tall man doing the same things, how would you feel?"
Ian was right. If it was a large, imposing man hounding him like this, Jay would be terrified.
"You're right. I didn't think of it that way."
"No one should be pursued like this. Male, female, doesn't matter. It's not appropriate. And I won't tolerate it on my team."
"What are you going to do?"
"I'll speak with her Monday. Make it clear this behaviour needs to stop."
"She'll hate me."
"She'll be embarrassed. But that's not your responsibility. You've done nothing wrong."
Jay looked at Ian. The city lights illuminated his face—sharp features, composed expression. But there was concern in his eyes. Protectiveness.
"Thank you for helping."
They stood there in silence. Jay could smell Ian's cologne—deep and sensual. It was intoxicating. He wanted to move closer, to close the distance between them.
Ian was rescuing him again, like a knight in shining armour. Like someone who cared deeply about his well-being. Jay's heart ached with the realization he could no longer deny.
He was in love with this man. Deeply, completely, hopelessly in love.
Not just admiration. Not respect or gratitude. Love. The kind that made it hard to breathe when Ian stood this close.
"We should go back inside," Ian said.
"In a moment."
They stayed on the terrace a little longer. The party continued without them. Jay memorized this moment—the night air, the city lights, Ian beside him in the darkness. Neither of them wanted to go back inside. Neither of them wanted this moment to end.
When they finally returned, Gal was gone.
"She left," Luc said when Jay asked. "She looked upset. Nearly crying."
Jay felt guilty, but Ian was right. What she'd been doing wasn't acceptable. She needed to learn that.
The party continued. Jay talked with more colleagues, drank another glass of wine, but his thoughts were elsewhere. On the terrace. On Ian's cologne. On the way Ian had placed a hand on his shoulder and guided him away.
Jay left around eleven, when people began drifting out, calling goodbyes, making plans for the weekend. He walked to the metro station with Luc and Rin.
"That was fun," Rin said. "Though I ate too many appetizers."
"I'm going to sleep for twelve hours," Luc said.
They parted ways at the station. Jay took the train home alone. He entered his apartment, turned on a single lamp, changed out of his suit, and sat on the couch.
The burgundy blanket was folded on the armchair—the one Ian had used when he'd stayed over. Jay picked it up and held it to his face.
It still held traces of Ian's scent. Faint now, but unmistakable.
Jay lay down on the couch and pulled the blanket over himself. He buried his face in the fabric and tried to breathe normally.
But he couldn't. His chest felt tight, his heart too large for his ribcage.
Ian was so perfect. So tender and lovely. The way he'd noticed Jay's discomfort. The way he protected Jay from things Jay didn't even realize he needed protection from.
How could Jay go on with his life when his heart was swallowed whole by these feelings?
How could he sit across from Ian every day, see him through the glass wall, work beside him during late evenings, and pretend he didn't feel this way? How could he survive loving someone who would never love him back?
Jay curled tighter around the blanket. Ian was everything Jay had ever wanted and everything he could never have. The impossibility of it crushed him. He lay there in the darkness, breathing in the fading scent of Ian's cologne, and let himself fall apart.
He cried quietly. Not dramatic, heaving sobs. Just silent tears sliding down his face, soaking into the burgundy fabric.
He loved Ian. He loved him so completely it hurt.
And there was nothing he could do about it. Nothing except continue as he had been. Working beside him. Accepting whatever small moments of closeness Ian offered. Pretending his heart wasn't breaking every single day.
Eventually, exhaustion pulled him under. He fell asleep on the couch, still clutching the blanket, still breathing in the ghost of Ian's scent.
In his dreams, they were on the terrace again. But this time Ian didn't step back. This time Ian moved closer, cupped Jay's face in his hands, and—
Jay woke with a start. Dawn light filtered through the windows. The blanket had slipped to the floor.
He sat up slowly, disoriented and hollow. His eyes felt swollen. The dream faded, leaving only the cold reality of morning. Jay got up and folded the blanket. He returned it to the armchair where it belonged.
Then he went to the bathroom and washed his face. In the mirror, he looked tired and sad. He made coffee and sat on the balcony. The city was waking up around him. The river sparkled in the morning light.
He thought about Ian twelve minutes away. Probably still asleep. Probably never thinking about Jay the way Jay thought about him.
It hurt. It would always hurt, but Jay would endure it. Because being near Ian, even with this impossible love, was better than not being near him at all.
Scene 4
I notice what you need
Saturday's gym visit brought Jay some relief. The exercise cleared his mind, burning away the fog of emotions.
Rus found him at the weight rack. "Birthday coming up, right?"
"Tomorrow."
"Any plans?"
"Not particularly. My family is coming next week to stay over the weekend."
"We should make a party then. Get everyone together. Celebrate properly."
Jay was sceptical. "I don't need a party."
"Everyone needs a party once in a while."
"I'm not really a party person."
"I know. But think about it. Just drinks at a bar. Nothing elaborate."
"My siblings are still children. I don't think—"
"Perfect. We'll make it fun for everyone." Rus was smiling a devious smile.
"Rus—"
"Trust me. It'll be great."
Jay didn't commit, but Rus looked pleased anyway, like he'd already decided it was happening.
After the gym, Jay went shopping for clothes. He needed to look nice for Ian's visit. But not obvious that he was trying so hard. Not desperate. He visited four different boutiques. The first three didn't have what he was looking for. Everything was either too casual or too formal. Too bright or too dull.
At the fourth shop, he found cream trousers and a dark green shirt. The trousers fit perfectly. The shirt was well-cut, flattering without being ostentatious. He bought them and went home.
Sunday was his birthday. He woke early and cleaned the apartment to perfection. He wiped down surfaces, organized the kitchen, arranged books on the shelf. Everything had to be just right.
At noon, he showered and got dressed. He checked his reflection multiple times. Too much? Not enough? It seemed acceptable.
Ian arrived at two in the afternoon. Jay heard the knock and opened the door.
Ian stood in the hallway holding a large package. He was dressed casually—dark trousers, a light blue shirt, no tie.
"Happy birthday," Ian said.
"Thank you. Come in."
Ian entered and set the package on the kitchen counter. "I hope you like it."
"You didn't have to go to so much trouble."
"It was no trouble."
They stood in the kitchen. Jay gestured to the package.
"Should I open it?"
"Please."
Jay removed the wrapping. Inside was a coffee maker—sleek, compact, elegant. White with chrome accents. The brand name meant nothing to him.
"I like and trust the brand. I've had mine for years. It's reliable and makes excellent coffee."
There were also several bags of different coffee blends. Dark roast, medium roast, something labeled "morning blend," another called "evening decaf."
"I didn't know which you'd prefer, so I brought a selection."
Jay stared at it. "This is too much."
"You mentioned wanting a coffee maker but not knowing which to choose. I thought I could help."
"Thank you."
"Shall we set it up?"
They unpacked the machine together. Ian explained the functions, showed him how to fill the water reservoir, how to adjust the strength settings. Within fifteen minutes, they had it running.
"Let's try it," Ian said.
They made coffee and took their cups to the balcony. The weather was beautiful, warm and clear. The river sparkled in the afternoon sun. Jay sipped his coffee. It was excellent.
"How do you feel? After yesterday," Ian asked.
"I'm fine."
"Gal's behaviour was unacceptable. I'll speak with her Monday."
"You don't need to—"
"Yes, I do. This can't happen again."
Jay felt a complicated mix of emotions. Guilt for Gal. Gratitude toward Ian. And underneath it all, the aching awareness that Ian was protecting him again.
"Thank you for intervening."
"It was necessary."
They drank their coffee. Jay was shaken for an entirely different reason than Ian thought. Not because of Gal's harassment. But because of this—sitting on his balcony with Ian, drinking coffee from a machine Ian had chosen for him, feeling the weight of impossible love pressing against his ribs.
"This coffee is really good," Jay said, desperate to change the subject.
"I'm glad you like it."
The afternoon stretched on. Ian stayed, and they kept talking. About work, about the upcoming week, about nothing in particular. The conversation was comfortable, like the retreat, like those long winter evenings in the office.
"I've been trying to run," Jay confessed at one point. "Along the river. But I'm terrible at it."
"How so?"
"My form is awful. I get winded immediately. I feel ridiculous."
"Running takes practice. It's not something you just know how to do."
"You run, don't you?"
"I used to run regularly. I don't do it often these days."
"You make it seem effortless."
Ian smiled slightly. "It's not. But I've been doing it for years. I could give you tips if you'd like. We could run together one of these days."
Jay's heart skipped. "You'd do that?"
"Of course. I'd welcome a change of pace from the gym."
"That would be helpful. Thank you."
They finished their coffee and Jay made more. It was late afternoon when Ian finally got up to leave.
"I should go. Let you enjoy the rest of your birthday."
"Thank you for coming. And for the gift. It's wonderful."
"I'm glad."
They walked to the door. Ian paused in the hallway.
"Happy birthday, Jay. I hope this year brings you everything you want."
"Thank you."
They looked at each other. Jay wanted to say so much. That having Ian here had made his birthday wonderful. That he wished Ian could stay. But he said nothing. 
Ian smiled and left.
Jay closed the door and leaned against it. The apartment felt empty.
He looked at the coffee maker sitting on his counter. A gift that said "I pay attention. I notice what you need."
Ian had stayed for hours, and he had no idea how much it meant. No idea that every moment with him was both a gift and an agony.
Jay's eyes burned. He went to the couch and picked up the burgundy blanket. He pulled it around his shoulders and sat there as evening fell, wishing things could be different.
Meanwhile, Ian drove home wistfully. He kept thinking about how Jay had looked today. How comfortable Jay seemed in his new home. How domestic it had felt, sitting on the balcony drinking coffee together.
Jay had found peace here. A beautiful apartment, a stable career, confidence in himself. Ian would do anything to protect that peace Jay had found. Anything to keep him safe and happy. Even if it meant never telling Jay how he felt. Even if it meant watching from a distance as Jay eventually found someone else.
Because Jay deserved happiness. Ian would protect that possibility, whatever the cost.
He parked in his building's garage and took the elevator up to his apartment. The space felt cold after the warmth of Jay's home.
Ian poured himself a drink and stood by the window. Twelve minutes away, Jay was probably making dinner. Maybe trying out the coffee maker again. Maybe thinking about the week ahead.
Ian hoped he was happy. Hoped the birthday had been good. Hoped Jay knew how much he was valued, even if Ian could never say it the way he wanted to.
Scene 5
Complications
On Monday, Ian had a talk with Gal behind closed doors first thing in the morning. It lasted fifteen minutes. When she emerged, her face was blotchy and red. She went straight to the bathroom. She clearly cried there.
When she returned to her desk, she started acting erratically. Dropping files with a thud. Getting up suddenly and leaving the office without a word. She didn't go out for lunch with the rest of the team. She sat at her desk, eating something from a plastic container, not talking to anyone.
Jay felt guilty. If he'd had better social skills, this situation wouldn't have needed to come to this. If he'd been clearer from the start, discouraged her more effectively—
Ian appeared at his desk during the afternoon.
"Do you have a moment?"
"Of course."
They went to Ian's office. Ian closed the door.
"I wanted to let you know I spoke with Gal this morning. Made it very clear that her behaviour needs to change immediately."
"She seemed upset."
"She was. But that's not your concern."
"I feel responsible—"
"You're not. This is my responsibility. You did nothing wrong. I'll deal with whatever problems arise."
Jay looked at him. Ian's expression was gentle, like he'd shoulder any burden to keep Jay safe. Jay felt something melt in his chest. 
"Thank you," Jay said.
Jay tended to stay late on Mondays. There was always additional work that piled up during the weekend, even during slower periods. But that day he left with the rest of the team after five.
Everyone was relieved the difficult reporting period was behind them and they could finally live like normal people. Luc stretched dramatically. Kim mentioned plans to catch up on sleep. Jay nodded along. But privately, he didn't stay because the situation weighed on him. His feelings, the trouble at work, all of it compounding to make him feel troubled.
He went for a long walk through his new neighbourhood to clear his head. The evening was warm, the streets busy with people finishing their workdays. He walked along the river, then through residential streets.
He'd never been one to rely on other people for protection. He'd always tried to carry his burdens himself. It was safer that way. Less disappointing when people inevitably let you down.
But with Ian, it felt natural. Ian was someone who solved problems, who shielded others, who stood at the helm and weathered whatever storms came his way. Reliable, unbreakable.
More than that, Jay wanted to be protected by him. It didn't hurt his pride or make him feel less. It made him feel cared for. And it was an intoxicating feeling.
He walked until the light began to fade, then returned home. He made dinner and sat on the balcony, thinking about his life.
On Tuesday, the atmosphere was even tenser. Gal had ceased sighing and moping. Instead, she'd turned passive-aggressive.
She responded to questions with technically correct answers that somehow managed to sound hostile. When Zoe asked her to review a file, she said "Fine" in a curt tone. When Rin accidentally bumped her desk, she glared at him.
The old workers just rolled their eyes and ignored her moods. Max remained jovial and unbothered, Kim made a comment under his breath that made Ela snort.
But Rin was clearly bothered by it. He laughed nervously and tried to get out of Gal's way, moving around the office like he was on a minefield.
Meanwhile, at lunch, Luc was being weird.
"So Jay. What kind of food do you like?"
"What?"
"For eating. What's your preference?"
"I don't have one particular favourite."
"But if you had to choose. What would you want?"
"Why are you asking?"
"Just curious. And what about venues? Do you like loud places or quieter ones?"
Jay narrowed his eyes. "What are you planning?"
"Nothing. Just making conversation. Tell me about your family. How many siblings do you have?"
"Three."
"Ages?"
"Luc, what is this?"
"Just getting to know you better."
Jay didn't believe him for a second.
Later that afternoon, Luc was not-so-secretly convening with Zoe and Ian in Ian's office behind closed doors. Through the glass wall, Jay watched them. Luc was gesticulating wildly, pointing at Jay repeatedly. Zoe was nodding. Ian looked patient but slightly resigned.
Jay was unhappy the doors provided decent soundproofing because he was certain they were scheming.
At three, Ian sent him a text.
"Meet me in Conference Room B in ten minutes."
Jay went at the appointed time. Ian was already there, seated at the table with a look that made it clear he was about to deliver bad news.
"What's happening?" Jay asked.
"Apparently Rus contacted Luc about your birthday party."
Jay's heart sank. "Oh no."
"Luc is being very spirited about it. He and Zoe are organizing it for Saturday. It's not exactly a secret, but they fully intend to organize everything and present you with a fait accompli."
"Of course they do."
"I'm against the surprise aspect. If you don't want this, I will very much effectively dissuade them from the idea."
Jay sighed dramatically and shook his head in resignation. As if he didn't already have enough on his plate. His overeager friends had decided to make things with his family awkward.
"Let them do what they want. I can drag my mom and siblings to a pub for an hour. What's the worst that can happen? At least Rus and Luc won't be nagging me for the rest of my life for being antisocial."
"Are you sure?"
"Yes. They clearly want to do this. I'm not going to fight them on it."
"Alright."
"You're free to come as well. Since they roped you into it. If you feel like it, naturally."
"I'll be there."
Jay nodded and got up to leave. Ian watched him with worry.
"Are you alright?" Ian asked.
"Fine. Just tired."
Ian could see that Jay was in a peculiar mood. He blamed the Gal situation for it. The tension in the office, the guilt Jay clearly felt despite having done nothing wrong.
Ian resolved to deal with the situation quickly. He'd just let Gal go. She was on a probation contract anyway, like any new hire. It wasn't a problem legally or procedurally. But he decided to wait until the end of the month. He didn't want to make ripples and make Jay feel even more guilty before his family arrived. At least this way, Jay would hopefully have a good time that weekend.
Jay spent the rest of the week leaving at five with the rest of the team. He went shopping for groceries, cleaned his apartment again, prepared for his family's visit. On Wednesday, he bought fresh linens for the guest bed. 
Thursday evening, he returned straight home to cook. His mother had called to say they'd departed at two in the afternoon, so they should arrive around six or seven. He intended to welcome them with a homemade meal.
Chapter 40: The storm before the calm
Scene 1
Family visit
Jay stood in the kitchen, checking the oven one last time. The roast chicken was golden brown, the vegetables caramelized at the edges. The soup simmered on the stove, filling the apartment with the scent of herbs and broth. He'd made the kinds of things his mother used to cook when he was young. Simple, hearty food that tasted like home.
His phone buzzed at quarter to seven.
"We're five minutes away," his mother texted.
Jay grabbed his keys and headed downstairs. The evening air was pleasant. He waited at the entrance, watching the traffic until his mother's car pulled up to the curb. The doors opened and chaos erupted.
"Jay!" Ema was the first out, running toward him with her arms outstretched.
"Look at you. Did you grow taller?"
"Maybe a little."
Tim emerged next, followed by Ari, both stretching after the long drive. His mother climbed out last, looking tired but happy.
"There's underground parking. Follow me."
He led them around to the garage entrance, waving at the security camera as the gate rolled open. His mother followed him down the ramp, eyes widening at the spotless garage with its bright lights and neatly numbered bays. Jay walked ahead, gesturing toward a reserved space marked with his name.
“This one’s ours,” he said.
She parked, still taking in the polished surroundings, while the boys jumped out to start unloading the bags from the trunk.
"I can carry mine," Ema insisted, dragging her backpack.
"Let me help," Jay said, taking the heavier cases.
They piled into the elevator. Ari pressed the button for the fourth floor and grinned when the doors closed smoothly.
"This is so fancy," Tim said.
"It's new construction. Everything's still shiny," Jay explained.
The elevator opened into a bright hallway with clean white walls. Jay unlocked his door and held it open.
"Welcome."
They came in, dropping bags and shoes in the entryway. Ema ran straight to the windows.
"You can see the river!"
"And the park. Come on, I'll show you around."
The apartment wasn't large, but it felt spacious. His mother walked through slowly, running her hand along the countertop in the open kitchen.
"It's beautiful. So clean and bright."
Tim and Ari immediately zeroed in on the entertainment console beneath the television.
"Is that the new model?" Tim asked.
"It is."
"Can we play later?"
"After dinner."
Ema was still at the window, pressing her hands against the glass. "I love this view. Can I take pictures?"
"Take as many as you want."
His mother opened the refrigerator, inspecting the contents with approval. "You're eating properly. That's good."
"I cook most nights now."
"I'm glad to hear it. The place suits you. Tidy, organized, but cosy."
"Thank you."
"Now, what smells so good?"
"Dinner's ready. Sit down, I'll serve."
They gathered around the small dining table, which Jay had extended to its full length. He brought out the soup first, ladling it into bowls. Then the chicken, potatoes, and roasted vegetables.
"This looks amazing," his mother said.
"I wanted to make something homey."
They ate with enthusiasm. Ema described her school play. Tim talked about his football team making the regional finals. Ari complained about his maths teacher but admitted he was doing well in history.
"And how's work?" his mother asked Jay.
"Busy. We just finished quarterly reporting."
"That sounds stressful."
"It was. But it's over now."
"Your boss treats you well?"
"Very well. Ian's excellent."
"I'm glad."
After dinner, Ema retrieved a bag from the entryway. "We brought presents."
"You didn't have to—"
"Housewarming and birthday. Open them."
She handed him three painted cache pots, each decorated by one of his siblings. Ema's was covered in tiny flowers and vines. Tim's featured abstract geometric patterns in blue and silver. Ari's had bold orange stripes on a green background.
"We made them for your plant," Ema explained. 
Jay looked at the pots, then at his siblings. "These are wonderful. Thank you."
His mother produced a wrapped package next. "From me."
Inside was a set of high grade kitchen knives. Beneath them were jars of homemade jam and a container of cookies.
"Mom, this is too much—"
"Nonsense. You need good tools if you're cooking regularly. And I know you like my preserves."
Jay set the jars on the counter, then picked up the orange-and-green pot. It was garish and loud, completely unlike anything else in his apartment. But it had been painted by his youngest brother with care.
He retrieved his spider plant and put into the pot. The colours clashed magnificently with the tones of the room, but somehow it worked.
"Looks great," Ema declared.
"It really does," Jay agreed.
They loaded the dishwasher together, his mother insisting on helping despite Jay's protests. Tim and Ari wiped down the counters. Then came the question of sleeping arrangements.
"You and Ema take the bedroom. Tim and Ari can have the couch. I'll sleep on the floor."
"That's not fair to you—"
"It's fine. I've already set everything up."
He showed them the mattress he'd arranged, tucked beside the table with pillows and blankets. It looked cosy enough.
His mother relented. "If you're sure."
"I am."
They prepared for bed. The boys claimed the bathroom first, emerging in sleep clothes and immediately commandeering the console. Ema and his mother took longer.
Jay showered last and returned to find Tim and Ari deeply engaged in a racing game.
"Don't stay up too late," he said.
"We won't."
His mother appeared in the doorway, already in her nightgown. "This is a lovely apartment, Jay. Really. I'm so proud of you."
"Thanks, Mom."
"Sleep well."
"You too."
Jay retreated to his makeshift bed. It was a bit cramped, and he could hear the boys' game, but he didn't mind. He closed his eyes and let the sounds of his family lull him to sleep.
The next morning began with breakfast. Jay made scrambled eggs and toast.
"What's the plan?" Tim asked.
"City tour. I'll show you around. Then lunch, and we'll visit my old neighbourhood."
"Can we ride the metro?" Ari asked.
"Of course."
They left at ten, stepping out into a perfect June day. The weather was warm but not oppressive, with a light breeze coming off the river. Jay led them through the park to the metro station.
"This is so much nicer than our trains," Ema said, marvelling at the clean platforms and modern carriages.
When they reached their stop, Jay led them toward the Northlight Financial Center. The glass tower gleamed in the sunlight, imposing and elegant.
"That's where I work. Thirty-fourth floor."
"It's huge," Tim said.
"Can we go inside?" Ema asked.
"Just the lobby."
They entered through the main doors. The reception area was all marble and polished metal, with a massive chandelier hanging overhead. The receptionist at the desk looked up and smiled.
"Good morning, Mr. Hall." She waved at them cheerfully. His siblings stared.
"She knows your name?" Ari whispered.
"I come through here every day."
"That's so cool."
They didn't linger. Jay ushered them back outside before anyone else could recognize him. His family was impressed enough already.
"Ice cream?" he asked.
"Yes!" Ema said immediately.
He took them to a small artisanal shop near the park, the one with flavours like lavender honey and brown butter. They each chose different ones and ate while walking through the paths. 
"This is really good," his mother said, savouring her pistachio cone.
"I come here sometimes after work."
"It must be nice, living so close to everything."
"It is."
For lunch, he brought them to Willow & Sage. The bistro was busy but they found a table by the window. Jay recommended the seasonal soup and the chicken sandwich. His mother ordered the quiche. The food was excellent, as always. His mother declared the quiche the best she'd ever had. The boys finished their sandwiches quickly and eyed the dessert menu.
"Maybe late. We have more to see."
They walked through the financial district. His siblings took photos of the skyscrapers. Then they took the metro to the old town, emerging in the neighbourhood where Jay had lived when he first moved to the city. The streets were narrower here, the buildings older but charming.
"I rented a studio in that building," Jay said, pointing. "Fourth floor, no elevator."
"How small was it?" Ari asked.
"Very small."
They visited the history museum, which Ari found fascinating, and took photos in front of the landmark statues in the main square.
"One more stop," Jay said.
He led them to Café Lemon. Fay was behind the counter, and she lit up when she saw him.
"Jay! And you brought guests."
"My family. This is my mom, and my siblings—Ema, Tim, and Ari."
"Wonderful to meet you all. What can I get you?"
They ordered tea and pastries. Fay brought everything to their table personally, along with an extra plate of biscuits.
"On the house," she said.
They sat for a while, relaxing after the long day of walking. By the time they left, it was late afternoon. Jay hailed a taxi to take them back across the city. The kids were tired but happy. Jay took them to an upscale restaurant near his building for dinner. Ema looked nervous.
Jay ordered for the table, choosing dishes he knew his family would enjoy. The meal was excellent. His mother praised everything. The kids were on their best behaviour.
After dinner, they walked along the riverside boulevard. The evening was beautiful. Ema and Tim took endless selfies. Ari asked questions about the buildings and Jay answered as best he could. They found a small pier with a fountain and benches arranged around it. 
"My feet are definitely going to fall off," Ema said dramatically, dropping onto a bench.
The boys sat on either side of her. Jay and his mother took the bench opposite. For a few minutes, they just rested. Then his mother spoke.
"I'm very proud of you, Jay. When you first moved here, I worried. You were so young. But look at you now. You have a beautiful home, a good job. You've built a real life here."
"I've been lucky. I found a great job. Good fortune followed."
"It's not just luck. You worked hard. You persevered through difficult times. You should be proud of yourself."
"Thank you, Mom. Let's head home before it gets too late."
By the time they reached the apartment, everyone was thoroughly exhausted.
"Tomorrow I'll take you shopping. You can each pick a birthday present."
"Really?" Ema's eyes lit up.
"Really. Within reason."
"What's reason?" Ari asked.
"You'll find out. Also, my colleagues are planning a small birthday thing tomorrow evening. Just an hour or so at a pub."
"Your work friends?" his mother asked.
"Yes. They insisted on organizing it. I hope that's alright."
"Of course. It sounds lovely."
They prepared for bed again. Jay lay on his mattress on the floor, self-conscious about all the praise, but underneath that, he felt the comfort of having people who cared about him close by.
Scene 2
Affection
Saturday morning began with the chaos of four people trying to use one bathroom. Jay made breakfast while waiting for his turn, scrambling eggs and toasting bread. Ema was already planning her shopping strategy.
"I want to look at everything before deciding," she announced.
"That'll take hours," Tim said.
"So?"
"So the rest of us will die of boredom."
"Then don't come with me."
"We're all going together," their mother said firmly. "And you'll be reasonable about what you choose."
Ema sighed dramatically but nodded.
They took his mother's car, Jay navigating from the passenger seat. The mall was busy but manageable. Ema made a beeline for the clothing stores.
"Can I get a dress?" she asked.
"You can get whatever you want."
Her eyes went wide. His mother immediately intervened.
"Within reason. You don't need six dresses."
"But they're all so pretty—"
"Pick two. And maybe a nice top."
They spent an hour in various shops while Ema deliberated. Tim and Ari sat on a bench outside the store, playing on their phones.
She tried on everything, asked everyone's opinion, changed her mind repeatedly. Eventually she decided on a floral sundress and a more formal navy one, plus a blouse with embroidered sleeves.
The boys were more decisive. Tim wanted new trekking boots and a jersey. Ari asked for books and a model ship kit. 
"You're spoiling them," his mother said.
They loaded their bags into the car and returned to the mall's food court for lunch. The siblings were thrilled with their gifts.
Jay's phone buzzed while he was eating.
"I need to inform you that I'm collecting your family at three. We're going shopping for proper attire before the event." Luc's text read.
Jay stared at the message. His stomach sank.
"What's wrong?" his mother asked.
"Nothing. Just work."
He called Luc back, stepping away from the table.
"What do you mean, proper attire?"
"It's a nice venue. They need nice clothes."
"This is supposed to be casual—"
"It is casual. Casually upscale. Trust me, they'll thank me later."
"Luc—"
"Three o'clock. Don't argue."
The call ended. Jay returned to the table, trying not to look annoyed.
"Everything alright?" his mother asked.
"Fine. My colleague wants to take you shopping this afternoon before the party."
"That's not necessary—"
"I know. But he's insistent."
They finished lunch and returned to the apartment to drop off the bags. Jay had barely set everything down when the intercom buzzed.
"Hello?"
"It's Luc. Let me up."
Jay buzzed him in. A minute later, there was a knock on the door. Jay opened it.
Luc stood there with Leo.
"Hello. We're here for the makeover," Leo said with a huge grin.
Jay stared. "Why are you here?"
"I'm helping."
"That's not an explanation."
"Can we come in?"
Jay stepped aside, deeply suspicious. His family gathered in the living room, looking uncertain.
"This is Luc and Leo. They work with me. Apparently they're taking you shopping."
Leo immediately approached Jay's mother with his most charming smile.
"You must be Mrs. Hall. I'm Leo Turner. Lovely to meet you."
"Oh. Hello."
"And you must be Ema, Tim, and Ari. Jay's told us so much about you."
"He has?" Ema asked.
"Constantly. He's very proud of you all."
Jay felt a headache forming. He grabbed Leo's arm and pulled him into the kitchen bedroom.
"What are you really doing here?"
Leo's smile didn't waver. "Can't I just want to celebrate your birthday?"
"No."
"Fine. I have an ulterior motive."
"I knew it."
"Ian turns forty in September. That's a big milestone. He needs a proper celebration."
"He hates parties."
"Exactly. Which is why I need to soften him up to the idea first. Tonight seems like a perfect opportunity. Small gathering, casual atmosphere. He'll see it's not so terrible."
"You're using my birthday party to manipulate Ian into tolerating his own birthday party?"
"When you say it like that, it sounds bad."
"Because it is bad."
"Jay, listen. Ian never celebrates anything. He never lets anyone do anything nice for him. He spends every birthday working late and pretending it's just another day. Don't you think he deserves better?"
Jay wanted to argue, but he couldn't, because Leo was right.
"He needs more in his life than just work," Leo continued. "You know that as well as I do. Maybe better. So help me out here. Let tonight be a test run. Show him that gatherings with friends can actually be pleasant."
Jay sighed. "Fine. Do whatever you want."
They returned to the living room. Luc had already charmed Jay's siblings and was explaining the plan.
"We'll split up. I'll take Tim and Ari. Leo will take Mrs. Hall and Ema. That way we can cover more ground."
"What about Jay?" his mother asked.
"Ian's picking him up at six. Jay, wear something nice."
Jay's mother looked at him questioningly. Jay nodded.
"Alright then," she said.
Before Jay could protest further, they were herding his family out the door. Ema waved enthusiastically. His mother looked bemused.
The door closed and the apartment fell silent. Jay sighed heavily and checked the time. Two hours.
He tidied up the apartment, then he showered, taking his time.
When he emerged, he dried off and went to his closet. The navy three-piece suit was the obvious choice. He dressed up, adding the sapphire cufflinks and matching tiepin. His hair had been cut recently and still held its shape. He combed it, checking his reflection.
He looked presentable. Hopefully not overdressed.
At quarter to six, he sat on the couch and waited, hoping this wouldn't turn into a disaster. The buzzer rang at ten minutes before six.
Jay opened the door. Ian stood there in a pale gray suit, looking dashing.
"Hello," Ian said.
"Hi. Come in."
Ian stepped inside, closing the door behind him. "You look very nice."
"Thanks. I'm sorry about all this. Luc turned it into an entire production."
"That's Luc's nature."
"I know, but still. It was supposed to be casual." Jay caught himself before he complained too much. The whole point was to get Ian comfortable with celebrations. "I mean, it's fine. I'm sure it'll be nice."
"I'm sure it will be."
Ian reached into his jacket and produced a small wrapped box.
"What's that?"
"A gift."
"You already gave me a gift."
"That was for your home. But since there's a party, I couldn't arrive empty-handed."
"Ian—"
"Please."
Jay took the box and unwrapped it. Inside was a set of cufflinks and a tiepin, white gold and onyx. The design was modern, geometric, more serious than the sapphire set.
"These are beautiful," Jay whispered.
"I thought they'd suit you."
Jay felt heat rise in his face. It wasn't the first time Ian had given him a gift, but this moment felt different, more weighted. His heart was beating too fast.
"Thank you," he managed.
He tried to remove the sapphire cufflinks he was wearing, but his hands trembled slightly. He fumbled with the mechanism.
"Here," Ian said gently. "Let me."
He took Jay's wrist, removing the cufflink. Then the other one. He replaced them with the new set.
Jay stood frozen, watching Ian's hands work. The touch was light, but the intimacy of the gesture made his breath catch.
Ian finished with the cufflinks and reached for the tiepin.
"May I?"
Jay nodded, not trusting his voice.
Ian removed the sapphire pin and replaced it with the onyx one, adjusting it so it sat perfectly straight. His fingers brushed Jay's chest through the fabric.
"There," Ian said.
Jay looked up and found Ian watching him. Their faces were close. Then Ian stepped back.
"We should go."
"Yes," Jay agreed, his voice slightly unsteady.
They left the apartment together. Ian's car was parked at the curb. He opened the passenger door for Jay.
Jay watched the city pass outside the window, acutely aware of Ian beside him. His wrist still felt warm where Ian had touched it. His hands were still trembling.
"Are you nervous?" Ian asked.
"A little. My family meeting my colleagues feels strange."
"They'll get along well."
"I hope so."
Jay glanced at Ian's profile, at his hands resting on the steering wheel.
He thought about those same hands fastening his cufflinks, adjusting the tiepin. The focused expression on Ian's face, the gentleness of his touch. Jay looked away quickly, his heart racing again.
This was dangerous territory. He knew that. But it felt like something more than mentorship.
It felt like affection.
Ian pulled into a parking space near the venue. He turned off the engine but didn't immediately move to leave.
"Jay."
"Yes?"
"I hope you have a good evening. You deserve to be celebrated."
"Thank you. For everything. Not just tonight. For all of it."
"It's my pleasure."
They sat for a moment longer, then Ian opened his door. "Shall we?"
"Yes."
They walked to the venue together, close but not touching, both maintaining the line neither was brave enough to cross.
Scene 3
Celebration
Jay stopped in his tracks when he saw the restaurant's entrance.
"The Palladium."
"Yes."
"Did Leo organized this?"
"I believe so."
Jay pushed through the doors and immediately spotted Leo holding a glass of wine near the private dining room entrance. He sent him a vicious glare. Leo smiled innocently and raised his glass in greeting.
The private room was elegant without being oppressively formal, servers moving discreetly between guests. Still, it was one of the most expensive restaurants in the city.
"Jay!"
His mother approached, and Jay barely recognized her. She wore a deep green dress that skimmed her knees, her hair styled and wearing makeup. Ema was beside her in a cream-coloured dress with delicate beading, looking thrilled with herself.
"You both look beautiful," Jay said.
"Leo's stylist was very skilled," his mother said. There was wariness in her voice, like she wasn't entirely comfortable with the situation.
Tim and Ari appeared next, both in well-cut suits that somehow managed to look relaxed despite being clearly designer. Tim tugged at his collar.
"These are really comfortable. I thought fancy suits were supposed to be stiff."
"You look very handsome," Jay assured him.
His mother stepped back, examining Jay with obvious pride. "Look at you. So refined."
"Mom—"
"You look like you belong here," Ema added.
"I don't know about that—"
"You do. I'm so proud," his mother insisted.
"Thank you."
Rus appeared, grinning widely, wearing a burgundy shirt and black trousers that actually fit properly. Beside him, Mic and Van were similarly well-dressed.
"Luc's work?" Jay asked.
"Obviously. Happy birthday."
"Thanks."
Luc himself was near the bar with his flatmate Gav. He waved at Jay. Most of Jay's colleagues were already present—Zoe, Amy, Max, Ela, and Kim clustered together near the windows. And Rin, standing awkwardly in the corner by himself.
Jay made his way over.
"Rin. I'm glad you came."
Rin looked relieved. "Luc said I should. I hope that's alright."
"Of course it is."
"I wasn't sure if—since I'm still new—"
"You're part of the team. Stay as long as you like."
Rin relaxed slightly.
Jay's mother approached, watching the exchange. After Rin wandered toward the drinks table, she whispered.
"That young man works for you?"
"He's a junior analyst. I've been helping him."
"You have subordinates." She sounded surprised.
Ian stood near the entrance, surveying the room. Jay's mother looked at him. Her expression cooled slightly.
"That's your boss."
"Yes. Ian Hagen."
"He seems very formal."
Ian noticed them and approached. "Mrs. Carter. It's a pleasure to meet you properly."
"Mr. Hagen." Her tone was polite but notably lacking in warmth.
"I hope you're enjoying the city."
"Jay's been an excellent guide."
"I'm sure he has."
There was a pause. Jay could feel the tension, the way his mother's shoulders had gone slightly rigid. Ian seemed to sense it too. He didn't push for more conversation, simply inclined his head and said, "Please let me know if you need anything this evening."
"Thank you."
He moved away, giving them space. Jay watched him go, then looked at his mother.
"He's a good person."
"I'm sure he is."
"Mom—"
"I'm being polite, aren't I?"
"You're being vigilant."
"Rich, powerful men don't do things without reasons, Jay. I just want to make sure his reasons are good ones."
"They are. I promise."
"Alright. I trust your judgement."
The servers began directing people toward their seats. The room had been arranged with several tables, allowing for smaller conversations. Before they sat, Jay caught Ema talking animatedly with Leo, who was telling some story that made her laugh. She pulled out her phone, clearly asking for his social media.
Jay moved quickly.
"Ema—"
"Leo's so interesting! He was just telling me about art galleries."
"That's nice, but—"
"She's a delightful conversationalist," Leo said innocently.
Jay gave him a warning look. Leo's expression remained perfectly pleasant.
"Maybe talk to some other people too."
"I will!"
She bounded off toward the drinks table. Jay turned to Leo.
"Don't be a bad influence."
"I would never."
"I mean it."
"She's perfectly safe with me. I promise."
Jay wasn't entirely convinced, but he couldn't make a scene, so he let it go.
Across the room, Tim was looking lost. Jay went over.
"You alright?"
"Yeah. Just—everyone's very sophisticated."
"You see that woman over there? With the blonde hair? That's Zoe. She likes hiking and camping. You should talk to her."
Tim's face brightened. "Really?"
"Really. Go on."
Tim approached Zoe hesitantly. Within minutes they were deep in conversation, both pulling out their phones to show each other photos. Zoe was gesturing enthusiastically about some trail. Tim was grinning.
Ari, meanwhile, had planted himself firmly behind their mother and showed no signs of moving.
Jay knelt down beside him. "You can sit with me at dinner if you want."
"It's very fancy here."
"I know. But everyone's friendly. And the food will be good."
"Okay."
Jay guided him to the seat beside his own. Ari sat and looked around with wide eyes.
Dinner was served in courses. The food was exceptional, though Jay barely tasted it. He was too busy watching his family and colleagues mingle, making sure everyone was comfortable.
His mother sat with Max and Amy, both of whom were working hard to put her at ease. Max's natural joviality helped. Amy's sincere questions about the family seemed to thaw some of her reserve.
Ema had collected half the room's social media information and was taking endless selfies with anyone who would stand still long enough. Tim and Zoe had become fast friends, now discussing trail safety and wildlife photography. Luc was entertaining Rin, who laughed at something Luc said.
Gav had joined Rus's group and they were all getting progressively louder.
And Ian—
Ian was watching Jay with a tender expression. Their eyes met across the room. Ian smiled. Jay smiled back.
Leo appeared at Ian's shoulder, murmuring something. Ian's expression turned sour immediately. Leo grinned and moved away.
After dinner came the cake, a beautiful three-tiered creation that was absolutely unnecessary but looked spectacular. Everyone sang. Jay endured it with good humour, blowing out the candles while Ema recorded everything on her phone.
Then came the gifts. His colleagues presented a stack of packages that Jay promised to open later. Rus and his friends handed over a big bag that was suspiciously heavy. Gav produced an elegant bottle.
"Thank you," Jay said. "Really. This is too much."
"Nonsense," Max said. 
Jay circulated through the room, receiving wishes and making small talk. He checked on Rin, who was looking less anxious. He thanked Leo for organizing everything, despite his lingering annoyance about the venue choice.
He found Ian standing near the windows.
"How are you holding up?" 
"Very well."
"You're not bored?"
"Not at all."
"My mother's being cold to you. I'm sorry."
"It's alright. She's protective. She has every right to be cautious around someone like me."
"She just—she's not a fan of rich people generally."
"I understand."
"It's not personal."
"I know. She loves you. She wants to make sure you're safe. I respect that."
"Thank you for being here."
They stood together for a moment, watching the party continue around them.
"You're happy," Ian said.
"I am."
"Good. You should be surrounded by people who care about you more often."
"So should you."
Ian's smile turned slightly sad. "Perhaps."
By ten o'clock, people were starting to fade. Ari had fallen asleep with his head on the table. Tim and Ema were still energetic, but their mother looked tired.
"We should head home," Jay said.
"I arranged a car. They'll take you wherever you need to go," Leo said.
"You didn't have to do that," Jay said.
"Of course I did. Can't have you taking the metro after your birthday party."
"Thank you."
"You're welcome. And Jay? I'm glad you had a good time."
"I did. Despite the venue."
"The venue was perfect."
"It was obscenely expensive."
"It was appropriate. Accept nice things graciously."
Jay shook his head but smiled. "Thanks, Leo."
"Happy birthday."
They gathered coats and bags. Jay's colleagues said their goodbyes, each offering warm wishes. Rus hugged him enthusiastically.
"Best party," he declared.
"I'm glad you enjoyed it."
Sunday afternoon arrived too quickly.
Jay's family had packed their bags and loaded the car. They'd had a late lunch together, lingering over the meal as long as possible. Now they stood in the apartment's entryway, ready to leave.
"Drive safely," Jay said.
"We will." His mother hugged him tightly. "Take care of yourself."
"I will."
Ema squeezed him next. "Can I visit again?"
"Anytime."
Tim and Ari both hugged him in turn. Then they were gone. Jay went back inside and started unpacking the birthday gifts. Advanced academic textbooks from his colleagues, topics ranging from financial theory to market analysis. Various pre-workout powders and supplements from Rus, Mic, and Van. A bottle of expensive whiskey from Gav with a note apologizing again for the disastrous blind date.
And an envelope from Leo. Inside was a handwritten note on expensive stationery.
"Happy birthday. Your new jewellery is remarkable and you should have more pieces to properly present it. Appointment scheduled for next Saturday at noon. Don't be late. - L"
It was for the same tailor as last time. Jay stared at the note. He wasn't sure if he was more mad or amused.
Scene 4
Downfall
The week after Jay's birthday party should have been pleasant. Instead, it became increasingly uncomfortable. Gal had stopped hovering around Jay's desk. At first, it seemed like Ian's intervention had worked.
But by Tuesday, Jay noticed something else. Gal was watching him. Waiting for opportunities when he was alone. In the break room. By the printer.
He started avoiding those situations. He started taking coffee back to his desk before she could approach and printing documents only when others were around.
Ian noticed. Jay could see him watching through the glass wall, his expression growing increasingly concerned.
Thursday afternoon, Jay was in the archive room, retrieving files. The space was small, lined with shelves and filing cabinets.
He was reaching for a folder on the top shelf when he heard the door open.
"Jay."
He turned. Gal stepped inside and closed the door.
"Hi," he said cautiously.
"I've been wanting to talk to you."
"I'm a bit busy right now—"
"It won't take long." 
"Gal, this isn't—"
"I just want to know why you're avoiding me."
"I'm not—"
"You are. Ever since Ian spoke to me, you've barely looked at me. Is it because of what I said at the party? Because I was drunk and I didn't mean—"
"It's fine. Really. But I need to get back to work—"
She moved closer. Too close.
"Gal, please step back."
"I just want us to be friends again—"
"We are. But right now I need space."
"Why? What did I do wrong?"
She reached for his arm. Jay pulled away, but the shelves were behind him and there was nowhere to go.
"Don't touch me."
"I'm just trying to talk—"
"Gal, leave the room. Now."
Her expression crumpled. "You're just like everyone else. You think you're better than me—"
"I don't think that—"
"You do. You all do."
She turned and stormed out. The door slammed behind her. Jay stood frozen, his heart pounding. That had been bad.
He took a long moment to collect himself, then gathered the files and headed back.
When he reached his desk, the atmosphere was wrong. People were clustered in small groups, whispering. Rin looked stricken. Zoe was on her phone, her expression grim.
Ian emerged from his office.
“Jay. I need you to come with me. Conference room.”
Jay's blood turned to ice. "What happened?"
“I promise everything will be all right. But I need you to come with me now.”
Jay followed him. Inside were two people—an older, stern woman from HR and a man with a security badge he didn't recognise.
"This is Ms. Miller from HR and Mr. Oakford from security. Ms. Gray has filed a complaint."
Jay's legs nearly gave out. "What kind of complaint?"
"She's claiming you assaulted her in the archive room."
The world tilted. "What? No. I didn't—she came in while I was working and got too close and I told her to leave—"
"Please sit down," Ian said.
Jay sat. His hands were shaking.
Ms. Miller opened a tablet. "Mr. Hall, I need you to describe exactly what happened. Every detail."
Jay recounted the entire interaction. His voice was level but his mind was screaming. This couldn't be happening.
"The archive room has surveillance cameras. We're reviewing the footage now."
"Cameras?" Jay repeated.
"Every room in this building has them."
Ten minutes later, Mr. Oakford returned with his tablet. He placed it on the table and pressed play.
The footage showed everything. Jay reaching for files. Gal entering. The conversation, audio included. Her moving closer despite his clear discomfort. Him asking her to leave. Her storming out. At no point did Jay touch her.
Ms. Miller's expression was glacial. "Where is Ms. Gray now?"
"Still in the building. Waiting in Conference Room D."
"Bring her here."
Five minutes later, Gal entered. She saw the tablet and went pale.
"Ms. Gray. You filed a false report claiming Mr. Hall assaulted you. The surveillance footage shows this is completely untrue."
"I—he—"
"You have ten minutes to collect your belongings. Security will escort you out. Your termination is effective immediately. Our legal team will be in contact regarding this incident."
Gal's face went white, then red. "You can't—"
"We can and we are. Mr. Oakford, please escort her."
Security took her out. She didn't look at Jay.
Ms. Miller turned to him. "Mr. Hall, I apologize for putting you through this. The complaint has been dismissed and removed from any records. If you need time off or would like to speak with a counselor, those resources are available."
"Thank you," Jay said automatically.
"Mr. Hagen, if you have nothing to add, I'll file my report."
"I have nothing to add. Thank you for your swift response."
Ms. Miller left. The conference room fell silent. Jay stared at the table. His hands were still shaking.
"Jay."
He looked up. Ian's expression was calm, but his eyes were furious.
"Are you alright?"
"Yes."
"You don't look alright."
"I'm fine. It's resolved."
"That doesn't mean you're fine."
Jay's throat was tight. "I will be."
"I'm taking you home."
"That's not necessary—"
"Yes, it is. Get your things."
Jay didn't have the strength to argue. He collected his bag from his desk, ignoring the concerned looks from his colleagues. 
Ian drove in silence. When they reached Jay's building, he parked and turned off the engine.
"Do you want me to come up?"
"No. Thank you. I just need to rest."
"Call me if you need anything."
"I will."
Jay went inside. He dropped his bag by the door and sat on the couch, staring at nothing.
It was resolved. Gal was gone. The legal team would handle the rest. But his hands wouldn't stop shaking.
He'd recommended her for the position. He'd been the one to tell Ian she was promising. And she'd tried to destroy him.
His phone rang at seven. It was Leo.
"I'm outside. Let me in."
"I'm fine—"
"Let me in."
"You’re the last person I want to see right now."
"No one in this company has as much experience with failed hires as I do, so I figured I’m the best man to share the current pain with."
Jay sighed and buzzed him up. Leo arrived with a bag of takeout  and a determined expression.
"You're eating dinner," Leo announced.
"I'm not hungry."
"You're eating anyway."
He unpacked containers of food and set them on the table. 
"Ian told me what happened," Leo said.
"It's resolved."
"That doesn't make it less awful."
Jay said nothing.
Leo sat back. "This isn't the first time something like this has happened at the company. We've had similar incidents over the years. One was particularly bad. Do you want to hear about it?"
"Why would I want to hear about it?"
"Because sometimes it helps to know you're not alone."
"Fine."
Leo told him about a junior analyst who'd falsified reports, blamed a senior colleague, and tried to blackmail their way into a promotion. About a secretary who'd stolen proprietary information and claimed harassment when caught. About an intern who'd vandalized equipment and accused a manager of creating a hostile work environment.
"People do terrible things when they're desperate or entitled or both. It's not your fault for not seeing it coming."
"I recommended her."
"You recommended someone who interviewed well and seemed competent. How were you supposed to know she'd turn out like this?"
"I should have—"
"Jay. Stop."
Jay looked at him.
"Something similar happened to Ian. Years ago, when he was newer to the company. A coworker accused him of inappropriate conduct."
Jay went still. "What?"
"We didn't have as many cameras back then. It turned into a nasty legal battle. Took months to resolve."
"What happened?"
"Eventually we found enough evidence to disprove the claims. But it was brutal. Depositions, interviews, the whole thing dragged through the mud."
"How did Ian handle it?"
"He was stoic. Unruffled, at least on the surface. But this was shortly after his scandal. I think he just expected people to be scum. Like it was confirmation of what he already believed about the world."
"That's horrible."
"It is. But it's also why we installed cameras everywhere after that. Why we have strict protocols. So this kind of thing gets shut down immediately instead of dragging on."
"So I got lucky."
"You got protected by systems we built specifically to protect people."
"Is Ian alright? This must have brought back bad memories."
"He's more concerned about you than himself."
Jay picked at his food. His appetite was still gone, but he forced himself to eat.
Leo stayed for another hour, telling ridiculous stories about past company disasters until Jay almost smiled despite everything.
"Thank you. For coming over."
"Anytime. And Jay? Take tomorrow off. Don't argue."
When Leo finally left, Jay felt marginally better.
He did take Friday off. He spent the day in his apartment, alternating between restless pacing and sitting motionless on the couch.
His mind kept returning to the same thoughts in circles.
He'd recommended Gal, and she'd tried to ruin him. What did that say about his judgment? 
By Saturday, the spiraling thoughts had calmed down.
This was just another ordeal to endure if he wanted to stay where he was. And he did want to stay.
He wanted to stay by Ian's side. More than he wanted safety or certainty or freedom from complications. No matter how difficult it became. No matter what he had to endure.
That resolve gave him strength.
Scene 5
Even if it hurts
Jay went to the gym on Saturday morning. Rus was there, as always, cheerful and loud.
"How was the rest of your birthday weekend?"
"Fine."
"Your family get home safe?"
"Yeah."
"You alright?"
"Just tired. Long week."
It wasn't exactly a lie. The situation with Gal felt too raw to discuss, too complicated to explain, too close to things he'd spent years trying to forget. Rus seemed to sense this and didn't push. They worked out, then parted ways with plans to meet again next week.
Jay spent the rest of the weekend at home. Cleaning. Reading. Sitting on the balcony and watching the river. Preparing himself mentally for Monday. Monday morning was warm and sunny. Jay dressed in his best office suit. He needed the armour today.
He arrived at his desk and started working. Everything felt normal on the surface. Inside, he was a mess. His facade was paper thin. At ten, Zoe stopped by his desk.
"For what it's worth, everyone knows what actually happened. You're not under suspicion."
"That's good."
"And we've all dealt with problem hires before. It's not your fault."
Jay nodded. Zoe squeezed his shoulder and left.
At lunch, Max sat down across from him.
"When I was your age, I recommended someone for a position. They lasted three weeks before getting caught stealing equipment. I felt terrible about it for months."
"What did you do?"
"Eventually accepted that I'd made the best decision I could with the information I had. That's all anyone can do."
Their support helped. But it didn't erase the underlying guilt or the uncomfortable feeling that Jay had caused this entire situation.
Ian sat in his office and watched Jay through the glass wall.
Jay was working. Typing, reviewing documents, responding to messages. But his shoulders were tense, like he was holding himself together through sheer willpower.
Ian felt fury at himself. He should have fired Gal immediately after the quarterly party incident. He'd delayed, wanting to minimize disruption, wanting to avoid making Jay feel guilty before his family's visit. And that delay had resulted in this.
Jay had been cornered. Subjected to an HR investigation. All because Ian had made a calculated decision to wait.
The cameras had resolved it quickly, but the damage was done. Jay had experienced that moment of terror, that feeling of being falsely accused with no way to defend himself. Ian knew that feeling intimately. It left scars. He'd caused this. His choice. His failure to act decisively.
Ian stood and walked to Jay's desk. Jay looked up.
"Do you have a moment?"
"Of course."
They went to Ian's office. Ian closed the door and gestured to the chair. Jay sat.
"I wanted to check in. Make sure you're managing alright."
"I'm fine."
"Jay."
"Really. It's resolved. Everyone's been supportive. I'm handling it."
Jay's smile was brittle. Everything about him screamed that he was not fine, but Ian didn't want to push. He didn't want to make it worse by forcing a conversation Jay clearly wasn't ready for.
"If you need anything. Time off, adjusted responsibilities, anything at all. Tell me."
"I will. Thank you."
"I mean it."
"I know."
They returned to work, but Ian couldn't stop worrying.
Tuesday was worse. Jay's facade was crumbling. He stared at his screen without typing. Wednesday was the same. Ian couldn't stand it anymore.
He waited until the end of the workday. He watched Jay leave the office and gave him thirty minutes to get home, then he followed.
He knew it was crossing a line. Showing up uninvited at Jay's apartment was not something a boss did for an employee. But he couldn't just stand by and watch Jay spiral.
Jay opened the door looking surprised. 
"Ian. Is something wrong?"
"Can I come in?"
"Of course."
Ian stepped inside. The apartment was tidy, as always.
"I was worried," Ian said.
"I'm fine."
"You're not."
"I will be."
"Jay. Please. Talk to me."
They sat on the couch. Jay pulled his knees up, wrapping his arms around them.
Ian was terrified that Jay was thinking about leaving again. That this incident had been the final straw. That Ian was about to lose him.
"I keep thinking about how I recommended her. How I thought she'd be good for the team."
"You couldn't have known."
"But I should have seen something."
"There was nothing to see. She interviewed well. She performed adequately for weeks. Then she made terrible choices. That's not your failure."
Jay didn't respond. He looked small and miserable. Ian wanted to take away Jay's pain, to make everything better.
"When Leo first started hiring assistants for me, most of them were disasters. One tried to seduce me within the first week. Another stole files and sold them to a competitor. Another spread rumors that I was having affairs with half the executive team."
Jay looked up. "Really?"
"Really. Leo thought it was hilarious. I thought it was a nightmare. But it taught me something. People are complicated. Sometimes they interview well and perform terribly. Sometimes they seem harmless and turn out to be dangerous. You can't predict it. You can only respond when it becomes clear."
"I thought Gal was just awkward."
"So did I. That's why I didn't act sooner. I underestimated the danger because she seemed so uncertain and unthreatening. That was my mistake, not yours. I'm sorry this happened to you. I'm sorry I didn't prevent it."
"It's not your fault."
"It is. I should have removed her immediately after the party incident. I chose to wait and that choice led to this."
"You were trying to be fair."
"I was trying to avoid disruption. And in doing so, I created worse disruption."
Ian wanted to understand what Jay was thinking. He wanted to ask if he was planning to leave. 
Instead he said, "It will get better. The gossip will fade. The memory will become just another unpleasant incident that happened and was resolved."
Jay's eyes were bright with unshed tears. "Thank you."
Ian stood to leave. He'd crossed a line by coming here uninvited, but he couldn't regret it. Not when Jay looked like he was drowning.
At the door, Ian turned back. Jay was looking so profoundly sad that Ian couldn't stop himself. He closed the distance and pulled Jay into a hug.
Jay went still for a heartbeat. Then he clung back desperately, his arms wrapping tight around Ian's waist, his face pressed against Ian's shoulder.
Ian held him like something precious and fragile. Jay's breathing was uneven. They stood like that for a long time, neither speaking, just holding on. When they finally separated, Jay's cheeks were flushed.
"Do you remember, back in the winter, we planned that outing, but it got cancelled because of the client meeting," Jay asked.
"I remember."
"Can we still do that? Someday?"
"Yes. Whenever you want."
Jay nodded. He looked like he wanted to say something else but couldn't find the words.
Ian wanted to stay. He wanted to pull Jay back into his arms and never let go. But he also knew that would be risking too much.
"I'll see you tomorrow," Ian said.
"Tomorrow."
Ian left. The door closed behind him. He stood in the hallway, leaning against the wall beside Jay's door. Inside, Jay leaned against the same wall. Both of them separated by mere centimetres. Both longing for the other. Both battling that longing.
Ian was terrified. Jay's request had sounded desperate, like a farewell, like someone trying to capture one last good memory before leaving. Ian couldn't bear the thought of losing him. He would fight for this. Make things better. Make sure Jay wanted to stay.
Jay was simply tired. Tired of wanting something he believed he could never have. But also determined to stay. To collect these sweet moments, these brief touches. Even if it hurt. Even if it was hopeless.
Jay slid down the wall and sat on the floor. The warmth of that embrace still lingered on his skin. He wanted more. He wanted everything.
But he would take what he could have. And he would be grateful for it.
