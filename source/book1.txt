Clouds Over Gethsemane

The Arrangement
Chapter 1: Things set in motion
Scene 1
The gift
The thirty-second floor of the Northlight Financial Center housed Turner & Associates, where  windows offered an unobstructed view of the city's financial district. Ian Hagen sat behind his  desk, reviewing reports with the attention that had earned him his reputation. Numbers never lied, never schemed, never betrayed trust for personal gain.
"Ian. Perfect timing." Leo Turner interrupted his concentration. 
Ian looked up to find his friend standing in the doorway, wearing an expression that Ian had learned to distrust over the years.
"What have you done now?"
Leo stepped into the office and closed the door behind him. "I've found you an assistant. Again."
"I don't need an assistant."
"You said that about the last three."
"The last three were your poorly disguised attempts at matchmaking. Though I admit Luc turned out surprisingly competent."
"Jay Hall has a decent economics degree from some local university, worked for three years at a forgettable mid-tier firm. His qualifications are thoroughly unremarkable, but he's got gray eyes, pale skin, and looks like he'd apologize for breathing too loudly. Exactly your type."
"You're never going to stop punishing me for the Connelly incident, are you?"
"This isn't punishment. This is therapy. You work sixteen-hour days, handle correspondence that should be delegated, and haven't had a proper conversation with an attractive man in months. Jay Hall could be good for you."
"Or he could be another corporate spy looking to pilfer our client list."
"Ian. That was thirteen years ago. Sam Connelly was a hired operative. The chances of lightning striking twice—"
"Are higher than you think in our line of work." Ian got up and walked to the window. The city sprawled beneath them, filled with ambitious people willing to exploit any advantage. "You know what the tabloids called me after that story broke? The billionaire's lovesick son. My own father couldn't look at me."
"Your father is an ass who cares more about appearances than his son's well-being."
"He wasn't wrong to be furious. I handed over strategic information to a competitor because I was infatuated with a beautiful man. I cost the family company millions in lost deals."
"You fell in love with someone who turned out to be lying about who he was. The fact that Sam walked away when he did, that he never used most of what he learned, that he tried to minimize the damage—"
"Doesn't change the fact that I was completely blind to what was happening."
"You were twenty-five years old and in love. Of course you were blind. But you weren't stupid, Ian. Sam Connelly was a spy. He was trained to be charming, to find vulnerabilities, to make people trust him. You had no reason to suspect—"
"I had every reason to be more careful."
"Oh absolutely, you should have been paranoid about every attractive man who crossed your path. Really, what were you thinking, trusting someone? Look where that reckless optimism got you—fired from the family company, disowned by your father, splashed across every tabloid in the city, financially ruined, and blacklisted in your field. Lucky for you, you had a friend willing to fight his own father to give you a second chance."
"Your father made his feelings about that decision very clear for the first year."
"My father is also the one who doubled your salary after you saved the deal with Anderson. And again after you restructured Merrick Investments. And again last quarter when you—"
"I understand your point."
"Do you? Because sometimes I think you still see yourself as that naive twenty-five-year-old who got taken in by a pretty face. You're not that person anymore, Ian. You're one of the most successful financial minds in the city. You've earned the right to trust your own judgment."
Ian already felt the weight of resignation. Leo had saved him once, completely and without question. The least he could do was humor his friend's schemes, however misguided they might be. 
"When does he start?"
"Monday morning. Nine o'clock sharp."
"And if this turns into another disaster?"
"Then I'll be there to pick you up and dust you off again, just like I did thirteen years ago. Though I have a feeling the only disaster will be you discovering that sometimes a boring accountant is just a boring accountant."
Ian already knew he would regret this decision. "Monday morning. Nine o'clock sharp."
"Thank you. Jay Hall is a good man who needs a job. You're a good man who needs help. I'm hoping you'll both benefit from the arrangement." 
"You're enjoying this."
"I'm hoping for this. Sam Connelly broke your heart, but he also gave you the best eight months of your life. You told me so yourself."
"Before I knew what he was."
"He was a man doing a job he probably hated, who fell for someone he was supposed to betray. The fact that he walked away instead of following through with his assignment speaks volumes about his character."
After Leo left, Ian returned to his reports, but the numbers seemed to blur together on the page. The conversation had stirred up memories he preferred to keep buried—not just of Sam Connelly's betrayal, but of the tender mornings they had shared, the warmth that had seemed so real at the time.
The scandal had been devastating. "Billionaire Heir's Love Nest Exposed" had been splashed across tabloids for weeks, complete with photos of Ian and Sam leaving restaurants, attending theater performances, living what Ian had thought was a private life. His father's fury had been absolute, not just at the security breach, but at Ian's public humiliation of the family name.
The firing had been swift, the disownment even swifter. Ian became suddenly unemployed, publicly shamed, and effectively homeless within a matter of days. Leo's intervention had been his salvation, though even that had come at a cost. The elder Turner had made his displeasure clear, questioning Leo's judgment in hiring a liability and making Ian's first year at the firm a careful dance of proving his worth while avoiding any hint of impropriety.
But Ian had proven himself, quarter after quarter of exceptional results. He had earned his place here through competence and dedication, building walls around himself that no Sam Connelly could breach again.
Now Leo wanted to test those walls again.
Ian pushed away thoughts of Monday morning and the man who would soon occupy the desk outside his office. The numbers on the page demanded his attention, and numbers, at least, were something he could trust.
Scene 2
Arrival
The following Monday morning, Jay Hall arrived at the gleaming chrome-and-glass entrance of Northlight Financial Center a full twenty minutes early. He’d picked out his suit days ago, the best one he owned, a sober grey that still felt a little stiff. Even though it was already in perfect condition, he still spent half an hour inspecting every detail, and another fifteen minutes trying to force his black hair into something resembling style. He clutched his satchel, his heart thumping a nervous but excited rhythm against his ribs. This was it. A real chance.
He announced himself to the receptionist, a poised woman who gave him a polite, appraising smile before directing him to a comfortable waiting area. Jay sat on the edge of an expensive leather armchair, trying not to look as awestruck as he felt by the opulence of the lobby.
A few minutes later, a door opened and Leo Turner emerged, as confident and easy-going as ever. He was dressed impeccably, but with more flair than the others in the office—a patterned shirt, no tie, and a smile that managed to be both welcoming and shrewd. 
"Jay Hall! Right on time. No, a bit early, even better! Enthusiasm, I like it." Leo extended a hand, offering a firm handshake. "Welcome to the company."
Jay scrambled to his feet, nearly dropping his satchel. "Mr. Turner, thank you. It's an honour to be here. Really." His voice was a little breathier than he intended, but his smile was sincere. He hoped he wasn't coming across as too desperate, but frankly, he was desperate—for a good, stable, uncomplicated job.
"Please, call me Leo. We're not overly formal here… well, some of us aren't." Leo winked, a quick, conspiratorial gesture that Jay didn't quite know how to interpret, so he just nodded. "Come on, let me show you around the immediate vicinity, get you set up."
Leo led him through a section of the open-plan office. It was already buzzing with activity, people focused on screens, murmuring into headsets. Everyone looked sharp and driven. Jay felt a fresh wave of intimidation, but also a thrill.
"Your primary role, as we discussed, will be supporting Ian Hagen, our CFO," Leo said, his voice dropping slightly as they approached a more secluded corridor lined with offices that had actual doors. "He's… well, he’s Ian. Brilliant, demanding, expects the best. But I have a good feeling about this. A very good feeling." Leo gave Jay a pointed look.
Jay's heart gave a little leap at the mention of Ian. Demanding, expects the best. That sounded like someone who wouldn't have time for nonsense. 
"I've heard he's an exceptional manager, sir— Leo," Jay corrected himself quickly, flushing a little. "I'm really looking forward to learning from him. I'll do my absolute best not to disappoint." The earnestness in his voice was palpable. He truly meant it. This was his sanctuary.
"Oh, I don't think disappoint will be the word, Jay. Not at all." Leo stopped outside a closed door. "This will be Ian’s den. He’s in a meeting right now, but you’ll meet him later. Your workstation is just here." He indicated a neat, well-equipped desk in a small alcove just outside Ian's office, shared with one other, currently empty, assistant's desk. "You'll be handling a lot of his reports, due diligence groundwork, keeping his schedule from imploding, the fun stuff. Back-office heroics, basically."
"It sounds great," Jay breathed, his eyes shining as he took in the desk, the powerful computer, the view of the city skyline from a nearby window. The salary was more than he’d ever earned, the company was prestigious, and his boss was famously, wonderfully cynical about workplace flirtations. He couldn't have engineered a better situation if he’d tried.
"Glad you think so," Leo said, his eyes crinkling at the corners with amusement. He clapped Jay on the shoulder. "Alright, HR will be by in a bit with the mountain of paperwork. Get comfortable, get your logins. And Jay?"
"Yes?"
"Just be yourself. I have a feeling that's exactly what Ian needs." Leo's smile was positively beaming now, like a cat that had not only gotten the cream but had also figured out how to open the entire dairy.
Jay nodded fervently, completely missing the undercurrent. "I will. Thank you again, Leo. For everything."
Leo gave a final, cheerful wave and headed back towards his own office. Oh, this was going to be fun. Young, pretty, and so transparently eager. Ian wouldn't know what hit him.
As Leo left, Jay sank into his new ergonomic chair, a wave of profound relief washing over him, so potent it almost made him dizzy. His last job, at a mid-tier consulting firm, had been… adequate. The work itself was fine, even a little challenging at times, but then a senior analyst with clammy hands and a predatory gleam in his eye had started finding excuses to mentor him a little too closely. The lingering touches, the private chats that veered into uncomfortable territory, it had all escalated with terrifying speed, forcing Jay into a frantic job search. He'd almost exclusively targeted companies with strong HR reputations, but then he'd stumbled upon a rather gossipy thread on-line mentioning Ian Hagen. The man was a legend, not just for his financial acumen, but for being openly, unapologetically gay, and, crucially, for the almost mythical stories of his icy dismissal of anyone who dared try to use their charms to get ahead with him. Apparently, some past drama had made him utterly immune, even hostile, to such advances. It sounded like a fortress. 
Jay had sent in his application to Turner & Associates on a wing and a prayer, never imagining he’d even get a call back for such a prestigious firm, let alone an interview with the owner’s son. When the job offer came, it felt like winning the lottery. He was going to pour every ounce of his being into this role, be the most diligent and unobtrusive assistant Ian Hagen had ever seen. He would make himself indispensable, and invisible in any way that wasn't purely about the work.
Scene 3
Introduction
The desk outside Ian's office had been empty for almost a year, serving mainly as a repository for files that needed his attention. Now it held a young man with the features Leo had described and an air of concentration as he worked through employment forms.
Ian paused in his office doorway, observing. Jay Hall looked younger than his twenty-nine years, dressed in a plain suit that gave the impression of attention to appropriateness. His posture spoke of effort—a man trying hard to make a good impression, shoulders straight but tense, pen gripped as if determined not to make mistakes.
Everything about the scene felt calculated to appeal to Ian's protective instincts. It was exactly what someone might do if they wanted to present themselves as harmless, eager, in need of guidance.
Ian stepped out of his office.
Jay looked up immediately, and Ian caught the brief moment of assessment in those large gray eyes before the younger man scrambled to his feet. The movement was awkward, his hip bumping against the desk edge, papers scattering slightly.
"Mr. Hagen. I'm Jay Hall. Thank you so much for this opportunity. I've reviewed the preliminary materials Leo provided, and I'm eager to contribute to the team's success."
The words came out as if Jay had rehearsed them multiple times. Which he probably had. 
"Welcome to Turner & Associates. I trust HR has provided everything you need for the initial paperwork?"
"Yes, sir. Almost finished." Jay gestured toward the forms, then seemed to realize the gesture was unnecessary and let his hand drop. "I arrived early to make sure everything was in order."
Of course he had. Ian wondered if that eagerness was authentic or another constructed element of Jay's appeal. Sam Connelly had been punctual too, always arriving before Ian, staying late to ensure projects were completed perfectly.
"I'll introduce you to the rest of the department." Ian moved toward the open workspace visible through the glass partition. "Your primary responsibilities will involve managing my calendar, handling correspondence, and providing analytical support for client reports."
Jay followed, and Ian was acutely aware of the younger man behind him, not presumptuous or invasive, but clearly attentive.
The main floor housed twelve desks arranged to promote both collaboration and focus, but only half were occupied, their inhabitants already deep in the day's work. The others sat empty, with dark monitors and pushed in chairs. 
"Amy Evans, our senior analyst." Ian stopped beside a dark haired woman in her forties who looked up with a welcoming smile. "Amy, this is Jay Hall, my new assistant."
"Finally." Amy stood to shake Jay's hand. "Ian's been drowning in administrative work for months. Welcome aboard."
"Thank you. I look forward to working with everyone."
They moved through the introductions. "Luc Webb, our junior associate," Ian moved to a handsome man with neat black hair who looked up with a cheerful smile. "Luc started as my assistant two years ago and worked his way up fast." Luc's greeting was confident as he shook hands.
"Ela Rodriguez handles our international accounts." Ian gestured to an impeccably dressed woman whose tailored jacket made her look like she'd stepped straight from a boardroom. Her handshake was firm, her smile amiable.
"Zoe Jones manages our portfolio risk assessments," Ian continued, approaching a petite blonde woman who glanced up briefly from her screen. Her "Nice to meet you" was accompanied by a shy smile before she turned her attention back to her work.
"And Kim Thompson, our technology specialist." The last introduction was to a man in jeans and a sweater, the relaxed attire standing out among the more formally dressed team. Kim's grin was unpretentious as he waved from his desk.
Each greeting was proper and friendly. And that, Ian realized, was what bothered him most. Jay's responses were appropriate and completely normal. There was nothing that raised obvious red flags. Just a quiet young man who seemed interested in the work.
It was exactly what someone would do if they were very good at deception.
"Questions so far?" Ian asked as they returned to Jay's desk.
"Nothing immediate. The department structure is clear, and everyone seems very capable." Jay hesitated, then added, "I know my qualifications aren't exceptional, Mr. Hagen. I want you to know I'm committed to exceeding your expectations."
The admission was delivered without self-pity or false modesty, just a straightforward acknowledgement of reality. Ian was moved by the honesty, then immediately suspicious of that reaction. Sam had been honest too, in his way. Honest about his background, his education. It was only his identity and motivations that had been lies.
"Competence matters more than credentials," Ian said, which was true enough. "I'll expect your best effort, nothing more or less."
"You'll have it."
Ian returned to his office, leaving Jay to finish his paperwork. Through his glass door, he could observe the younger man's movements. When Jay reached for his phone to answer what was likely his first call, his posture straightened and his voice was clear enough for Ian to hear the greeting.
Everything about Jay Hall appeared authentic. Which was exactly what made Ian most suspicious.
For his part, Jay felt as if he had stumbled into a dream. The office was everything he had imagined when Leo Turner had called with the offer—sleek, sophisticated, populated by people who clearly took their work seriously. And Ian Hagen was exactly what Jay had hoped for in a superior. Formal without being dismissive or condescending. The way Ian handled introductions made it clear he cared about his staff’s integration and didn't simply dump new hires into the workplace without support.
Jay had been prepared for arrogance, for casual cruelty that successful men sometimes displayed toward those they perceived as beneath them. Instead, Ian had treated him with courtesy, explaining duties without talking down to him, introducing him as a colleague and not simply "the help."
There was no denying the man’s magnetism. Tall, blonde and impeccably dressed, with refined features that belonged in boardrooms and exclusive restaurants. But there was something else, a quality Jay couldn't quite identify. A watchfulness, as if he was always assessing the room.
Whatever it was, it made Jay more determined to prove himself worthy of this opportunity. He had been honest about his modest qualifications, but he hadn't mentioned his hunger for something better than the dead-end position he had left behind, or his excitement at the chance to work somewhere that mattered.
This was his opportunity to build something meaningful, to work alongside people who were truly accomplished. He wouldn't waste it.
As he completed the final form and reached for his phone to handle his first official call, Jay caught sight of Ian through the glass office door. The older man was reviewing documents with the same attention Jay had observed during their brief interaction. 
This was going to work out perfectly.
Jay spent the rest of his first day drowning in manuals, company policies and client protocols. Ian had provided him with a stack of materials thick enough to serve as a doorstop and a brief explanation of procedures before disappearing back into his office. Not long after, Kim appeared with his new equipment: a laptop, tablet and phone so high-end and pristine they belonged in a different league from anything he’d owned before, all already set up and ready to use, along with login credentials for various systems.
The work itself was straightforward enough. What overwhelmed Jay was everything else. The office building's amenities read like an exclusive hotel brochure. The kitchen and lounge area near their department featured a gleaming espresso machine that looked unnecessarily complex, a refrigerator stocked with organic beverages he'd only seen in upscale grocery stores, and an endless supply of artisanal snacks arranged in glass containers.
Jay had grown up in a town where the fanciest coffee came from a gas station, where office break rooms meant a table with a coffee pot if you were lucky. The idea of unlimited premium refreshments available to employees seemed almost wasteful, though he was careful not to take more than seemed appropriate.
He was hyper-aware of his clothing and his speech patterns. Everyone else moved through the space with confidence, helping themselves to imported sparkling water and gourmet cookies as if such sumptuousness was perfectly ordinary.
In the afternoon Jay kept browsing endless orientation materials and system tutorials. He absorbed everything, taking notes in his neat handwriting. When five o'clock arrived, he was still deep in documentation, barely aware of the time.
"Jay. Time to go home,"  Ian said from his office doorway. 
Jay looked up, startled. "I'm still working through the materials. I can stay—"
"No. I don't encourage overtime for administrative tasks. Leave the enthusiasm to them." Ian gestured toward the main workspace, where several associates were still hunched over their computers. "Regular hours, consistent performance."
Jay gathered his belongings, feeling mildly dismissed but appreciating the clear communication. The ride home on public transit gave him time to process the day, and it wasn't until he was unlocking his apartment door that he realized he'd been too excited to eat lunch.
His stomach growled as he dropped his bag by the door, but Jay first removed his suit jacket and hung it properly in the closet, then changed his  shirt and trousers for loose sweatpants and an old t-shirt. Only then did he head for the kitchen. He pulled out the sandwich he'd packed that morning and unwrapped it while reheating leftovers from the night before. The combination was hardly gourmet, but he was too hungry to care.
As he ate, Jay's mind kept returning to Ian Hagen. He was so handsome that it seemed almost unfair—like he had stepped out of a period drama where everyone spoke in perfect sentences and walked with innate grace. His posture was flawless, his manner of speaking inspiring. Even his hands were remarkable, appearing simultaneously strong and elegant. Jay had never met anyone who seemed so perfectly put together in every conceivable way. 
The office itself had been impressive enough—the sweeping views, the expensive furniture, the sense of operating at the highest levels of finance. But Ian elevated it all. Jay could imagine learning enormous amounts just by observing how he conducted meetings, how he analyzed problems, how he made decisions.
This was exactly the opportunity Jay had dreamed of when he moved to the city. A chance to work alongside someone truly exceptional. The thought filled him with renewed determination.
After finishing his makeshift dinner, Jay spread the orientation materials across his small dining table. He read through employee handbooks, organizational charts, and client overview documents until the sun had set completely. Every detail mattered. He wanted to arrive tomorrow armed with knowledge.
By nine o'clock, his eyes were starting to strain. Jay closed the folders and headed for the shower, letting the hot water wash away the day's nervousness. 
Afterwards he laid out his suit and inspected every detail. A small thread hung loose from one button, which he trimmed with scissors. He picked a fresh shirt that looked crisp enough, but he ran the iron over the collar anyway, making sure the points lay perfectly flat. His tie received the same treatment, draped over the closet door.
First impressions mattered, but second impressions mattered too. 
By eleven, Jay was in bed with his alarm set for six-thirty. Plenty of time to arrive early and establish himself as reliable.
Scene 4
Settling in
The next morning, Jay arrived at eight o'clock to find Ian already at his desk, coffee in hand, reviewing overnight market reports. Jay hesitated outside his own workspace, uncertain whether he should interrupt. The older man looked completely absorbed in his work, and Jay had no idea what the appropriate protocol might be for morning greetings.
He sat behind his desk and tried to look busy organizing papers that were already perfectly organized. Ten minutes later, Ian emerged from his office with a stack of files.
"Good morning, Mr. Hagen." Jay stood immediately, perhaps too quickly.
"Ian." The correction was mild but definite. "Everyone here uses first names. We're colleagues, not a nineteenth-century law firm."
"Ian." Jay tested the name, as if it might break. "Good morning."
"Good morning. These are client profiles for this week's meetings. I'll need summaries of their current portfolio positions by Thursday." Ian handed over the files.
"Of course. Is there a particular format you prefer?"
"The templates are in the shared folder. Ask Luc if you have questions about the system."
After Ian returned to his office, Jay made his way to the kitchen area, hoping to figure out the espresso machine without embarrassing himself. The device looked like it belonged on a spaceship.
"First time with the beast?" Luc appeared beside him, coffee mug in hand. He was perhaps a few years older than Jay, with a friendly smile and a relaxed demeanour.
"Is it that obvious?"
"You're staring at it like it might bite." Luc reached past him to access the machine's controls. "Here, watch. Grind setting depends on what you want. This button for milk steaming if you're feeling fancy."
Jay watched as Luc demonstrated each step, expecting an impatient instruction he'd received at previous jobs when asking for help. Instead, Luc took care to explain each function, even showing Jay where the cleaning supplies were kept.
"Thanks. I appreciate the patience."
"No problem. We've all been the new person." Luc prepared his own coffee with ease. "Fair warning—Ian's particular about his coffee. Single origin, no sugar, no milk. He's got his own supply in his office, but if you ever need to make him one, the good beans are in the sealed container on the top shelf."
Jay filed away this information along with everything else he was learning about his new workplace. The coffee he eventually produced was better than anything he'd ever made for himself, rich and complex, justifying the expensive equipment.
Back at his desk with his perfect coffee and the stack of client files, Jay felt a surge of contentment. This was exactly what he'd hoped for—meaningful work, capable colleagues, an environment where competence was valued and supported. He opened the first file and began reading, determined to prove himself worthy of the opportunity.
From his office, Ian observed Jay's  movements, the way the younger man handled the client files with reverence, the attention he gave to each document. The enthusiasm was unmistakable. Jay approached even simple tasks as if they were important work.
It was exactly the behaviour that had charmed Ian thirteen years ago. Sam Connelly had shown the same eagerness, the same gratitude for opportunities. The way Jay had looked at him that morning—like Christmas had arrived early—was particularly unsettling. That combination of respect and personal interest that could as well be innocent or entirely calculated.
Ian returned to his market reports, pushing away the comparison. Jay Hall was not Sam Connelly, and Ian was not the naive twenty-five-year-old who had fallen for a beautiful face and a hard luck story. He was a successful executive with the wisdom to keep himself safe while giving new employees fair opportunities to establish themselves.
Whether Jay's enthusiasm was real or performed would become clear soon enough. Until then, Ian would remain perfectly amiable. And completely guarded.
The next day, Jay arrived at the office twenty minutes early. The elevator ride felt less intimidating than Monday's first ascent, though his stomach still fluttered when the doors opened to reveal Turner & Associates' marble lobby.
The receptionist offered him a friendly smile as he passed, and Jay said a quiet "Good morning" in return. His desk appeared exactly as he'd left it on Tuesday—organized and equipped with the sleek laptop that still felt too expensive for his hands.
Ian's office door were closed, but Jay could see the faint glow of his computer screen through the  glass. According to the calendar, Ian had an early morning call with overseas investors, which meant Jay had time to review his client summaries one final time before the morning rush began.
He opened the three files he'd been studying religiously since yesterday. Each summary represented hours of research, both at the office and at home the previous evening, where he'd spent additional time reading client details and learning about their industries. Jay had written and rewritten each summary twice, using the templates Ian had provided and matching the formal tone he'd observed in similar documents.
"Morning, Jay. How's the crash course going?" Luc dropped into the chair beside his desk.
"I think I'm managing. Still learning everyone's preferred formats," Jay replied, closing the file.
"Ian's particular about structure, but he's fair. If you put in the effort, he'll recognize it. He's been buried in the Tokyo deal since six this morning. Don't worry, he doesn't expect you to match those hours. Ian just does that sometimes for international calls," Luc said, glancing toward the closed office door.
Jay nodded. He'd memorized Ian's morning schedule, with the back-to-back calls that would keep him occupied until well past noon. The afternoon held two internal meetings, leaving little time for Jay to present his completed summaries.
Kim Thompson materialized at Jay's desk with a stack of papers. "Morning entertainment," he announced, setting down expense reports. "Ian needs these digitized and categorized by Friday. Welcome to the glamorous world of high finance."
"Thanks," Jay said, accepting the task without complaint. The work looked tedious but straightforward, an assignment he could handle without fear of making costly mistakes.
"Don't look so thrilled," Kim said dryly. "At least it's not Leo's receipts."
Jay attempted a smile, still uncertain about the office's tolerance for humour. 
Jay drafted a schedule. Client summaries occupied his morning priority slot, expense reports filled after Ian's meetings and calendar maintenance happened after lunch. Leo Turner's arrival disrupted his plan.
"Jay, my friend." Leo appeared beside his desk, holding an elegant leather messenger bag. "I have a gift."
Jay looked up from his computer screen, automatically saving his work. "Mr. Turner—" He caught himself. "Leo. Good morning."
"Office equipment upgrade," Leo said, placing the bag on Jay's desk. "Standard issue for all our assistants."
The messenger bag was beautiful—supple brown leather with brass fittings, clearly expensive. Jay examined the craftsmanship, the multiple compartments and padding designed specifically for electronics. His current laptop bag, purchased during his university years, bore multiple patches and a broken zipper.
"Thank you. This will be very useful."
"Image matters in this business. Our clients expect a certain level of presentation."
Jay slipped his laptop into the new bag, testing how well it fit and marvelling that everything seemed to slot in perfectly. The construction was flawless, clearly built to last decades. The leather smelled rich and new, a marked contrast to the synthetic materials he was accustomed to using.
"I should let you get back to work. Ian mentioned you're handling some client summaries. Important first assignment."
"I'm planning to have them ready by tomorrow morning. Assuming I can find time to finalize the formatting."
"Take your time. Better to deliver quality than speed."
As Leo disappeared toward the elevators, Jay set the laptop back on his desk and glanced at the new leather bag beside it. The equipment here was another level entirely, and he could take the sleek laptop home if needed. For a moment, he just took in the setup, all of it feeling a little unreal. It formed a cohesive set,  all expensive, all representing standards he was still learning to accept.
His phone buzzed with a calendar reminder—Ian's call would end in fifteen minutes, followed by a brief window before the next meeting. Jay opened his client summaries, reviewing the final drafts one more time.
Twenty minutes later, the office door opened. Ian emerged, straightening his tie, and approached Jay's desk.
"Good morning, Jay. How are the summaries progressing?"
"Nearly complete," Jay replied, minimizing the document window. "I should have them ready for your review by this afternoon."
"Excellent. When you have a moment, I have another task." Ian placed a folder on Jay's desk. "These are draft documents for a new client proposal. I need them proofread for accuracy and consistency. Nothing urgent—Friday afternoon will be sufficient."
"Of course. I'll add it to my schedule."
"Thank you. How are you finding the pace here?"
"Manageable. I'm still learning the systems, but I think I'm adapting well."
Ian nodded once, a brief acknowledgement that seemed to conclude their interaction. He returned to his office, leaving Jay to contemplate the growing collection of responsibilities accumulating on his desk.
At two-thirty, just as Jay had allocated time to review his summaries one final time, Ian's phone rang with an unexpected call from a client. The conversation stretched past three o'clock, with Ian's door remaining firmly closed throughout. Jay watched his schedule dissolve as the afternoon meetings moved to next week. 
When Ian finally emerged, Jay realized the summary discussion would have to wait until Thursday. He was beginning to understand that his role would involve constant adaptation to changing priorities instead of the predictable patterns he preferred. The realization felt daunting, but he told himself that flexibility was simply another skill he would need to develop if he wanted to succeed at Turner & Associates.
Scene 5
Signals
By Friday afternoon, Jay had completed his first week at Turner & Associates with a great success. Ian had assigned him progressively more complex tasks throughout the week, chosen less for their urgency than for their value in getting Jay acquainted with the work and the standards expected. Each assignment came with clear instructions and constructive feedback when Jay returned the completed work. Ian's corrections were delivered without condescension, his suggestions practical and not critical. When Jay had initially misunderstood the format for meeting summaries, Ian had simply provided a better example and asked him to revise accordingly.
"This client prefers detailed risk assessments," Ian had explained Thursday morning, reviewing Jay's report. "They're conservative investors who want to understand every variable. This section needs expansion."
Jay had taken notes eagerly, appreciating guidance that treated him as capable of improvement. His previous job had involved a supervisor who seemed to take personal pleasure in highlighting mistakes, often in front of other employees. Ian’s approach was in a league far above anything he’d experienced before.
After a week of learning the ropes, Ian gave him access to his email and calendar, then sat down with him for a detailed briefing on how they should be managed. He handed Jay a printed set of general rules, guidelines for prioritizing messages, handling meeting requests, and flagging anything urgent. For now, Jay would simply observe how Ian managed these himself, but once he understood the requirements, overseeing Ian’s email and calendar would become one of his key responsibilities.
The work itself was more engaging than anything Jay had done before. Instead of processing invoices for an accounting firm that served local businesses, he was now supporting investment decisions that involved millions and international markets. Even the simplest tasks felt important when they contributed to something larger than himself.
What made the week perfect, however, was the complete absence of unwanted attention. Jay had spent his last weeks at his previous job avoiding his senior’s colleague advances. The relief of working with people who presented no obvious red flags was almost overwhelming.
Ian treated him exactly as Jay had always hoped to be treated in a workplace—with respect and zero personal interest. Their interactions were courteous but formal, focused entirely on work objectives. When Ian needed to review documents at Jay's desk, he maintained physical distance. When Jay had questions, Ian answered them without turning them into unnecessary conversation.
It was paradise. Jay knew his enthusiasm was probably obvious, but he couldn't bring himself to care.
Ian, observing Jay's barely concealed delight with every mundane task, felt his suspicions crystallize into near certainty. The younger man's performance was competent enough, but it was his obvious pleasure in their interactions that raised the alarm.
Jay's face lit up whenever Ian approached his desk. He absorbed feedback as if he was memorizing scripture. Most tellingly, he seemed to find excuses to extend their interactions, asking follow-up questions that weren't strictly necessary or offering observations about clients that went beyond his assigned research scope.
The behaviour was subtle enough to maintain plausible deniability, but Ian recognized the pattern. Sam Connelly had done exactly the same thing—positioning himself as eager to learn and appreciating any attention from his successful supervisor. The gradual escalation from mild interest to personal devotion had been so subtly orchestrated that Ian hadn't recognized it until far too late.
This time, Ian was prepared. He maintained cordial interactions but made his disinterest in personal connection abundantly clear. Jay Hall would find no encouragement whatsoever if he hoped for anything at all.
The rest of the department, meanwhile, had reached their own conclusions about the new hire.
"Poor kid," Amy murmured to Ela Friday afternoon, watching Jay organize files with what could only be described as reverence. "He's trying so hard to impress Ian, and Ian's treating him like a piece of office equipment."
"Can you blame him?" Ela glanced toward Ian's office, where their boss was reviewing documents. "After what happened with that secretary years ago? Ian's not taking any chances."
"Still." Amy watched Jay polish his computer screen. "The boy's practically glowing every time Ian speaks to him. It's painful to watch."
Across the office, Kim was having a similar conversation with Luc.
"Remember when Leo hired you?" Kim asked, keeping his voice low. "You at least had relevant experience. This one looks like he'd faint if Ian smiled at him."
Luc defended his colleague with good humour. "Give him credit. His work's been solid this week, and he's not pushy about it. Some of Leo's finds have been... more aggressive in their pursuit."
"True. Remember that analyst who kept finding excuses to work late whenever Ian did? At least Jay goes home at five like a normal person. Though I'm not sure if that's professionalism or just terror."
"Probably both. Poor guy seems happy just to be here. Look at him—he's treating those client files like they're made of gold."
Indeed, Jay was handling each document with attention, making neat notes in margins with dedication. His respect for the materials and the processes they represented was either authentic or remarkably well-performed.
"Think Ian's figured out what Leo's doing?" Kim asked.
"Ian figured it out the first time Leo pulled this stunt. He's just too polite to throw qualified candidates out on the street because his friend has a warped sense of humour. Though I suspect Jay's going to be disappointed when he realizes Ian's not interested in office romance."
"Assuming that's what he's after."
"Come on. Look at the way he watches Ian move around the office. If that's not romantic interest, I'll eat my keyboard."
Neither man could see Jay's actual thoughts, which at that moment were focused entirely on whether he should ask Ian about the format for international wire transfer documentation or wait until Monday morning. The complexity of managing client accounts across multiple currencies was fascinating, and Jay wanted to ensure he understood the procedures correctly before handling any actual transactions.
As the workday ended, Ian emerged from his office to find Jay still absorbed in his assignments, making notes in handwriting that belonged in a calligraphy textbook.
"End of the week," Ian announced. "How are you finding the work?"
Jay looked up with an expression of contentment so glaring that Ian felt his suspicions sharpen another degree. "It's exactly what I hoped for. Thank you for the opportunity, and for your patience this week."
"You've done competent work. Keep it up."
The praise was minimal, but Jay received it as if Ian had offered him a promotion. The younger man's delight with such modest acknowledgement was either heartbreakingly innocent or calculatedly manipulative. Ian chose to assume the latter.
Jay gathered his belongings and headed for the elevator, wishing everyone a pleasant weekend.
"Think he'll last?" Amy asked Ela, watching Jay's retreating figure.
"Depends on whether he's really here for the job or for Ian."
From his office doorway, Ian observed the same departure with entirely different concerns. Jay Hall was either the most earnest young man he'd encountered in years, or the most skilful manipulator. Given Ian's history, he knew which possibility he had to prepare for.
Chapter 2: Fitting in
Scene 1
Solitude
Jay woke at six Saturday morning without an alarm. His body had maintained this schedule for years, a habit that served him well in every job he'd held. He rolled from bed and went to the kitchen area, where he filled the electric kettle and spooned pre-ground coffee into a white ceramic mug. A coffee maker was an extravagance his tiny studio simply couldn't accommodate.
While the water heated, he cracked two eggs into a bowl and whisked them with a fork. He sliced a piece of dark bread and set it aside, then poured the eggs into a small pan to make an omelet. His breakfasts were always simple and nutritious, just enough to start the day. 
The kettle clicked off. Jay poured the water into the mug and let the coffee steep while he opened his laptop. The coffee was bitter and strong, exactly how he preferred it. He'd learned to drink it black during college, when cream and sugar were beyond his budget. The financial news website loaded slowly since his Internet connection was the cheapest available, but he had patience for small inconveniences. Oil prices had dropped overnight. The international markets were mixed. Nothing that would directly affect Turner & Associates, but context mattered in this business.
His phone sat silent on the counter. No missed calls, no messages. Saturday mornings had been different once, filled with texts from college friends and the occasional call from his mother. Those connections had faded naturally as geography and circumstances pulled everyone in different directions. He felt no particular sadness about it. People grew apart. That was simply how life worked.
Jay finished his breakfast and brought his coffee to the small table that served as both dining surface and desk to review his notes from the previous week. His work materials occupied one corner: a stack of printed client profiles and a pad where he'd been taking notes.
He pulled out the client summary and read through it again. The company manufactured specialized medical equipment, and their quarterly report showed steady growth in emerging markets. Ian had mentioned them briefly during Thursday's meeting, and Jay wanted to understand the full picture.
The morning passed quietly. Jay worked through his notes, highlighting unfamiliar terms and writing definitions in the margins. Algorithmic trading, derivatives exposure, regulatory compliance—each concept built on others, creating a framework he was still learning to grasp. The financial world had its own language, and mastering it felt like learning to speak again.
At eleven, he made a second cup of coffee and opened his laptop to a financial journalism website. The articles were dense and technical, but he read them patiently, cross-referencing names and companies with his notes. Everything connected to everything else in this industry. Understanding one piece meant understanding how it fit into the larger puzzle.
His phone buzzed. A text came from his mother: "Hope you're having a good weekend. The kids are playing soccer today."
Jay stared at the message for a moment, then typed back: "Thanks. Good luck to them."
He set the phone aside without waiting for a response. His mother's texts arrived sporadically, brief updates about his half-siblings or her husband's job. They felt like messages from a distant planet, well-intentioned but irrelevant to his current life. He preferred it that way.
Lunch was simple, a sandwich made from dark bread, turkey, and cheese, eaten while reading an article about emerging market currencies. He washed the plate immediately and returned to his work. The afternoon stretched ahead, filled with more reading and note-taking.
By evening, Jay had worked through most of his materials. His notes now covered six pages, each topic clearly organized. He felt satisfaction in the work, the same feeling he'd had as a student when a difficult concept finally clicked into place.
Dinner was more substantial. Jay set a pot on the stove and prepared a vegetable stew, adding chicken, beans, and plenty of herbs. He made enough for several days, portioning it into containers to freeze for the week ahead. It was a meal he preferred: healthy, filling, and easy to reheat after long days. Cooking in bulk had become a habit, one less decision to make during the workweek. 
Sunday followed the same pattern. Jay woke early, made coffee, and spent the morning reviewing his notes.
After lunch, it was time to prepare his clothes. He pulled his shirts from the hamper and examined them for stains. They were clean enough to use again, though he'd wash them anyway. He owned seven work shirts, all identical except for minor variations in color, and rotated them to ensure even wear.
He did laundry in the building's basement, feeding coins into the ancient machines and watching for a while as his clothes tumbled clean. The other residents rarely used the laundry room at this hour, which suited him perfectly.
While his clothes washed and dried, he ironed the previous week's shirts. The iron was old but functional, and he'd learned to work around its quirks. Each shirt received meticulous treatement: collar pressed flat, sleeves creased properly, buttons checked for looseness. Appearance mattered at Turner & Associates, and Jay understood that his modest wardrobe needed to be immaculate to compensate for its simplicity.
The single plant in his apartment—a spider plant he'd bought during his first week in the city—sat on the bookshelf. It had thrived despite his minimal care, sending out runners that he'd trimmed back to keep it manageable. The plant was his only concession to decoration, chosen for its resilience.
He finished his preparations by evening. He packed his leather bag, checked that his shirts were properly hung, and set out his clothes for Monday. His apartment looked ready for inspection, every surface clean and every object in its designated place.
As daylight faded outside his window, Jay sat at his small table with dinner and an evening cup of herbal tea. The city buzzed below him, a constant background of traffic and distant conversation. He'd grown accustomed to the noise, though it had taken months to sleep through the sirens and honking horns.
Tomorrow would bring new challenges, more industry jargon to decode, more opportunities to prove himself worthy of the position Leo had given him. But Jay felt no dread at the prospect of Monday morning. Turner & Associates was demanding, but it was also predictable. Ian Hagen was exacting, but he was also fair. The work was complex, but it was complexity Jay could master through study.
He finished his tea and washed the mug, then closed his laptop and turned off the lights. Tomorrow would test him again, but he was ready for it.
Scene 2
Performance
Jay took the metro to the financial district, the route now crowded with a different kind of commuter than he’d known in his previous job. The car filled with employees in dark wool suits, white shirts, polished shoes, and carefully knotted ties. Designer briefcases replaced the worn backpacks he remembered from his old commute to the less prestigious end of town. Jay found a handhold near the door and held his position as more passengers squeezed in at each stop. 
Jay's own tie felt wrong. He'd adjusted it three times before leaving his apartment, but now it seemed too loose, or perhaps too tight. His reflection in the train window showed him what he already knew: he belonged to a different category entirely. His shirt was clean, his tie straight, but everything about him whispered budget store while his fellow passengers proclaimed boutique and bespoke.
He felt the strap of his leather bag against his shoulder. At least that piece looked appropriate, even if it held nothing more valuable than pads and cheap pens. His lunch sat in a plain brown bag tucked inside: a sandwich, wrapped in wax paper and accompanied by an apple.
The train pulled into his station. Jay moved with the crowd toward the exit, then climbed the stairs into morning sunlight. The financial district bustled with purpose, everyone walking faster than seemed humanly necessary. He'd learned to match their pace during his first week, though it still felt like an act of conscious performance.
Turner & Associates occupied an entire floor of an imposing glass tower. Jay arrived at seven-thirty, thirty minutes before the official start of business. The security guard recognized him now and offered a brief wave. The elevator rose smoothly, delivering him to an office that whirred with climate control but remained otherwise silent.
Jay sat at his desk and opened his laptop. Three new emails had arrived since Friday: a client inquiry forwarded by Amy, a meeting reminder from Kim, and a company-wide memo about updated security protocols. He read each one twice, filed them appropriately, and reviewed his calendar for the day. A morning briefing with Ian at nine, a client call at eleven, and a department meeting after lunch.
He pulled out his pad and reviewed the notes he'd made over the weekend. The Maven Holdings summary felt more manageable now that he'd researched their market position and competitive landscape. If Ian asked questions during the meeting, Jay would be ready with answers.
Footsteps echoed in the hallway. Jay looked up to see Ian approaching in a measured and confident stride, dressed in a refined three piece suit.
"Good morning, Jay." Ian's tone was pleasant, neither warm nor cold.
"Good morning."
Ian disappeared into his office without further comment. Jay had noticed that Ian arrived early every day, usually before eight but after Jay's own arrival. Ian never remarked on finding his assistant already at work, but Jay caught Ian looking at him intently, certain he was being evaluated.
The office gradually filled with life. Luc arrived with coffee from the expensive place downstairs, offering Jay a cheerful "Morning!" that Jay returned with what he hoped was appropriate enthusiasm. Amy nodded as she passed, absorbed in her phone. Kim mumbled something that might have been a greeting while juggling his laptop bag and a breakfast pastry.
By eight-fifteen, the department had achieved its normal working atmosphere. Jay lost himself in reading email responses, preferring tasks that required concentration over conversation.
At nine o'clock sharp, Jay knocked on Ian's office door.
"Come in," Ian called.
Jay entered with his notepad, ready to discuss the day's priorities. Ian gestured to the chair across from his desk.
"This morning I wanted to introduce you to some additional aspects of your role. Starting this week, we'll have regular morning briefings like this one. Around nine, though the timing may change depending on our workload."
"That sounds very helpful," Jay said, opening his notepad.
"These meetings will allow us to discuss daily tasks, review priorities, and ensure we're aligned on urgent matters. It's more straightforward than handling everything through email or conversations throughout the day."
"Should I prepare anything specific for these briefings?"
"A general overview of the day's schedule and any items requiring my immediate attention. Nothing elaborate. For today, I need you to compile a summary of the Maven Holdings quarterly performance. Focus on their technology sector investments and changes in their portfolio allocation."
"When do you need that completed?"
"End of week should be sufficient. It's for the board meeting next Monday."
"Understood."
"Excellent. Any questions about today's priorities?"
Jay reviewed his notes quickly. "I think I have everything I need."
"Good. We'll reconvene tomorrow morning at nine unless something urgent develops."
Jay returned to his desk with clear direction for the day ahead. The briefing system would definitely streamline their communication, and he appreciated Ian's approach to managing their workflow.
At twelve-thirty, Amy appeared at his desk. "We're heading to Cornerstone Cafe for lunch. Want to join us?"
Jay's first instinct was to decline politely and eat his brown bag sandwich at his desk. But Amy's invitation was friendly, and he'd learned that refusing too many social overtures could mark someone as antisocial.
"That sounds nice," he said, hoping his hesitation wasn't obvious.
The group consisted of Amy, Luc, Kim, Zoe and Ela, plus Jay trailing slightly behind as they walked to the cafe. They talked about weekend activities, office gossip, commentary on a news article Kim had read that morning. Jay only listened, trying to map the relationships and hierarchies that governed their interactions.
The cafe was crowded and expensive. A simple sandwich cost nearly three times what Jay would normally spend on lunch. He ordered hesitantly, choosing something modest while his colleagues selected elaborate salads and artisanal soups without checking prices.
They found a table near the window. The conversation continued its rapid pace, jumping from work projects to shared memories of previous colleagues. Jay answered direct questions about his hometown and previous job, trying to avoid topics that might invite follow-up inquiries.
"So do you live alone, or...?" Ela asked.
"I prefer my own company," Jay said, which was true without going into the details.
"Lucky you," Luc said. "My roommate leaves dishes in the sink for weeks. I'm thinking about moving out."
The conversation moved to housing costs and neighborhood recommendations. Jay listened but didn't contribute. His own rent consumed nearly half his salary, but that was information nobody needed to know.
Kim made a joke about their IT budget that everyone except Jay found hilarious. Jay produced what he hoped was an appropriate laugh, though he suspected his timing was off. The others didn't seem to notice, or at least didn't comment.
By the time they returned to the office, Jay felt as if he'd completed a marathon. The social performance had required constant attention—monitoring his expressions, remembering to make eye contact without staring. His colleagues seemed to manage these interactions effortlessly, but for Jay each exchange demanded conscious effort.
He spent the afternoon working through client correspondence and preparing materials for tomorrow's meetings. The research restored his equilibrium. This was work he understood, problems he could solve through preparation.
At five o'clock, Jay packed his bag and prepared to leave. Around him, his colleagues were doing the same, gathering coats and bags. Ian's office light remained on, as it had every afternoon since Jay's first day. Jay had never witnessed the hour at which Ian left. It made him wonder just how long Ian really stayed each day.
Jay joined the elevator exodus, riding down with Amy and Kim, who were discussing dinner plans. He nodded goodbye in the lobby and walked toward the subway station, already planning his evening. Grocery shopping for tomorrow, reheated dinner, thirty minutes of reading industry publications, an hour of reading client files, shower then early sleep to prepare for Tuesday's challenges.
The twenty-minute commute home passed uneventfully. Jay held his position while the train filled and emptied at each stop. His reflection in the window showed the same face that had ridden downtown that morning, but now it bore the satisfaction of another successful day.
Scene 3
Mistake
Tuesday's lunch invitation came from Luc, Wednesday's from Kim. By Thursday, Jay realized that the group simply absorbed him without discussion. At twelve-thirty, someone appeared at his desk saying "Ready for lunch?" and Jay would close his laptop and follow them to whichever restaurant they'd chosen that day.
He stopped bringing his brown bag sandwiches on Wednesday, tired of taking them home uneaten and having to incorporate them into his dinner. The restaurant meals costs forced him to recalculate his monthly budget. He could handle the expense, but he'd need to cut somewhere else. Maybe the coffee shop near his apartment, where he occasionally treated himself to a real cappuccino. Or the small indulgences at the grocery store—the good olive oil, fresh herbs he rarely used but bought anyway. These adjustments felt manageable, even necessary. Fitting in required investment. 
"Max gets back week after next," Ela mentioned over Thursday's soup and salad. "He's been island-hopping for three weeks. Lucky bastard."
"Wasn't he just at the seaside last month?" Amy asked.
"That was a long weekend," Luc said. "This is his real vacation. He's been planning it since Christmas."
Jay listened to their casual discussion of international travel with the same fascination he might have shown for accounts of space exploration. The longest trip he'd ever taken was a four-day seaside vacation, and that had required months of saving. The idea of spending three weeks on a tropical island existed in a realm so far from his experience that he couldn't even calculate what it might cost.
"You travel much, Jay?" Kim asked.
"Not really," Jay said, which was both true and sufficient.
The conversation moved to a concert Amy wanted to attend, a new restaurant Luc had discovered, Ela's plans to visit her sister. Jay contributed responses when asked direct questions but mostly listened, marvelling at the abundance that seemed to surround his colleagues.
On Thursday afternoon, a crisis erupted that felt monumental to Jay and barely registered with anyone else. At four-forty, while reviewing a client portfolio summary, he discovered an error in his calculations. The numbers were wrong—not dramatically, but wrong enough to affect the quarterly projections he'd prepared for Ian's review.
Jay stared at his screen, rechecking the formulas and feeling his stomach contract with each confirmation of the mistake. He'd built the spreadsheet carefully, double-checking each entry, but somewhere in the process he'd mixed up some figures and the error persisted in his subsequent calculations.
The office was winding down around him. Colleagues were closing laptops and gathering bags, their conversations moving from work projects to evening plans. Jay remained frozen at his desk, paralysed by the magnitude of his failure. He could stay late and rebuild the entire analysis, but that would take hours and still wouldn't erase the fact that he'd made such a basic error.
"Planning to work late?"
Jay looked up to find Ian standing beside his desk. His voice made it clear he was paying closer attention than he let on.
"I made an error," Jay said, gesturing helplessly at his screen. "In the portfolio analysis. The quarterly projections are wrong."
Ian moved around to look at Jay's monitor. Jay braced himself for criticism, perhaps a lecture about the importance of accuracy in their business. Instead, Ian examined the spreadsheet for a moment, then pointed to a specific cell. "Here's where it started. You transposed these two figures, which cascaded through the rest of the calculation."
He pulled up a chair and sat beside Jay, fingers moving across the keyboard. "See this formula? It should reference column D, not column C. Change that, and the rest will correct automatically."
Jay watched the numbers realign, the error disappearing as cleanly as it had appeared. "I'm sorry. I should have caught that before—"
"Everyone makes mistakes. The important thing is finding them before they reach clients. You did exactly what you should have done."
Jay remained at his desk long after Ian had left, reviewing every document he'd prepared that day. He checked formulas and verified calculations obsessively, determined never to repeat the same error. The office grew quiet around him, cleaning staff arriving to empty wastebaskets and wipe down surfaces.
At seven-forty-five, Jay finally closed his laptop and gathered his belongings. Ian's office light was still on. Through the glass partition, Jay could see Ian at his desk, absorbed in whatever work required his attention well past normal business hours.
Jay paused in the hallway, wondering if Ian worked twelve-hour days regularly or if tonight was an exception. The dedication seemed both admirable and exhausting—impressive in its discipline but depressing in its isolation. Ian ate lunch alone most days, rarely joined the group conversations in the break room, and apparently had no commitments that required him to leave the office at a reasonable hour.
The metro ride home passed in contemplative silence. Jay found a spot near the door and let his mind replay the afternoon's events. Ian's reaction to the error had surprised him completely. No lectures, just practical help and acceptance that mistakes happened. It was exactly the response Jay had hoped for but hadn't dared expect.
Back in his apartment, Jay reheated his dinner, eating at his small table while reading news articles on his laptop. He washed his plate immediately and returned to his work materials, reviewing his notes and preparing for tomorrow's meetings.
In bed later, with the lights out and the city's distant noise filtering through his window, Jay revisited the day's social interactions. Had he laughed appropriately at Kim's joke about the new software? Had his response to Amy's question about weekend plans sounded too curt? Did his colleagues find him acceptable, or were they simply too polite to exclude him openly?
The questions circled through his mind, each one echoing his larger fear: that he would never truly belong in this world, that his life would always require conscious performance. His colleagues' kindness felt authentic, but it also felt provisional, dependent on his continued ability to remain pleasant.
But as sleep began to claim him, Jay returned to Ian's calm response to his error. The absence of judgement, the practical help, the simple acknowledgement that mistakes were part of learning—it represented something Jay had rarely experienced. Not warmth, but fairness. Respect for his efforts even when they fell short.
It wasn't much, but it felt like solid ground beneath his feet. Jay could rest in the knowledge that his mistakes wouldn't define him here. Ian had shown him grace when he'd expected criticism. Jay closed his eyes and let the sounds of the city lull him toward sleep, holding tight to the memory of Ian's reassuring mentorship.
Scene 4
Avoidance
On Friday morning the office moved at a gentler pace, as if everyone had collectively agreed to ease into the weekend. Jay arrived at seven-thirty, finding comfort in early start and preparation.
The investment analysis report sat in his inbox like a challenge he'd been wrestling with all week. Jay had drafted it twice, scrapped both versions, and started over with a different approach. The client's portfolio contained unusual holdings that required additional explanation, and Jay had struggled to find the right balance between detail and clarity.
This morning, the words flowed more easily. Jay worked through the analysis, checking each calculation and verifying every data point. By eleven-thirty, he had a complete draft that he felt confident submitting. He printed a copy for his own review, then sent the electronic version to Ian with a brief note requesting feedback.
Ian's response arrived within twenty minutes—a calendar invitation for a meeting at noon. Jay spent the intervening time second-guessing every paragraph, wondering if his conclusions were too bold or his recommendations too conservative. The investment world demanded confidence, but Jay feared that overconfidence could be equally dangerous.
The meeting lasted fifteen minutes. Ian read through the report, occasionally making notes in the margins. Jay waited, trying to read Ian's expression for clues about the document's quality.
"This is solid work," Ian said finally, setting the report aside. "Your analysis of the market exposure is comprehensive. The client will appreciate the level of detail."
Jay felt a surge of relief that he hoped didn't show on his face. "Thank you. I wanted to make sure I understood all the implications before making recommendations."
"Good instinct. Send it to the client this afternoon." Ian made a final note and handed the document back. "Well done."
The brief exchange left Jay energized for the rest of the day. Ian's feedback meant more than casual praise from colleagues who were still essentially strangers. His approval was valuable because it had to be earned.
Lunch followed the established pattern—the team's migration to whichever restaurant had caught someone's attention that day. Jay had grown more comfortable with the financial reality of these daily meals after adjusting his budget. The conversations still felt foreign, filled with references to experiences and assumptions he didn't share, but he'd learned to manage them without embarrassing himself.
"Any weekend plans, Jay?" Luc asked as they walked back from the sushi place Amy had chosen.
"Nothing special," Jay replied, which was true. "Catching up on some reading. Maybe a movie."
"You should check out that new art installation downtown. It's supposed to be amazing. Very interactive."
Jay nodded politely, though he had no intention of seeking out art installations. His weekends were structured around practical necessities—cleaning, laundry, grocery shopping, preparation for the following week. Entertainment was a treat he rarely allowed himself, and when he did, it took the form of a book from the library or a documentary on his laptop.
"Or there's that new craft brewery nearby," Kim added. "They're supposed to have incredible small-batch stuff."
The conversation moved on to various weekend options, each suggestion marked by prices that made Jay glad for his preference for solitude. His colleagues' casual discussions of extravagant dinners and theatre tickets reminded him constantly of the gulf between their financial realities and his own.
In the afternoon Jay worked through correspondence and prepared materials for Monday's meetings, enjoying the orderly progression of tasks completed and filed away. The office moved in its Friday atmosphere—productive but not frantic.
At four-thirty, Luc appeared at Jay's desk with a smile that seemed to be his default expression. "We're heading to Murphy's for drinks. Want to join us?"
Jay's pulse quickened. The invitation was casual, friendly, and completely expected—Friday afternoon drinks were apparently as routine as daily lunches. But the prospect of spending two hours in a crowded bar while trying to contribute to conversations about topics he knew nothing about felt overwhelming.
"I appreciate the invitation, but I have some errands to take care of this evening," Jay said, manufacturing what he hoped was a regretful smile.
"No problem. Maybe next week." 
"Next time for sure. No pressure, though. We know not everyone's into the after-work scene," Amy added, overhearing the exchange.
The group gathered their belongings with the cheerfulness of people anticipating weekend freedom. Jay watched them preparing to leave, their lives seeming to flow seamlessly from work obligations into social activities.
"Have a good weekend, Jay," Kim called out as the group headed toward the elevators. Several others offered similar farewells in a warm tone.
Jay returned their waves and sat back at his desk. The office fell quiet except for the distant sound of cleaning crews beginning their evening rounds. He took advantage of the silence to complete a final review of his email correspondence, ensuring nothing urgent had been overlooked.
Ian's office light remained on, as it did most evenings. Through the glass wall, Jay could see him on a phone call with a serious expression. It was starting to become apparent that Ian worked longer hours than anyone else in the department, consistently arriving early and staying late.
As Jay packed his bag and prepared to leave, Ian concluded his call and looked up from his desk. Their eyes met briefly through the glass, and Ian offered a small acknowledging motion—barely more than a slight inclination of his head, but unmistakably positive. Another week completed satisfactorily. Another small confirmation that Jay was meeting expectations.
Jay returned the acknowledgement and headed for the elevators. The lobby was busy with evening commuters and building staff, but the crowd thinned as he reached the street. Office workers were heading home or toward the bars and restaurants where they would decompress from the week's demands.
Jay walked toward the subway station, feeling the satisfaction of another successful week behind him. The ride home passed in peace. In a few hours, his colleagues would be sharing drinks and weekend stories, deepening the personal connections. Jay felt no envy about missing that experience. He'd found what he needed at Turner & Associates—structured environment where his strengths could shine.
Scene 5
Fear
Ian reviewed the investment analysis Jay had submitted that afternoon, marking corrections in the margins with his fountain pen. The work was competent—comprehensive research, logical conclusions, clear presentation. Jay had improved noticeably over the past two weeks, properly adapting to the firm's standards.
Which made Ian's persistent unease all the more troubling.
He set the report aside and pulled up Jay's employment file on his computer. The resume was modest but honest—state university education, six years at three decent firms, references that checked out when Leo had called them. Jay Hall appeared to be exactly what his credentials showed: a competent but unremarkable young man seeking stability and advancement.
The problem was that Sam Connelly's credentials had been equally unremarkable. Sam had presented himself as eager and slightly overwhelmed by the opportunity.
Jay exhibited nearly identical patterns. The early arrivals that looked like dedication but could indicate surveillance. The attention to appearance that showed respect for office culture but might serve as camouflage. The humble background that invited protective instincts but provided perfect cover for someone with sinister intentions.
Ian had spent two weeks waiting for Jay to reveal his true purpose, and Jay's complete failure to do so only heightened Ian's suspicions. Sam had been subtle but not invisible—casual questions about client relationships, innocent observations about office security, friendly curiosity about Ian's personal life. Jay asked no questions beyond those required for his work and maintained almost painful politeness in all their interactions.
The restraint felt calculated. Designed to lull Ian into the same complacency that had nearly destroyed his career once before.
"Working late again? It's Friday evening, Ian. Normal people have left for the weekend."
Ian looked up to find Leo standing in his doorway, tie loosened and jacket slung over his shoulder. Leo's definition of appropriate office attire had always been flexible, especially after business hours.
"I'm finishing up," Ian said, though his desk held enough work to occupy him for another two hours. "You should go enjoy your weekend."
"Not without my favorite CFO." Leo entered the office uninvited and dropped into one of the chairs facing Ian's desk. "How's our new addition working out? Jay seems to be fitting in well."
"He's competent."
"That's high praise from you. I remember when you described your last assistant as barely functional."
"Jay completes his assignments on time and follows instructions accurately. His work requires minimal revision."
"But you don't trust him."
"No. I don't."
Leo laughed with delight. "You're incredible. The kid shows up early, works hard, causes no problems, and you're convinced he's plotting against you. What exactly do you think he's doing? Stealing paper clips? Taking photos of your calendar?"
"I think he's being very careful not to show his hand too early."
"His hand? Ian, sometimes a modest young man is just a modest young man. Not everyone who works for you is running a long con."
Ian returned to his report, making notations in the margins. Leo's amusement was understandable but irrelevant. Leo hadn't lived through the Sam Connelly disaster. Leo hadn't spent months rebuilding his reputation while competing firms whispered about his judgment and competence.
"You know what you need?" Leo stood and walked to the credenza where Ian kept a small collection of glasses and a bottle of scotch for client meetings. "A drink. It's Friday evening, we're technically off the clock, and you're giving yourself an ulcer over an assistant who probably goes home and reads financial journals for fun."
"It's not appropriate to drink in the office."
"It's my father's office, technically, and he's been known to keep a bottle of bourbon in his desk drawer." Leo poured two fingers of scotch into each glass. "Besides, we're not drinking in the office. We're having a civilized conversation between friends who happen to be in an office."
Ian accepted the glass but didn't drink. Leo raised his own in a mock toast. "To paranoia and the fascinating ways it manifests in brilliant minds."
"To knowing where to draw the line," Ian countered, taking a small sip. The scotch was excellent, with enough warmth to chase away the fatigue of a long day.
They drank without talking for several minutes. Leo had always possessed the ability to fill quiet spaces without making them awkward, a skill Ian envied but had never mastered. Their friendship had survived the Sam Connelly scandal, Ian's family disowning him, and Leo's father’s initial disapproval of hiring someone with Ian’s complicated history. Leo might be a menace in countless ways, but to Ian he had proven himself time and again to be trustworthy—perhaps the most trustworthy person in his life.
"You're so convinced that everyone has ulterior motives that you can't recognize honest intentions when they're right in front of you."
"Experience teaches caution."
"Experience teaches paranoia if you let it. You've built a perfect life here, Ian. Successful career, financial security, the respect of your colleagues. But what's the point of having everything you want if you're too afraid to enjoy any of it?"
"I'm content with my life."
"Bullshit. You work non stop, eat dinner alone and haven't taken a real vacation in three years. You've turned contentment into a fortress, and now you're so busy defending it that you've forgotten what you were trying to protect in the first place."
Ian walked to the window. The financial district spread below him, office buildings glowing against the darkening sky. Somewhere out there, his colleagues were beginning their weekends—dinners with friends, dates with romantic partners, family gatherings that provided connection and meaning.
"My life works," Ian said finally. "It's stable and entirely under my control. That's worth protecting."
"Is it? Or is it just the safest option available?" Leo joined him at the window. "I'm not saying you should trust everyone who walks through that door. But maybe you could consider the possibility that not everyone is Sam Connelly. Maybe some people are exactly who they appear to be."
Ian bristled, turning away from the window. "You've meddled enough already, Leo. Drop it."
"I can't drop it when I see what's happening. Jay looked so lost this week. He can't find his place among all these accomplished colleagues, and he could use some comfort from his supervisor instead of this cold distance."
"That's preposterous," Ian said sharply.
Leo raised his hands in a gesture of surrender. "I'm just making suggestions. No need to get so defensive about it." He finished his drink and set the glass on Ian's desk. "I'm heading home to a weekend of questionable decisions and excellent company. You should try it sometime."
After Leo left, Ian returned to his desk and the stack of documents. He had no intention of providing comfort to Jay Hall, regardless of how lost the young man might appear. If Jay was struggling with the social demands of his position, he would adapt or find work elsewhere. If his vulnerability was a performance, Ian wouldn't be taken in by it. 
He worked through the remaining reports, making corrections and preparing materials for Monday's meetings. By nine o'clock, he had completed everything that absolutely required his attention. He could stay later—there were always additional projects, long-term analyses that would benefit from extra attention. But Leo's words lingered in his mind.
Ian packed his briefcase and turned off his office lights. The elevator descended through floors of empty offices, delivering him to a weekend that would be solitary and predictable. He would review industry publications and prepare for upcoming client meetings. It was a good life. A life that no one could disrupt or destroy because no one was close enough to matter. Jay Hall might be the threat Ian suspected, or he might be as innocent as he appeared to be. Either way, the result would be the same. Some lessons were too expensive to learn twice.
Chapter 3: Establishing himself
Scene 1
Small comforts
Jay woke up happy on Monday morning. He’d spent the past two days much as he always did, finding comfort in tasks at home. He didn’t mind the end of the weekend, quite the opposite, he was content with the prospect of going to work. He arrived at the office thirty minutes before the official start of business. The security guard offered his customary wave, the elevator brought him smoothly to the thirty-second floor, and his desk welcomed him with the stack of materials he'd organized Friday evening.
The investment portfolio he'd been analyzing required final adjustments before submission to the client. Jay worked through the calculations, double-checking his conclusions with the source documents. The spreadsheet error from the previous week had taught him valuable lessons about verification.
Ian arrived at eight, offering his customary greeting before disappearing into his office. Jay had grown accustomed to Ian's courtesy, though he felt an obvious distance in their interactions. Ian was fair and supportive when Jay needed guidance, but his manner indicated he was monitoring not just Jay's performance but his overall conduct in the office.
Jay didn't mind the scrutiny. He'd expected it, given his modest credentials. Earning Ian's complete trust would take time, and Jay was prepared to demonstrate his reliability through consistent competence.
On Wednesday, Jay made an unexpected discovery. The team’s lunch rotation had landed on Willow & Sage, a cosy bistro not far from the office that he had never noticed during his previous explorations of the neighborhood. The interior was warmly lit and comfortable, with plush sofas arranged around low tables and a menu that emphasized artisanal ingredients.
Jay ordered a sandwich made with herb-crusted bread and filled with vegetables he couldn't  identify but found delicious. The price was higher than his lunch budget allowed, but the quality justified the expense. More importantly, the bistro was less crowded than their normal destinations, creating space for conversation without the press of neighboring tables and competing noise.
"This place is great," Jay said, sitting on one of the armchairs with his sandwich. "I can't believe I walked past it so many times without noticing."
"It's been here for about a year," Amy explained. "The owner used to work at some fancy place downtown before opening this spot."
Jay took another bite, savouring the complex flavours and textures. The herb bread was dense but not heavy, offering a complexity that worked in harmony with the filling instead of overshadowing it. "It's really good. I might have to come back here on my own sometime."
His enthusiasm seemed to resonate with the group. Luc smiled approvingly, and even Kim looked up from his phone to agree that the food was good. Jay realized he'd found something valuable—a lunch spot that felt relaxing. Having a place in the neighbourhood that felt welcoming would make the daily lunch outings less stressful.
Thursday afternoon, Jay decided to explore the area around Northlight Financial Center more thoroughly. He'd been working there for almost three weeks but had seen little beyond the direct route between the office and various restaurants. The financial district revealed itself to be more varied than he'd initially realized, with small parks tucked between the imposing towers.
A short walk north from the office, Jay discovered a pocket park that seemed to exist in defiance of its surroundings. Trees provided shade over benches and walking paths, while a small fountain created a buffer against the constant traffic noise. Office workers occupied some of the benches, but the space wasn't crowded and felt peaceful.
Jay walked the perimeter of the park. He probably wouldn't have many opportunities to spend time here since his schedule was tightly structured around office hours and team lunches, but knowing the space existed felt reassuring. If he ever needed a few minutes to collect his thoughts or simply escape the office life, this place would be available.
Friday morning brought news that would reshape the team's dynamics for the foreseeable future. Ela arrived with updates about Max, the senior analyst who'd been on vacation.
"Max got some kind of tropical bug," Ela explained during their morning coffee break. "Nothing serious, but he's stuck in quarantine for another week, and then he wants to extend his trip to recuperate. He won't be back for at least three more weeks."
"Poor guy," Luc said, though his tone indicated limited sympathy. "Stuck on a tropical for an extra month. The hardships we endure."
Jay had heard Max mentioned frequently. Senior analyst, four years with the company, known for taking elaborate vacations and producing exceptional client reports. His extended absence had created additional work for everyone, particularly Ian, who had been covering Max's client relationships while managing his regular responsibilities.
"We're lucky Jay was hired when he was," Amy observed. "The workload would have been impossible to manage without the extra help."
"Definitely," Ela agreed. "Jay's been handling twice the normal workload for a new hire, and doing it well."
Jay felt a flush of pride at the recognition, though he tried not to let it show. His colleagues' approval mattered more than he'd expected. These people had welcomed him into their community and now openly acknowledged his contributions. 
In the afternoon, Luc came with the weekly invitation to after-work drinks. Jay had been expecting the question and had already prepared his response.
"I appreciate the invitation," Jay said, maintaining the apologetic tone that had worked for previous refusals. "I can't make it tonight, but if you're planning to go out next week, I'd like to join you then."
The answer clearly surprised the group. Luc's eyebrows rose slightly, and Amy looked pleased by the prospect of Jay's participation.
"Absolutely," Amy said. "We hit Murphy's or somewhere similar on Friday afternoons. Nothing fancy, just a chance to unwind after the week."
"We can't wait," Ela added. "It'll be fun to get to know you outside of work mode."
Jay managed what he hoped was an enthusiastic smile. "I'm looking forward to it."
The commitment felt both necessary and terrifying. Jay understood that continued refusal to participate in social activities would eventually mark him as uninterested in building relationships with his colleagues. But the prospect of spending an evening in a crowded bar created anxiety that he'd need an additional time to process.
Still, it was a manageable concession. One Friday evening every now and then seemed like a reasonable price to pay for workplace acceptance. If he could master the complex calculations and industry knowledge required for his job, he could probably learn to get through after-work socializing as well.
Scene 2
Offering input
Three weeks at Turner & Associates had taught Jay the patterns that governed office life. Mondays were focused, as if everyone was calibrating their approach to the week ahead. By Tuesday, the pace would intensify. Wednesday brought the week's heaviest workload. Thursday was for refinement and preparation. Friday offered the gentle deceleration toward weekend freedom.
As he started his fourth week, Jay had learned to match these rhythms, adjusting his own schedule to complement the team's collective momentum. He submitted reports early in the week when Ian had time for detailed review. He saved less important correspondence for Thursday afternoons when the office atmosphere was more relaxed. He prepared materials for the following week on Friday mornings.
The company structure also became clearer with each passing day. With just under a hundred employees total, the organization felt almost intimate. Jay's team held the central position, managing relationships with the firm's crown jewel accounts while three smaller teams handled the bread-and-butter contracts. Jay had already committed every client name to memory—a manageable feat given the list contained fewer than twenty entries. The top four clients received treatment bordering on reverence, and Jay had taken to studying their profiles each evening at his kitchen table, their key details arranged on his refrigerator like a shrine.
Ian remained distant but fair. He never asked anything of Jay that wasn’t strictly work related. Jay didn’t make his coffee or sort out any personal affairs. Their daily interactions followed predictable patterns—brief meetings to review assignments, quick consultations about client requirements, occasional corrections.
Jay kept observing Ian, how he handled client calls with unfailing composure, the way he managed tight deadlines with a calmness that never put undue pressure on the team. Everything about Ian demonstrated excellence Jay had only imagined possible. His previous bosses had been either erratic and demanding or inappropriate. Ian was everything these men weren’t: competent, respectful, skilled at his work.
The admiration felt dangerous somehow, too intense for a workplace relationship. Jay worked to keep his composure when Ian explained financial strategies, fought to suppress the eager questions that bubbled up during their meetings. He told himself this was simple respect, nothing more complicated than recognizing superior competence. But he knew it was more than that. It was happiness at being mentored by someone of Ian’s caliber. He felt lucky to have been given this opportunity.
On Thursday morning Ian appeared at Jay's desk with Amy, the senior analyst whose sharp intelligence intimidated most people in the office.
"We have a strategy session in fifteen minutes," Ian said. "Conference room B. I'd like you to join us."
Jay tried to hide his nervousness. "Should I bring anything specific?"
"The Wentworth portfolio files. Amy's been reviewing their risk exposure, and I want a fresh perspective on the client communications we've been handling."
"Have you reviewed the quarterly reports?" Amy asked.
"Yes. I've been tracking the correspondence about their concerns regarding the tech sector allocation."
"Good. That's exactly what we need to discuss." 
The conference room felt exclusive, from the thick carpet underfoot to the weighty glass decanters set out on a sideboard. Jay sat across from Amy and Ian at the head of a long table of dark, gleaming oak. Nervousness crept up his spine—the same feeling he'd experienced during college presentations, multiplied by the stakes of this environment.
Amy opened a thick folder. "Wentworth's been questioning our technology sector weighting for three months. Their returns have been solid, but they're spooked by market volatility."
Ian turned to a page of charts. "The numbers support our current strategy, but client confidence matters more than being right if they pull their investment. What's their specific concern?" 
Amy looked up from her notes. "They think we're overexposed. Twenty-three percent in tech when the market average is eighteen."
"But their risk tolerance profile said they wanted aggressive growth," Jay said, remembering the client files he read.
Ian paused, his pen halfway to the paper. "Go on."
Heat rose in Jay's face. Both of them were watching him now, waiting. "I just—when I was organizing their files, I noticed they specifically requested higher-return strategies. They seemed willing to accept volatility for growth potential."
"That was six months ago," Amy said. "Market conditions change. Client comfort levels change."
"Right, but..." Jay felt himself fumbling, his thoughts scattered under their scrutiny. "The correspondence I've been handling—they're not asking us to reduce risk. They're asking for reassurance about our decision-making process. They want to understand why we believe in the allocation, not necessarily for us to change it."
Ian set down his pen entirely. "Explain that."
"Their emails don't request portfolio adjustments. They ask questions about our research methodology, about how we evaluate tech companies versus traditional sectors. It reads like they want education, not modification."
Amy flipped through several pages. "He's right. Look at this—'Can you explain your analysis of cloud computing market projections?' Not 'Should we reduce our exposure to cloud computing companies?'"
"So they need confidence in our expertise, not a different strategy," Ian said.
Jay's pulse hammered in his ears. "Maybe. I could be wrong. I'm just going by the tone of their communications."
Ian made a note on his pad. "That's useful insight. Amy, what do you think about addressing their questions directly instead of proposing portfolio changes?"
"It makes sense. Less disruptive, and it builds the relationship and doesn't look like we made mistakes initially."
They spent another twenty minutes developing a response strategy. Jay contributed when asked but mostly listened, absorbing how they analyzed problems from multiple angles, how they balanced client psychology with financial logic.
When the meeting ended, Ian gathered his papers. "Good observation, Jay. Sometimes the obvious solution isn't the right one."
Amy packed up her folder. "Not bad for someone who's been here three weeks."
After they left, Jay remained in the conference room, staring out at the city skyline. His hands still trembled slightly from the adrenaline. He'd managed to contribute something worthwhile, hadn't completely embarrassed himself. Ian had acknowledged his input and treated his reasoning as legitimate.
The afternoon continued with standard tasks, but Jay kept returning to those moments in the conference room. The way Ian had listened to his explanation, had built on his suggestion instead of dismissing it. He'd worked for his previous boss for three years and never once felt that his ideas mattered. Ian had given him that feeling in a single meeting.
By the time he left work, Jay had replayed the conversation a dozen times. Part of him burned with shame at how he'd stumbled through his explanation. But a larger part felt something he hadn't experienced in years: the joy of being heard, of contributing meaningfully to something important. Ian had asked for his perspective and actually listened to the answer. In Jay's limited experience, that was extraordinary.
Scene 3
Going out
On Friday afternoon, talk of weekend plans filled the office. Jay had promised Luc he would join them this time. For weeks, he'd declined their invitations, citing other arrangements. The excuses were mostly true but incomplete. The real reason was simpler: he didn't drink much and didn't enjoy crowded bars.
But Luc had been persistent, and Amy had mentioned that the Friday tradition helped new employees feel included. Jay had finally agreed, but the commitment sat uneasily with him all week—he'd even spent some time Thursday evening practicing conversation topics in his bathroom mirror, then felt ridiculous about it.
The bar they chose throbbed with music and conversation. Exposed brick walls absorbed none of the sound, and the crowd pressed close around high tables. Jay arrived ten minutes late, hoping the others would already be deep in conversation and his entrance would go unnoticed.
"There he is!" Kim called out, raising a beer bottle. "We were starting to think you'd chickened out."
"Just had trouble finding the place," Jay said, which was partially true. He'd circled the building twice, gathering courage.
Kim pushed a beer toward him. "First round's on the company account.”
Jay accepted the bottle gratefully. Something to do with his hands. The beer was cold and tasted better than he'd expected, but it still sat untouched after the first few sips—the bitter flavor reminded him of college parties where he'd stood awkwardly against walls.
"So Amy's been here longest, right?" Jay asked during a lull in conversation.
"Eight years," Amy confirmed.
"Amy basically runs the analytical side of everything," Ela added. "Ian trusts her judgment completely."
Kim raised his glass. "To Amy, who makes the rest of us look competent."
The conversation flowed around him like water around a stone. Ela told stories about difficult clients who called at impossible hours. Amy shared gossip about acquisitions in their sector. Kim complained about outdated computer systems. Jay listened, laughed when appropriate, asked occasional questions.
"What about you, Jay?" Amy asked during a brief pause. "What did you do before Turner & Associates?"
"Administrative work. Nothing interesting."
"Come on," Kim pressed. "Everyone has stories from terrible jobs. Where was this?"
"A small consulting firm. Really, it wasn't worth mentioning."
Jay took another sip of his beer, hoping they'd move on. They did, but he caught Luc watching him.
The evening progressed casually. Sometimes the group clustered together, trading inside jokes and references Jay didn't understand. Other times conversations split into pairs, and Jay  talked with whoever happened to be nearest. The music made everything feel slightly surreal, like watching a movie of normal people having normal fun.
"You know who never comes to these things?" Ela said, sittling back on her chair after returning from the bar. "Zoe. Sweet girl, but she's practically invisible at the office."
"She's just shy," Amy said. "Like Jay here."
Jay felt heat rise in his face. "I'm not really shy. Just prefer smaller groups."
"Nothing wrong with that," Kim said. "Some people need more processing time."
"Speaking of people who never show up," Amy said, grinning at something over Jay's shoulder. "Anyone want to bet on whether we could get Ian to join us sometime?"
Jay's attention sharpened. "Does he not like these kinds of places?"
"Ian doesn't do informal gatherings," Amy said. "Too old-fashioned for after-work drinks."
"He's never come? Not even once?" Jay asked.
Kim and Luc exchanged a quick look that Jay missed entirely. "Nope. Not his style."
"Maybe he has other commitments," Jay said. "Family obligations or something."
"Ian doesn't have family obligations," Ela said with a laugh. "Trust me, his calendar is work, gym, sleep, repeat."
"He's married to the job," Kim added. "Which works out great for the rest of us since he's basically perfect at it."
Jay nodded, filing away this information. It seemed sad somehow, that someone as competent and respected as Ian would isolate himself so completely. Maybe success required that kind of sacrifice.
By nine-thirty, the noise and crowd had worn Jay down to exhaustion. His beer had grown warm  and his social energy felt completely depleted. He waited for a natural break in conversation.
"I should probably head home," he said, standing and reaching for his jacket. "Early morning tomorrow."
"It's Friday night!" Kim protested. "Saturday morning doesn't count as early."
"I know, but I'm not much of a night owl. Thanks for including me, though. This was nice."
"We'll do this again soon," Amy said. "Maybe somewhere quieter next time."
Luc stood as well. "Actually, I should get going too. Mind if I walk with you to the metro?"
They said their goodbyes and stepped into the cooler evening air. The contrast felt wonderful after the bar's stuffiness.
"Not your scene?" Luc asked as they walked.
"Not really. But I'm glad I came. Everyone's been very welcoming."
"The team's good people. Takes time to find your place with any group."
They walked in silence for a while. Luc seemed to understand that Jay needed time to decompress.
"Leo hired me under similar circumstances," Luc said eventually. "Gave me a chance when I really needed one. Sometimes the best opportunities come from unexpected places."
Jay glanced at him. "Similar circumstances?"
"Oh, you know. Right person at the right time. Lucky break."
"Well, I'm thankful he took a chance on me."
"Leo's good at seeing potential in people."
They reached the metro entrance. "Thanks for the company," Jay said. "And for all the help with office procedures these past weeks. I know I've asked a lot of questions."
"No problem. We all need guidance starting out."
They parted ways at the turnstiles, Luc heading north while Jay descended to the southbound platform. The train was nearly empty, the Friday night crowd having dispersed to their various destinations.
Jay found a seat and closed his eyes, letting the gentle rocking of the car ease the tension in his shoulders. The evening had been more draining than he'd expected, but not unpleasant. He'd learned things about his colleagues that would make Monday morning conversations easier. They'd accepted his early departure without making him feel guilty or antisocial.
Most importantly, he'd demonstrated that he could handle these situations. He didn't have to be the most social person in the room or the most entertaining conversationalist. He just had to show up, participate honestly, and be himself.
The detail about Ian never joining after-work gatherings felt important, though Jay couldn't articulate why. It reinforced his impression of Ian as the type to draw a clear line between his job and his private affairs. Jay respected that approach, even admired it. It seemed clean, uncomplicated.
By the time he reached his apartment, Jay felt the particular tiredness that came from successful social effort. He'd pushed himself outside his comfort zone and survived. Tomorrow he could retreat into solitude to recharge, but tonight he could feel proud.
Scene 4
Office culture
Jay spent the weekend in his apartment, doing absolutely nothing productive. The quiet felt restorative after Friday's social experiment. He made simple meals, organized his closet, and made no plans beyond basic maintenance. Wasting time felt earned after nearly a month of devoting all his free hours to work materials. By Sunday evening, he was ready to return to work.
On Monday, Jay sat at his desk knowing exactly how his day would unfold. He operated the office coffee maker without fumbling with the settings, selecting his preferred medium roast blend. He grabbed a package of artisanal trail mix with dried cherries and dark chocolate pieces from the employee kitchen. Four weeks ago, he'd packed sad sandwiches and plain fruits. Now he trusted the office provisions. The change from nervous newcomer to functioning team member had happened gradually, almost without his notice.
His desk had become truly his. The monitor was adjusted to the perfect height. His supplies were organized according to his preferences. The client files were arranged in the system that made sense to his workflow.
These changes felt monumental to him, even if they appeared trivial to everyone else. The casual abundance of quality food, the assumption that employees deserved good coffee, the unstated message that his comfort mattered—all of it represented a standard of life he'd only imagined.
The week progressed normally, updating client contact databases, preparing materials for  portfolio reviews, responding to correspondence about account maintenance. Jay moved through the tasks with growing confidence, no longer triple-checking every word before sending the email. 
On Thursday, Ian appeared at Jay's desk with a folder in hand. Jay expected a brief exchange—assignment delivery and quick clarification.
Instead, Ian paused after handing over the documents. "I wanted to mention that your work on the Wentworth’s case has been excellent. Your attention to the nuances in their concerns made a real difference in how we approached the situation."
Jay looked up, startled by the unexpected praise. "I just tried to read what they were actually asking for."
"Exactly. That kind of analysis is valuable. The client responded very positively to our revised approach."
"Thank you," Jay managed, feeling heat rise in his face.
Throughout the day, Ian made similar rounds. He paused at Amy's desk to acknowledge her risk assessment insights. He thanked Kim for resolving a technical issue ahead of schedule. He complimented Ela on her handling of a difficult client.
The pattern revealed something Jay hadn't fully appreciated before. Ian didn't just manage through assignments and deadlines. He noticed good work and took time to recognize it. The praise wasn't dramatic, but it was honest.
Jay watched these interactions with growing admiration. Ian's leadership style created an atmosphere where people wanted to excel, not because they feared criticism but because they valued his respect. The office culture that had impressed Jay from his first day stemmed largely from Ian's approach. This was true leadership, the kind Jay had read about but never experienced. Ian had built a team that functioned at the highest level.
The warm feeling persisted throughout the afternoon. The praise felt less personal now, but just as meaningful. Jay had been specifically noticed for quality he took pride in. His work met Ian's exacting standards. The clear expectations and recognition felt like paradise.
By late afternoon, Jay was organizing files when Leo appeared, perching casually on the edge of his desk.
"How's the first month treating you?"
"Very well. Better than I expected, honestly."
"Good to hear. Ian mentioned you're fitting in nicely."
Jay felt another flutter of excitement. Ian had discussed his performance with Leo. Positively, apparently.
"Everyone's been helpful. Especially Luc with the procedural questions."
"Luc's good people. So are you settling into the office? Finding your place with the team?"
"I think so. Still learning, but yes."
Leo chatted for a few more minutes about Jay's workload and comfort level, then wandered off toward Ian's office. After Leo departed, Jay realized he rarely saw him in the office during regular hours. Leo's appearances seemed sporadic, almost social. The contrast with everyone else's structured schedules struck him as odd.
When Luc passed by later, Jay seized the opportunity for clarification. "Can I ask you about Leo?"
"Sure."
"Is he here regularly? I don't see him most days."
Luc glanced around to ensure privacy, then lowered his tone. "Leo's situation is unique. His father owns the company, so Leo has a position but not traditional responsibilities. He consults on special projects, handles client relationships, but he's not a regular employee like the rest of us."
"I knew about his background, but I never considered the implications."
"Leo doesn't make a big deal of it. He's not pretentious about the family connection. But yeah, he's basically company royalty."
"Does he have a lot of influence here?"
"Absolutely. Ian respects his judgment, and ultimately Leo has his father's ear on major decisions."
Jay thought about Leo's relaxed demeanor, his friendly check-ins, the way he'd casually offered Jay this position. The equality Jay had assumed between them was an illusion. Leo was essentially a king in this environment, choosing to be approachable.
"Thanks for explaining that."
"No problem. Leo's good about not pulling rank, but it's useful to understand the actual hierarchy."
Jay gained new perspective on his place in the office ecosystem. Leo's interest in his welfare wasn't just collegial friendship but something closer to noblesse oblige. The realization didn't diminish his gratitude, but it added complexity to their interactions.
As the day ended, Jay thought back on the month that had passed. He'd found stability,  meaningful work and competent leadership. The team functioned smoothly, supporting each other without drama or politics.
Jay had spent years imagining what it would be like to truly enjoy his job. This was better than his projections—not just the absence of problems, but quality in every aspect of the work environment.
His admiration for Ian had only deepened with this understanding. Creating and maintaining this kind of workplace culture required skill and commitment to the people under your supervision. Ian managed to be demanding without being unreasonable. Jay felt like he belonged somewhere worth belonging to.
Scene 5
Compensation
Expand savings fragment
Jay was reviewing the day's schedule when his phone buzzed with a bank notification. Monthly salary transfer complete. He glanced at the screen, then stared at the direct deposit notification, certain he was misreading the numbers. He opened his banking app to confirm the amount, then closed it and opened it again. The figure remained unchanged.
The base salary was exactly what his contract had specified—nearly double his previous income. But the total deposit was almost triple his old paycheck. A bonus had been added to his monthly pay, far exceeding the modest additional compensation he'd half-expected.
He found Luc in the break room, refilling his coffee cup.
"Can I ask you something?" Jay kept his tone low. "About the paycheck structure?"
"Sure. What's up?"
"The bonus amount. Is this typical?"
Luc smiled. "First month, right? Yeah, we get monthly bonuses as standard. Then quarterly bonuses if the fund performs well, which it normally does."
"Every month?"
"Every month. Part of the compensation package. Didn't Leo explain that during your interview?"
"He mentioned bonuses were possible. I didn't realize they were guaranteed."
"Welcome to working somewhere that values talent properly." Luc raised his coffee cup in a mock toast. "Beats scrambling for overtime pay, doesn't it?"
During lunch, he excused himself early from the restaurant. "Need to handle some personal business," he explained, which was technically true. He spent the rest of his lunch break running calculations on his phone. Rent, utilities, groceries, transportation, expenses that had consumed his previous salary, now represented a fraction of his income. His old job had required budgeting for every purchase. This paycheck eliminated financial anxiety entirely.
He could afford to indulge without calculating the weekly impact. The artisanal sandwiches, the sushi place around the corner, the Mediterranean restaurant the team frequented—all of these became reasonable options.
That afternoon, Jay walked to Café Lemon, a fancy coffee shop close to his apartment. He'd discovered it during his first month of living in the area, drawn by the rich aroma of their house-roasted beans and the warm atmosphere created by mismatched vintage furniture. For years, he'd allowed himself at most two cappuccinos per month, savoring it like a small celebration.
He'd stopped coming a month ago when work lunches began consuming too much of his budget. The barista recognized him despite his absence.
"Haven't seen you in ages," she from behind the espresso machine. "The usual?"
"Please. And one of those almond croissants."
The pastry cost more than he’d previously been willing to spend, but the uneasiness that would have accompanied such a purchase was absent. He could afford this small pleasure without sacrificing necessities elsewhere.
Jay sat at his favorite table, the same spot where he'd filled out job applications after his first position ended badly. The cappuccino tasted exactly as he remembered, with the perfect balance of espresso and steamed milk.
The croissant was a revelation. Buttery layers dissolved on his tongue, the almond filling sweet but not cloying. He ate slowly, savoring both the flavor and the absence of guilt about the expense. Jay had forgotten how much he enjoyed this small comfort—the good coffee, the atmosphere, the brief escape from reality. For twenty minutes, he felt completely relaxed.
But even as he enjoyed the moment, practical considerations tempered his mood. His trial period lasted three months. Despite his positive performance reviews, nothing was guaranteed.  The generous compensation meant nothing if he couldn't maintain his position.
Back in his apartment, Jay transferred a big portion of his paycheck to his emergency savings account. The amount was larger than his entire previous monthly salary, but caution demanded preparation for potential unemployment. He'd learned not to assume job security, regardless of how well things appeared to be going. 
His emergency savings were meagre by some standards, just enough to cover three months of basic expenses, but he always made sure to keep it at that level, no matter what sacrifices he had to make. He couldn't be careless in this regard, and now, seeing the balance, it actually looked reassuring.
Still, enough remained in his checking account to get him through the next month with plenty left over. The relief was profound.
He thought about calling his mother to share the news, then decided against it. Their conversations had dwindled to obligatory exchanges on birthdays and holidays. She had her hands full with his stepfather and half-siblings, her new life in the house where Jay had never quite belonged. His small victories would seem insignificant compared to her daily concerns about mortgage payments and school events.
Besides, what would he say? That he'd found a job that paid well? That he was finally stable? The distance between them wasn't just geographic—it was the accumulated weight of years of growing apart, of accepting that some relationships couldn't survive the changes that time brought. His small town origins felt far removed from his current reality. The gap between his old life and new one was widening, and he wasn't sure he wanted to bridge it.
Jay opened his laptop and reviewed his calendar for the coming month. Client meetings, project deadlines, team collaborations. The work continued to challenge him, but his confidence had grown. Ian's recent praise had confirmed that his efforts were producing results.
One month complete. Two months remaining in his trial period.
He'd shown he could handle the daily responsibilities. Now he needed to demonstrate that his value to the company extended beyond basic competence. The generous compensation wasn't charity—it was an investment that expected returns.
Jay closed the laptop and prepared for bed, his mind already focused on tomorrow's assignments. The financial security was wonderful, but it was also a reminder of what he stood to lose if he became complacent.
He'd worked too hard to reach this point to risk it through overconfidence or relaxation of standards. The second month would be about building on the foundation he'd established, about proving that his first month's performance wasn't a temporary surge but a sustainable level of contribution.
Chapter 4: The ripples
Scene 1
Evaluation
Ian closed the file he was working on and took a moment to reflect. A month of working with Jay Hall had passed without issues. Jay did good work and drew no complaints from clients or colleagues. By any objective measure, the hire had been successful.
Jay arrived at seven-thirty each morning, prepared his workspace and dove into assignments without requiring supervision. His emails were well-crafted, his research accurate, his client interactions informative. He demonstrated analytical thinking, reading between the lines of client communications.
His awkwardness was obvious but harmless. He stumbled over words during meetings and turned pink when praised. He showed consistent deference and never presumed familiarity.
Distance was exactly what he'd intended to maintain. Jay had accepted the dynamic without question and even seemed content with their formal interactions. He made no attempts at personal conversation. Ian should have found this reassuring.
Instead, this very compliance unsettled Ian more than overt advances would have. He knew manipulation came in many forms. Patience could be strategy. The most effective predators understood the value of establishing trust before striking.
Ian was honest enough with himself to acknowledge the deeper problem: his attraction to Jay was undeniable. Those enormous gray eyes that looked at him with such obvious admiration triggered responses he'd spent years learning to suppress.
Physical attraction was manageable. Ian had learned to compartmentalize such responses, to acknowledge them privately while maintaining proper behaviour. He'd worked with attractive people before without difficulty.
But this was more complex. Ian respected Jay's work ethic, his dedication, his desire to learn and improve. The young man approached assignments with zeal that impressed veteran colleagues. He asked intelligent questions and accepted feedback gracefully. These qualities were alluring independent of physical appeal.
That combination—attraction and respect—was precisely what had destroyed Ian's career trajectory years ago. Sam Connelly had been both beautiful and brilliant, had demonstrated excellence that broke down Ian's defences. The memory of that catastrophic misjudgement remained vivid: the rationalization of inappropriate feelings, the spectacular consequences of trusting the wrong person.
Ian straightened in his chair as Leo appeared in his doorway.
"Afternoon check-in with the Ice King," Leo announced, sitting on the chair across from Ian's desk.
"Don't you have actual work to do?"
"I'm conducting important morale assessments." Leo's grin was unrepentant. "Speaking of which, how's the new assistant working out?"
"Adequately."
"He seems harmless, you know. Not everyone who works for you is running a secret agenda."
"Caution is appropriate."
"Paranoia might be more accurate. I've watched you build these walls higher every year. At some point, you have to trust somebody."
"I trust people who've earned it over time."
"And how much time is sufficient? Five years? Ten? Amy's been here almost a decade and you still maintain formal distance."
Ian didn't respond to the observation. Leo pulled a folder from his briefcase and placed it on the desk.
"Background check on Jay Hall. Professionally conducted, thoroughly documented. It’s as comprehensive as they come."
Ian opened the file and scanned the contents. Education records, employment history, credit report, criminal background check—all exactly as Jay had represented during his interview. No red flags, no inconsistencies, no cause for concern.
"Clean as a whistle," Leo said. "Everything checks out. Grew up in a small town, attended state university, worked for a consulting firm until recently. No financial problems, no legal issues, no questionable associations."
"Background checks only reveal documented problems."
"Ian. What exactly would convince you that someone isn't a threat? Because from where I sit, you've created an impossible standard. No one could meet requirements that change retroactively based on your anxiety."
Ian closed the file. "Experience has taught me that initial impressions can be deceiving."
"Experience has taught you to see enemies where none exist. I’m not trying to push you. I just worry you’ll end up making things harder on yourself.” 
Leo stayed a moment longer, as if weighing whether to add something else, then got up and straightened his jacket. “All right. I’ll let you get back to it.”
After Leo departed, Ian remained at his desk, reviewing not just Jay's performance but his own observations of other hires over the years. Turner & Associates attracted ambitious people, many of whom viewed proximity to senior management as an opportunity for advancement. Some had been obvious in their calculations—staying late to be noticed, volunteering for high-profile assignments.
Others had been more subtle. They'd demonstrated competence while slowly introducing personal elements into workplace interactions. A question about weekend plans here, a comment about shared experiences there, the gradual erosion of formal lines under the guise of developing working relationships.
Jay fit neither pattern. His behaviour was consistently withdrawn, almost shy. He completed assignments without seeking additional visibility and accepted praise without leveraging it for greater access. During team drinks, according to Luc's report, he'd been polite but reserved, leaving early with suitable excuses.
This very absence of calculation struck Ian as potentially more sophisticated than previous attempts. Jay's modesty could represent the most patient approach yet. Someone truly committed to a long-term strategy would understand the value of appearing harmless while positioning themselves for eventual exploitation.
A month was nothing in such calculations. If Jay was running a con, he was still in the foundation-building phase, establishing credibility, demonstrating reliability, earning the trust that would eventually be betrayed. The real test would come later, when he felt secure enough to begin exploring whether his target might be vulnerable to approach.
Ian had survived Sam's betrayal by learning never to underestimate anyone's capacity for deception. The stakes were too high—his career, his reputation, his rebuilt life—to gamble on assumptions about someone's character based on surface behaviour.
Ian opened his calendar and noted the date. Jay's three-month probationary period would end at the beginning of November. And Ian would maintain his vigilance. He would observe without seeming to watch and evaluate every interaction. He wouldn't compromise his life for a pair of gray eyes and an earnest smile.
Scene 2
Misstep
Jay knocked on Ian's office door with a finished report folder in his hands. He’d spent two full afternoons at home researching the comparative analysis Ian had requested, determined to make sure everything was perfect. The work had been challenging, more complex than his standard assignments, but he'd felt engaged with the material.
"Come in."
Ian looked up from his computer as Jay approached the desk. "The Greenwell Industries analysis?"
"Yes. I've included the five-year performance comparisons you requested, plus additional context on market conditions during each period."
Ian opened the folder and scanned the first page. His expression remained unreadable as he flipped through the documentation. "This looks comprehensive. Walk me through your methodology for the valuation adjustments."
Jay explained his approach, referencing specific sections of the report. Ian asked clarifying questions, probed his reasoning on certain calculations, tested his understanding of the underlying principles. The discussion felt productive, a substantive work conversation Jay had hoped to have more often.
Encouraged by Ian's engagement with his analysis, Jay ventured beyond the immediate assignment. "I noticed the Greenwell situation has similarities to the Falconridge Enterprises acquisition you handled in the past. The debt restructuring approach was very bold—was that driven primarily by regulatory considerations, or were there strategic advantages I'm not seeing?"
Ian's demeanour changed instantly. His posture stiffened and his eyes grew cold. The temperature in the room seemed to drop ten degrees.
"That's outside your current scope," Ian said, his tone sharp enough to cut. "Focus on your assigned projects."
Jay felt heat flood his face. "Of course. I apologize."
"The report is acceptable. You can go."
Jay retreated from the office, his heart hammering with embarrassment. He'd overstepped badly, had presumed an intimacy with Ian's work that clearly didn't exist. The dismissal had been outwardly polite, but curt enough to make the message absolutely clear. Outside your current scope. Focus on your assigned projects. 
A thinly veiled way of telling someone to stay in their lane and not presume to understand work beyond their level. Jay had allowed the supportive office atmosphere to make him forget the fundamental reality of his situation.
At his desk, Jay tried to return to his tasks, but concentrating was impossible. He replayed the conversation obsessively. The moment when interest had turnef into ice-cold rejection played on repeat in his mind.
He'd grown overconfident. The team's inclusiveness and Ian's recent acknowledgement of his good work had created a false sense of his position in the hierarchy. He was an assistant, barely a month into his probationary period, and he'd had the audacity to question strategic decisions made at levels far above his clearance.
The rest of the afternoon crawled by. When colleagues stopped by his desk for casual conversation, he kept his responses brief and work-focused. The camaraderie he'd begun to enjoy suddenly felt dangerous.
The next morning brought renewed determination to avoid similar mistakes. Jay arrived early and threw himself into assigned tasks. When Ian requested revisions to a client summary, Jay completed them without asking for clarification on borderline issues. When Amy mentioned a complex derivatives transaction, Jay listened politely but asked no follow-up questions.
During their morning briefing, Ian's manner seemed overly formal. His feedback on the due diligence report was delivered perfunctorily. Jay accepted each suggestion, avoiding any response that might seem presumptuous.
"Any questions about these revisions?" Ian asked after explaining the final changes.
Jay had several questions about the reasoning behind certain adjustments, but he suppressed them. "No, everything's clear."
"Good. Have the updated version ready by noon."
The conversation ended there. Ian returned to his computer, and Jay understood the dismissal.
Over the following days, Jay noticed Ian's behaviour had become even less available. Their interactions, always formal, turned positively glacial. Ian's responses to Jay's questions were curt, his acknowledgements of completed work cursory. The courtesy remained, but any hint of warmth had vanished.
Jay watched Ian's interactions with other team members, searching for signs that the change was general. But Ian's manner with Amy, Luc, and the others remained unchanged. He still paused to praise good work, still engaged in brief strategic discussions during team meetings. The difference was reserved for Jay alone.
Jay began second-guessing every word before he spoke. He prepared extensive notes for their brief meetings, rehearsing his comments to ensure he didn’t overstep. He stopped asking follow-up questions, even when confusion arose. Better to research answers independently than risk another humiliating rebuke.
The confidence he'd built over his first month eroded. He'd forgotten his place. Ian had made it clear that Jay was valued for his administrative competence, nothing more. Strategic thinking, curiosity about broader business decisions, intellectual engagement with complex problems—all of that lay beyond his station.
When he started this job, he’d promised himself he would stay unobtrusive, invisible. That was what he should have done all along, and what he intended to do from now on.
Luc noticed the change during a coffee break. "You've been quiet lately. Everything alright?"
"Fine. Just focused on work."
"Focused is good, but you seem tense."
Jay shrugged, unwilling to discuss his mistake. "Learning curve, I suppose."
"It gets easier. First few months are always the hardest."
Jay nodded, but privately wondered if he'd damaged something that couldn't be repaired. Ian's trust, once lost, might not return. The opportunity he'd been so grateful for could disappear if he continued making errors in judgement.
In the evenings, Jay sat in his apartment reviewing the day's interactions, searching for any sign that his probationary status might be in jeopardy. Ian's coldness could be temporary—a way of reinforcing the lines between them, and not a prelude to termination. But Jay couldn't be certain, and uncertainty felt corrosive.
He resolved to be more aware of his limitations. The work itself was still the best he ever had. He'd focus on those positives and remember his place. Ian was his supervisor, not his mentor. The sooner Jay internalized that distinction, the better their working relationship would be.
Meanwhile, in his office, Ian reviewed Jay's personnel file for the third time that week. The young man's question about the Falconridge Enterprises acquisition had been innocent enough on the surface—a logical connection based on legitimate business similarities. But it had probed into sensitive territory, into decisions that involved confidential client information and strategic considerations well above Jay's clearance level.
Sam had begun the same way. Casual curiosity about cases outside his purview. Ian had dismissed the pattern then as natural intellectual growth. He wouldn't make that mistake again.
Jay's recent withdrawal might be appropriate response to correction, or it might be calculated recalibration. Time would reveal which interpretation was accurate. 
Scene 3
Accepting his fate
The following week passed quietly. Jay arrived at his desk each morning in the same manner he had cultivated during his first month, but where once he had participated in the casual conversations that drifted between cubicles, now he offered only polite acknowledgements. When Luc made jokes during the lunch hour, Jay smiled but contributed nothing. When Ela shared newest gossip, he listened without comment.
"You've gone monastery on us," Kim observed on Wednesday, swiveling his chair to face Jay's workstation. "What happened to all those questions you used to ask?"
"I'm still learning," Jay replied, not looking up from his screen. "Just trying to focus more."
Kim waited for elaboration that never came, then returned to his monitors with a slight frown.
Jay had decided that his previous enthusiasm had been misplaced. The questions, the eagerness to understand complex strategies, the hopeful glances toward Ian's office—all of it had been inappropriate. He was administrative support, not an analyst. His role was to facilitate the work of others, not to insert himself into discussions that belonged to people with actual expertise. He had been playing a part he wasn't qualified for, and everyone had been too polite to correct him directly.
Ian's increasing coldness made perfect sense now. Of course the CFO had no interest in explaining acquisition strategies to someone hired to manage calendars and proofread documents.
On Thursday afternoon, Amy approached his desk with her laptop clutched against her chest. Dark circles shadowed her eyes, and her perfect posture had developed a slight slump.
"Jay, I need a huge favour," she said, dropping her laptop beside his keyboard. "This reconciliation report has to be perfect by tomorrow morning, but the numbers aren't adding up. I've been staring at it for hours and I can't find where the error is."
Jay examined the spreadsheet. Rows of figures stretched across dozens of pages, referencing multiple data sources. Work requiring infinite patience.
"I can take a look. How urgent is it?"
"Emergency urgent. The client presentation is first thing Friday, and if these numbers are wrong..." Amy rubbed her temples. "Max would normally handle this, but he's still out, and I'm drowning in the portfolio analyses."
"I'll find the problem," Jay promised.
Amy squeezed his shoulder gratefully. "You're a lifesaver. I owe you dinner."
Jay began working through the spreadsheet systematically, checking each calculation against its source documents. The numbers blurred together after the first hour, but he continued, marking each verified entry with a checkmark. Around him, the office gradually emptied. Luc stopped by his desk at six-thirty.
"Still here?"
"Just finishing something for Amy," Jay replied without looking up.
"Want me to wait? We could grab drinks."
"Thanks, but I'm good. Have a good evening."
Luc hesitated, then collected his jacket and left. By seven o'clock, only Jay and Ian remained on the floor. Jay could see Ian through the glass walls of his office, still working at his computer, but they didn't acknowledge each other beyond the brief nods they had exchanged earlier.
At nine-thirty, he found it, buried in a column of seemingly identical entries. A decimal point had been moved, creating a cascade of incorrect calculations throughout the dependent formulas. Jay corrected the cell and watched as the spreadsheet recalculated itself, numbers shifting into alignment. He ran the reconciliation again, checking and double-checking his work until he was certain the errors had been eliminated. Then he compiled a clean version of the report and sent it to the team with a brief note explaining what he had found and how he had fixed it.
The office was empty by the time he finished. Ian had left about an hour earlier, offering only a perfunctory farewell and no comment on Jay staying late. Jay gathered his things and walked to the elevator. He had done exactly what was asked of him, nothing more and nothing less. Tomorrow, the client would receive accurate data, and the firm would maintain its reputation for reliability.
The next morning Amy sent a brief email to the entire team: "Thanks to Jay Hall for staying late to fix the reconciliation report and catching the error that would have caused serious problems with the Broadmarsh account. Good work."
Jay read the message twice, warmth spreading through his stomach. Recognition felt good, even for work he considered basic responsibility. But the satisfaction faded quickly, replaced by self-doubt. Had he really done something noteworthy, or was Amy simply being kind? The error had been obvious once he found it. Anyone with basic spreadsheet skills could have made the same corrections.
He glanced toward Ian's office. He was deep in conversation with someone on the phone, his back turned to the main floor. Jay wondered if Ian had seen Amy's email, if he disapproved of Jay staying late without authorization.
"Nice work last night," Ela said, appearing beside his desk with her morning coffee. "Amy was panicking about that presentation."
"It wasn't difficult. Just time-consuming."
"Still. Not everyone would have stayed that late for someone else's project."
Jay forced a smile. "Happy to help."
The praise continued throughout the morning. Luc mentioned the email during lunch, Kim nodded approvingly when he passed Jay's desk, even Zoe offered a compliment. Each acknowledgement should have felt validating, but instead Jay grew more uncomfortable. The attention felt undeserved. He had simply done what anyone in his position should do—support the people doing the real work.
He spent the rest of the day organizing filing systems and updating contact databases. Work that required no expertise and created no opportunities for overreach. When someone needed documents copied, he volunteered immediately. When the printer jammed, he fixed it without being asked. When the conference room needed cleaning between client meetings, he handled it.
This was his proper role. Not the eager participant he had tried to be during his first weeks, not the aspiring analyst who asked too many questions. Just the person who made sure everything ran smoothly so others could focus on important work.
Ian had given him this opportunity–protection from the chaos and predatory behaviour that had defined his previous jobs, a chance to exist without fear. That was already more generosity than Jay had any right to expect. To want more, to hope for mentorship or advancement or even basic collegiality, would be presumptuous and ungrateful.
He glanced once more toward Ian's office. Ian's distant professionalism wasn't disapproval, Jay told himself. It was appropriate. A kindness, really. Ian understood that Jay belonged in the background, and he respected that reality instead of offering false encouragement.
Jay returned to his filing with renewed determination. He would prove himself worthy of this gift by asking for nothing more than what he had already received. In a world where powerful people routinely abused their positions, Ian had created a space where Jay could work safely and contribute meaningfully, even if that contribution remained largely invisible. 
Scene 4
Painful returns
There was a noticeable change in the office that Monday in late September, a liveliness that set it apart from most mornings. The elevator buzzed with conversation, colleagues clustered around the coffee station longer than usual.
"Max is back," Ela announced as she hung her jacket in the small closet. "Finally. I thought we were going to collapse under the workload."
Jay had heard the name mentioned countless times over the past month—Max Goodwin, senior analyst, the absent team member whose projects had been distributed among the remaining staff, and whose return date kept getting pushed back. From the way people spoke about him, Jay had imagined someone intimidating, a financial genius whose shoes no one could properly fill. The reality was entirely different.
Max exploded into the office at nine-fifteen, his laughter preceding him down the hallway. He was shorter than Jay had expected, stocky and sun-weathered, with graying hair and booming voice.
"This place looks like a morgue," he announced, dropping a oversized duffel bag beside Amy's desk. "What happened to the music I used to hear? Where's the energy?"
Amy stood to embrace him. "We've been drowning without you. The workload has been insane, and we've been splitting your portfolio between three people."
"If you hadn’t come back in time for the quarterly reports, we’d have been doomed," Ela added.
"Well, I'm back now. The island was incredible, but getting trapped there was a nightmare. Thought I'd never see you again." Max's eyes swept the office, cataloging faces. "Everyone looks exhausted. We need to fix that immediately."
Jay watched from his desk as Max worked his way through the team, dispensing hugs, backslaps, and rapid-fire questions about projects he'd left behind. People stood straighter, spoke louder, smiled more readily. Even Ian emerged from his office, and Jay witnessed something he had never seen before—Ian's face softening into what could almost be called warmth.
"Max," Ian said, extending his hand. "Good to have you back."
"Ian, you look terrible. Have you been sleeping?" Max gripped Ian's hand in both of his own. "I leave for two months and everyone falls apart. This is why I can never retire."
"The office hasn't been the same," Ian replied.
Max's attention eventually turned to the periphery, where Jay sat quietly organizing the morning's correspondence. "Hold on. Who's this?"
Jay's fingers stilled on his keyboard. Every head in the office turned toward him, and he felt his face begin to burn.
"That's Jay," Amy said. "Jay Hall. He's been helping us with administrative support."
Max strode over, his hand already extended. "Jay Hall! So you're Leo's new joke hire! Welcome to the team!"
The words hit Jay like cold water. The office fell silent—not the comfortable quiet of people returning to work, but the sharp silence of witnesses to something awkward. Jay shook Max's offered hand while his mind reeled.
"Thank you," he managed, his voice barely audible.
Max seemed oblivious to the tension he had created. "Leo's got a type, I'll give him that. But don't worry—if you've lasted this long, you must be doing something right. Most of his joke hires don't make it past the first month."
Jay's smile felt like it might crack his face. Around him, he could sense his colleagues' discomfort—Kim studying his computer screen intently, Ela suddenly finding her coffee fascinating, Amy's face tight with something that might have been sympathy or embarrassment.
"I should get back to work," Jay said, sinking into his chair.
"Of course, of course. We'll catch up properly later." Max clapped him on the shoulder with enough force to make Jay wince, then moved on to demand updates on the quarterly projections.
The rest of the morning passed in a haze. Jay processed emails, answered phone calls, and maintained a helpful demeanour, but Max's words echoed in his mind. Joke hire.
What did that mean? And why did everyone seem to know something he didn't?
Just before lunch, Luc appeared beside the printer where Jay was copying a stack of client reports. Luc glanced around the empty corridor, then moved closer.
"Hey. Don't let Max get to you. He's got no filter, especially when he's excited."
Jay fed another document into the machine, not trusting himself to speak.
"Look, I probably shouldn't tell you this, but..." Luc hesitated, then continued in an even lower voice. "I was a joke hire once, too. Leo has this thing—he likes to mess with people sometimes. It's not malicious, just... stupid rich boy games."
"What kind of games?" Jay asked, though he wasn't sure he wanted to know.
"It's complicated. Leo and Ian have this history, this dynamic. Sometimes Leo brings in people to... I don't know. Stir things up? Make some kind of point?" 
"Are you saying I was hired as a joke?"
"No. No, that's not—" Luc looked frustrated. "You were hired because we needed administrative support. But there might have been other motivations."
Jay stared at the printer, watching it slowly process each page. "What other motivations?"
"There was this scandal… Look, it doesn't matter. You work hard, Jay. Everyone sees that. Whatever Leo's reasons were for bringing you in, you've earned your place here through your own effort."
Luc's words should have been comforting, but they only raised more questions. What history did Leo and Ian share? And what did any of it have to do with Jay?
That evening, Jay sat in his apartment with his laptop open, staring at the search results for "Ian Hagen scandal." The articles were old, dating back several years, but the tabloid headlines were brutal: "Hagen's Office Romance Turns Ugly," "Corporate Spy Seduces A Heir." Jay clicked through them with growing horror, piecing together the story of Ian's relationship with a secretary, the corporate espionage that had nearly destroyed Ian's career, and the public humiliation that had followed.
But it was the newer articles that made Jay's stomach drop. Gossip pieces speculating about Ian's hiring practices, ugly insinuations about his preferences for attractive assistants.
The laptop screen blurred as Jay stared at the words. Was this what people saw when they looked at him? Was this what Max had meant by "Leo's got a type"? Was he nothing more than the latest in a series of pretty boys hired to amuse the wealthy and powerful?
The apartment felt too small, the walls pressing in on him. Jay walked to his window and looked out at the city lights, trying to make sense of what he had learned. Everything felt different now—every interaction, every kindness, every moment of courtesy. Had it all been part of some elaborate game?
But even as the betrayal cut through him, one thing remained stubbornly clear. Ian had never made him feel uncomfortable. Even at his coldest, Ian had treated Jay with respect and professionalism.
Jay returned to his laptop and read the articles again, more carefully this time. The scandal had been devastating. If Ian was now wary of relationships with subordinates, if he maintained distance from his staff, that made sense. It was self-protection.
And if Leo Turner was playing some kind of game with people's lives, using Jay as a pawn in whatever twisted dynamic he shared with Ian, then Jay was caught in the middle of something he didn't understand and couldn't control. But what could he do? Quit? Confront Leo? Demand answers from Ian?
Jay closed the laptop and sat in darkness. The safe harbour he thought he had found suddenly felt precarious and false. But where else could he go? Back to jobs where bosses saw him as prey? Back to the uncertainty and fear that had defined his working life?
He thought about Amy's smile when he had fixed her spreadsheet. Luc's friendship. Whatever games were being played at higher levels, his relationships with his colleagues felt real.
And Ian had given him something Jay had never experienced before: the feeling of safety, a workplace free from harassment, an environment where he could focus on work instead of fending off unwanted attention.
Even if it was all a lie, even if he was nothing more than entertainment for people who saw him as disposable, Jay wasn't sure he could give up the only security he had ever known.
Scene 5
Resignation
Tuesday morning was gray and unremarkable. Jay sat at his desk by seven-thirty, way before anyone else typically appeared. The office held a cathedral quiet that he had come to prefer—no conversations, no comments that might hold hidden meanings.
He opened the email and began sorting through the messages. Client requests, meeting confirmations, document revisions. Each task received the same attention, processed and completed without flourish or delay. The work filled the space where thoughts might otherwise intrude.
When his colleagues began filtering in around eight, Jay acknowledged their greetings with polite nods but offered nothing more. The morning pleasantries that had once felt welcoming now seemed like potential traps. Every interaction held the possibility of revealing how much he knew, how deeply the truth had cut.
"Morning, Jay. How was your evening?" Amy said.
"Fine, thank you."
She waited for elaboration that never came, then turned to her computer with a slight frown. Jay had noticed the pattern developing over the past week—people expected more from him, seemed surprised by his brevity, but no one pressed for details.
Max's booming laughter echoed from the conference room where he was catching up with Ian on the projects that had accumulated during his absence. The sound made Jay's shoulders tighten. He focused harder on the spreadsheet in front of him, double-checking figures that were already correct.
At ten-thirty, Luc approached his desk with a stack of documents that needed copying and binding for an afternoon presentation. "These need to be collated and spiral-bound."
"I'll have them ready by noon," Jay replied without looking up.
Luc hesitated. "You okay? You've been pretty quiet lately."
"I'm fine. Just focused on work."
"Right. Well, let me know if you need anything."
Jay nodded, already reaching for the papers. He walked to the copy room with purposeful steps, thankful for a task that required no human interaction. The machine's rhythmic churning provided white noise against the questions that constantly circled in his mind.
Why had Leo Turner hired him? What entertainment value did Jay provide for people who could afford to treat other human beings as amusing diversions? Was Ian complicit, or was he simply another victim of Leo's games?
The questions led nowhere productive, so Jay pushed them aside and focused on collating pages in the correct order. This was what mattered—the immediate task, the concrete requirement, the measurable result. Everything else was speculation and self-pity.
When he returned to his desk, Kim was troubleshooting a network connection issue that had affected three workstations. Jay set the bound documents on Luc's desk and returned to his own work without offering assistance. He had learned to recognize which problems required his help and which were beyond his capabilities. Network issues belonged to Kim's expertise.
Jay joined the team for lunch, slipping into the background. Back at his desk, he focused on reviewing the afternoon's calendar, noting which meetings would require conference room setup, which clients needed specific documentation prepared, which deadlines loomed closest. The mundane nature of the planning soothed him. No ambiguity, no hidden agendas, no need to guess at motivations.
Ela stopped by his desk on her way to a meeting. "Jay, I'm expecting a call around three. If it comes in while I'm in the presentation, can you take a message?"
"Of course."
"Thanks. You're a lifesaver."
The casual phrase made something twist in Jay's stomach. Lifesaver. Helper. Reliable support. All accurate descriptions, all appropriate for his role. But they all felt fake now. In that moment, he recognized his own replies as lines in a play he hadn’t even known he was performing.
He pushed the thought away and returned to his work. He couldn't afford these feelings. The job was great and safe. That was more than he had found anywhere else, and probably more than he would find again.
The afternoon crawled by. Documents were proofread, phone calls logged, appointments confirmed, files organized. Each accomplishment felt insignificant but necessary. Jay moved through his responsibilities like someone checking items off a shopping list, completely emotionally detached.
At five o'clock, most of the team began gathering their things and shutting down computers. As they prepared to leave, there was grumbling about the looming quarterly reports and talk of going to bed early to catch up on sleep before the workload peaked.
Jay remained at his desk, finishing a client database update that could easily wait until tomorrow. The extra work served no purpose beyond keeping him occupied, preventing the moment when he would have to return to his apartment and sit alone with his thoughts.
"You don't have to stay late," Amy said, gathering her purse and jacket. "The work will still be here tomorrow."
"Just finishing up," Jay replied without looking at her.
She paused by his desk. "Jay, is everything all right? You've seemed... quieter lately."
"I'm fine. Thank you for asking."
Amy looked at him for a moment, then nodded. "Have a good evening."
Jay waited until the office emptied before finally shutting down his computer. The elevator ride to the ground floor felt longer than usual, the mirrored walls reflecting his image from multiple angles. He avoided looking directly at his reflection, keeping his eyes fixed on the floor numbers as they descended.
The evening commute passed quickly. Jay found a seat by the window, letting the motion and noise wash over him without really registering either. His mind felt deliberately blank, a defense mechanism he had cultivated over the past week.
His apartment met him with silence, the kind that seemed to press in on him. Jay reheated dinner, ate it at the table, then sat at his couch with a stack of bills that needed organizing. The mundane task filled another hour, another stretch of time that didn't require self-reflection. He moved through the rest of his evening without thinking and went to bed early.
The next day, he returned to an office as tense as he felt. With September ending, the quarterly reports had begun, when everyone seemed to live in the office on takeout. Not much was expected of him beyond his duties, and he was at least relieved that, in the chaos, no one seemed to pay him any particular attention.
When Jay checked his bank account online later that day, he saw a balance larger than he’d ever had after two paychecks at his new company. The number should have made him happy, evidence of his successful transition to a better job. Instead, it felt like a transaction completed, services rendered and compensated according to their market value.
Jay stared at the screen for a long time, thinking about dignity and compromise, about the prices people paid for security. He had a roof over his head, food in his refrigerator, and work that challenged him. Thousands of people would consider his situation enviable.
If the cost was his self-respect, if the price was accepting his role as entertainment, then perhaps that was simply the nature of the transaction. He had traded his dignity for stability, his pride for a paycheck. The marketplace had determined his worth, and he had accepted the terms.
Jay closed the laptop and prepared for bed, mindlessly moving through the evening. Tomorrow would bring another day of obligations to fulfil. The work would continue regardless of his feelings about it.
In the darkness of his bedroom, he lay still, avoiding the thoughts that wanted to surface. He had made his choice. The only rational response was to live with the consequences and find whatever satisfaction he could in competent performance of his duties.
If it felt like slowly drowning, that was a price he was willing to pay, because even this was better than the alternative. He’d rather be the clown than someone’s prey.
Chapter 5: Finding his place
Scene 1
Glamour
As the first week of October came to a close, the frantic pace of quarterly reports finally began to ease. With the worst behind them, it was time for the next fixture on the company calendar—the quarterly party. 
The invitation to Turner & Associates’ Quarterly Celebration had arrived weeks in advance, printed on heavy cream cardstock with embossed gold lettering. The address was a rooftop venue in one of the city’s most prestigious towers, a place Jay had only ever seen in magazines. As a new employee, Jay had received his invitation along with his starter package, but with so many onboarding materials to go through, he hadn’t paid it proper attention. Only a recent reminder email from HR brought it back to his mind, leaving him with precious little time to prepare.
He'd spent three days researching appropriate attire, another two visiting menswear stores he'd never entered before. The midnight blue suit cost a small fortune, but he'd convinced himself it was a necessary investment. Appearance mattered in this environment, and blending in was essential.
Standing in the elevator ascending to the fifty floor, Jay adjusted his tie for the dozenth time. The suit fit well, but he felt like he was wearing a costume.
The elevator doors opened to reveal a space that belonged in a different world. Crystal chandeliers cast warm light over clusters of perfectly dressed guests. Servers in white jackets circulated with champagne. A jazz quartet played in one corner while a renowned local news anchor served as host.
Jay accepted a glass of champagne and tried to blend into his group. Amy looked stunning in a black cocktail dress, her serious demeanour softened by the elegant setting. Kim had traded his casual office attire for a sharp charcoal suit. Even Zoe, who rarely joined any social gatherings, was present in a flowing burgundy dress, engaged in animated conversation with someone from the accounting team.
"Great turnout this quarter," Luc said, appearing at Jay's elbow. "The fund's performance has everyone in good spirits."
"It's impressive."
"First company party?"
"This elaborate, yes."
"You'll get used to it. Turner & Associates knows how to celebrate success."
Jay struggled with the small talk that flowed around him. The conversation jumped from market analyses to industry gossip, topics that required either expertise he lacked or personal details he was reluctant to share.
"A toast," Amy announced, lifting her champagne flute. "To another successful quarter."
Everyone raised their glasses. Jay fumbled slightly with his, nearly spilling champagne on his expensive suit. "To success," he managed, his voice barely audible above the ambient noise.
As the evening progressed, the formal atmosphere gave way to mingling and networking. Jay watched his colleagues scatter throughout the room, seamlessly joining conversations with senior staff, and occasional clients and partners from other firms. The ease with which they moved through this social landscape highlighted his own awkwardness.
He positioned himself near the windows, hoping to appear contemplative. 
"Jay."
Jay turned to find Ian approaching, champagne glass in hand.
"Good evening, Ian. Beautiful venue."
"The partners chose well."
"The view is remarkable."
"Yes." Ian glanced toward a group of senior staff who were clearly expecting his return. "Enjoy the rest of the evening."
The exchange lasted perhaps fifteen seconds. Courtesy without a trace of warmth. Jay watched Ian walk away, joining a cluster of senior executives who welcomed him with obvious respect.
Throughout the evening, Jay observed Ian's interactions with others. He saw him laugh at something Leo said, offer congratulations to Amy on a recent project, engage in a long conversation with Ela. The contrast with their brief, formal exchange was unmistakable.
Jay told himself this was appropriate. Ian was treating him exactly as he should treat a junior employee at a company function. The distance was proof of Ian's integrity, not a personal slight. But the rationalization couldn't eliminate the sting.
"You look like you're analyzing the molecular structure of champagne," Luc appeared at his elbow. "Everything alright?"
"Fine. Just taking in the atmosphere."
"It's a lot the first time. I spent my first company event hiding in the bathroom."
Jay managed a smile. "That's reassuring."
"You're doing better than you think. These things get easier."
Jay nodded, but privately doubted the claim. He didn't belong in this rarefied environment, among people who moved through high society as if they'd been born to it.
After the night had stretched far enough, Jay made his escape as early as politeness allowed. He thanked the appropriate people, made the necessary excuses about early morning commitments, and slipped away before anyone could propose extending the festivities.
In the elevator descending to street level, Jay caught his reflection in the polished steel doors. The suit looked good on him—he could admit that much. But the man wearing it still looked like he was playing dress-up.
Outside, the city felt different. More real. Jay walked to the metro station, his expensive shoes clicking on the concrete, his jacket a barrier between him and the evening air.
This was his place: invisible, uninvolved, unthreatening. He'd wanted safety, and safety meant accepting limitations. The job was prestigious, the pay was excellent, the work was engaging. Those benefits came with costs, including the recognition that some spaces would always feel foreign to him.
Meanwhile, back at the celebration, Leo cornered Ian near the bar. "Jay looked great tonight. That suit was inspired."
"I hadn't noticed."
"Of course you hadn't. Though I should mention that several people did notice. Sal from risk management spent half the evening trying to engineer an introduction. And I'm pretty sure Jen from accounting was making eyes at him."
"His social interactions are none of my concern."
"No, of course not. But if you're going to fumble this badly, someone else is going to step in. The boy's got that lost romantic hero thing going on. Very appealing to a certain type."
Ian finished his champagne and set the glass on the bar. "There's nothing to fumble. He's an employee, nothing more."
"Right. And that's why you've been watching him all evening while pretending not to."
Ian had been watching, despite himself. He'd noticed Jay's obvious discomfort, the way he'd stood apart from groups, the politeness that couldn't mask his anxiety. The young man had looked beautiful in the midnight blue suit, his pale complexion and dark hair creating a striking contrast against the elegant fabric. He'd also looked completely out of his depth, like someone playing a role he'd never auditioned for.
The protective instinct that arose from that observation was dangerous. Ian recognized it as the same impulse that had blinded him to Sam's true nature—the desire to shelter someone who appeared vulnerable, to offer guidance and support to someone who seemed to need it.
"He's managing fine on his own," Ian said.
"Is he? Because from where I stood, he looked like he was drowning."
"Not my responsibility."
"Maybe not. But it could be your opportunity."
Ian walked away without responding, forcing himself to hold back. He refused to let himself be swayed by how fragile Jay looked, or by the hurt in his expression. Whatever Jay was going through, Ian needed to guard his own heart more than he needed to offer help.
Scene 2
Pity
Ian had prided himself on his powers of observation. Years of analysing market trends, reading client temperaments, and managing corporate politics had honed his ability to notice subtle changes in behaviour. But he had never applied that scrutiny to his own staff with quite the intensity he now directed toward Jay Hall.
The change had been immediate and unmistakable. Where Jay had once been quiet but engaged, he now seemed to exist in a state of cultivated invisibility. His work arrived earlier than before, so carefully executed it was clear he was desperate to avoid any criticism. During team meetings, Jay positioned himself at the edges, contributing only when directly asked.
Most telling was his posture. Jay moved through the office like someone expecting punishment, shoulders slightly hunched, eyes fixed on whatever task occupied his immediate attention. He no longer smiled or asked tentative questions that had once punctuated their interactions. Instead, he responded to Ian's instructions with politeness that felt rehearsed.
Ian watched this change from behind his glass office walls, disturbed by how closely he was monitoring someone he had resolved to keep at a distance. The irony wasn't lost on him—in his determination to avoid the mistakes of his past, he had become hyper-aware of Jay's every movement.
Max's comment had been thoughtless but typical. Leo's hiring practices had always been subject to speculation and innuendo. But Jay's reaction had been unlike anything Ian had expected from someone with hidden motives. There had been no indignation, no attempt to defend himself or curry favor. Just a wounded silence.
For days, Ian wrestled with the implications. If Jay was truly the innocent he appeared to be, then allowing him to suffer under the weight of office gossip seemed needlessly cruel. But any direct intervention risked exposing how closely Ian had been watching, how much mental energy he had devoted to analyzing someone who was supposed to be merely administrative support.
On Thursday afternoon, Ian made his decision.
"Jay," he called from his office doorway. "Could you come in for a moment?"
Jay appeared within seconds, notepad in hand. "Yes?"
"Please, sit." Ian gestured to the chair across from his desk. "I have a new project for you."
Jay sat on the chair with the posture designed to take up minimal space. "Of course. What do you need?"
Ian pulled a thick folder from his desk drawer. "This is a client confidentiality audit for the Stormfront Group account. I need someone to review all documentation from the past eighteen months, cross-reference it with our disclosure protocols, and flag any potential compliance issues."
He watched Jay's face as he explained the scope of the work. The project was important and required discretion, but it was general enough that it didn’t demand extensive insider experience. It was also the sort of task Ian typically handled himself.
"The work is sensitive. Stormfront is one of our largest clients, and any compliance gaps could have serious consequences. I'll need detailed notes on your methodology and findings."
Jay accepted the folder. "When do you need this completed?"
"End of next week. And Jay? If you have questions about the protocols or need clarification on any of the documentation, don't hesitate to ask. This isn't a project you should struggle through alone."
Jay simply nodded. "I understand. Thank you for trusting me with this."
The idea of trust stopped Ian cold. He had to remind himself he wasn’t that naive. Still, his doubts wouldn’t cloud the fairness he aimed to show.
"Your work ethic made you the logical choice. That spreadsheet work you did for Amy last month showed exactly the skills this project requires."
Jay's fingers tightened slightly on the folder. "I'll make sure it's done properly."
"I'm confident you will."
After Jay left his office, Ian stared at the door that closed after him. The interaction had felt different—less guarded on his part, though he couldn't say why. Perhaps because Jay's resignation had been so complete, so lacking in any agenda beyond basic survival, that it had disarmed Ian's suspicions.
Over the following days, Ian glanced toward Jay's desk more frequently than work-related curiosity warranted. Jay worked through the documentation with the same diligence he brought to everything else, but there was something almost meditative about his focus. He spread the papers across his desk in categories, made notes in margins with beautiful handwriting, and periodically consulted the compliance manual Ian had provided.
Twice, Jay approached Ian’s office with questions about the finer points of the assignment—technical details he couldn’t deduce on his own, despite having reviewed the materials multiple times. Each time, he paused at the door, bracing himself for the possibility of a rebuke, even though his questions were perfectly reasonable. Instead, Ian always took the time to answer in full, going beyond a simple explanation of the rules to share the rationale behind each protocol. Jay listened with full attention, though some part of him stayed wary, half-expecting a reprimand.
"The disclosure requirements seem designed to protect the client's privacy while ensuring regulatory compliance," Jay observed during their second consultation. "It's more complex than I initially thought."
"Most people assume compliance work is just bureaucratic box-checking. But done properly, it's about balancing competing interests—transparency, privacy, legal obligations, business relationships."
Jay nodded thoughtfully. "I can see how easy it would be to miss something important if you approached it too perfunctorily."
When Jay submitted the completed audit the following Thursday, Ian set aside his other work to review it immediately. The analysis was well-organized, with clear explanations of methodology and detailed documentation of findings. Jay had identified three minor compliance gaps and his recommendations for addressing them were both practical and legally sound.
But it was the marginal notes that held Ian's attention longest. Jay had included small observations about document organization that indicated he understood not just the technical requirements but the broader business context. The work revealed a mind that could see patterns and connections beyond the immediate task.
Ian read through the report twice, then a third time, searching for... what? Evidence of deception? Signs of hidden agenda? Or simply confirmation that his growing sense of Jay's competence was justified?
Reality was more unsettling than either possibility. He was looking for clues about who Jay really was—not the administrative assistant who processed his correspondence, but the person behind the mask. The person who had been wounded by Max's comment and had responded not with anger but with deeper withdrawal.
Ian closed the folder and leaned back in his chair. He had given Jay an important assignment and received exceptional work in return. The gesture had been intended as a signal, recognition of value, an indication that Jay's contributions were noticed and appreciated. Whether Jay understood the message was another matter entirely.
Through his office wall, Ian could see Jay at his desk, working through the afternoon's tasks with the focus that had become his trademark. There was no indication that the special project had affected his mood or his perspective on his role. If anything, he seemed more withdrawn than before, as if success had only reinforced his determination to remain invisible.
Ian had offered what he could within the confines he had established for himself—meaningful work, respectful treatment. But watching Jay's solitary figure bent over his keyboard, Ian wondered if it was enough, or if some wounds ran too deep for such subtle gestures to heal.
The thought troubled him more than it should have. Jay Hall was an employee, nothing more. His emotional state was relevant only insofar as it affected his work performance. Ian had learned that lesson the hard way, and he had no intention of forgetting it again.
But the hollow look in Jay's eyes haunted him, and Ian hoped that somewhere beneath the resignation, some small part of Jay understood that he was valued for more than his appearance, more than whatever ploy had brought him to Turner & Associates in the first place.
Scene 3
Distrust
The awkwardness between Jay and Ian didn’t vanish, but it was suddenly eclipsed by a new, prestigious acquisition. Hartwell was a major firm, a client most teams only hoped to land once. Ian had brought them in personally, a move that raised eyebrows—he hadn’t handled client acquisition himself in years. That alone signaled the importance of the project, and the office rearranged around it accordingly.
For nearly two weeks, the team threw themselves into the prospect. Jay had watched from the periphery as they worked late into evenings, sensing the difference without fully understanding the stakes. Jay's role had been supporting—organizing documents, coordinating schedules, ensuring that presentations were printed without error. 
Jay's collegues consumed client research over lunches, and turned the office into a war room of financial projections and strategy sessions. Jay wasn’t invited to the meetings behind closed doors, but he could tell when they’d gone badly: Ian would emerge with his jaw tight, the lines at the corners of his eyes deepened.
Once, midway through the afternoon, Ian passed him on the way to the conference room and a faint smell of cigarettes followed him. It startled Jay,  reminding him that even Ian was showing strain.
The day the representatives arrived, the office atmosphere was tense, like the air before a storm. Jay had been asked to stay close, mostly to fetch files or bring in whatever documents Ian might need on short notice. He kept to the side of the conference room, trying not to draw attention. The conversation itself stayed mostly over his head, but even he could sense the undercurrents—moments when Ian’s tone cooled just enough to signal a line being drawn. When the meeting finally ended, the room emptied in silence. Jay hadn’t said a word the entire time. It felt as though he’d witnessed an invisible tug-of-war that left everyone a little drained.
Finally, on a Friday afternoon, the confirmation email arrived: Hartwell would sign with Turner & Associates. The office erupted in a spontaneous celebration. Amy applauded when Ian announced the news. Kim, who had spent a week troubleshooting client database integrations, grinned from ear to ear. Even Zoe emerged from her corner to join the impromptu gathering around Ian's office. 
"Conference room in ten minutes," Ian announced. "I want to debrief while everything's fresh." 
Jay had attended similar meetings before, taking notes and managing logistics while the real participants discussed strategy and lessons learned. He gathered his notepad and pen, prepared to occupy a position along the wall where he could document without intruding. The team sat around the polished conference table. Ian took his place at the head, but his formal demeanour had softened. 
"This was a team effort," Ian began. "Everyone contributed essential work. Amy, your market analysis identified the leverage points that made our proposal compelling. Kim, the technical integration you designed gave us a competitive edge that other firms couldn't match. Max, your relationship management kept Hartwell engaged through some difficult negotiations. Ela, you provided the international perspective that sealed their confidence in our global reach." 
Max leaned back in his chair leisurely. "It was a beautiful pitch. Though I have to say, Jay's pretty face didn't hurt our cause. Hartwell's senior staff definitely perked up when he walked into that presentation room." 
The comment landed heavily. A few people laughed an awkward, uncertain laughter that fills uncomfortable spaces. Jay kept his eyes fixed on his notepad, his pen moving in meaningless loops across the paper. 
"Jay did excellent work on this project," Luc said firmly. "Those client briefing materials were flawless." 
"Absolutely," Amy added. "The timeline coordination alone saved us days of confusion. Every meeting, every deadline, every document—perfectly organized."  
Jay felt warmth spread through his chest despite himself. These comments felt different from Max's brusqueness—specific, focused on actual contributions. For a moment, he allowed himself to believe that his work mattered, that he had earned his place through competence. 
"Jay's contribution has been invaluable. This project required coordination across multiple departments, and nothing fell through the cracks," Ian said.
The praise should have felt unambiguously good. Jay had worked hard, contributed meaningfully, and received recognition from people whose opinions he respected. But Max's comment echoed in his mind, poisoning it with doubt. Was the praise honest, or were his colleagues simply being kind? Did they see him as a valuable team member, or as someone who needed protection from jokes? 
The meeting continued with technical debriefs and process improvements, but Jay couldn't  concentrate. His thoughts oscillated between pride and suspicion, between the warm acknowledgement of his contributions and the cold reality of how others might perceive him. When the meeting concluded, people dispersed cheerfully. Jay packed his notes and prepared to return to his desk, but Luc caught his arm in the hallway. 
"Hey. Don't let Max get in your head. He can be an oaf sometimes. Your work on this project was impressive. Ian doesn't give compliments unless he means them." 
Jay managed a fragile smile. "Thank you. I appreciate that." 
"I'm serious. You've got good instincts for this work. Don't let anyone make you think otherwise." The words were kind, but they raised as many questions as they answered. Why did Luc feel the need to reassure him? How obvious was his uncertainty? And most unsettling of all—was Luc's kindness part of the same dynamic that had brought Jay to Turner & Associates in the first place? 
The rest of the afternoon went by with regular work—filing documents from the Hartwell project, preparing materials for Monday's meetings. The praise from the meeting replayed in Jay's mind alongside Max's objectification. The two perspectives felt irreconcilable, leaving him suspended between hope and cynicism. 
When five arrived, Jay gathered his belongings and joined the evening exodus. The metro ride home gave him time to process the day's events, but instead of clarity, he found only deeper confusion. Had he truly contributed something valuable, or were his colleagues being diplomatic? Was recognition possible for someone in his position, or would everything he accomplished be filtered through the lens of his appearance? 
Jay arrived at his apartment more unsettled than ever. After dinner, he stood before the bathroom mirror, studying his reflection. The face that looked back at him was unremarkable enough—pale skin, gray eyes, features that might charitably be called pleasant. But somehow this ordinary appearance had become the defining factor in how others perceived him, the lens through which all his interactions were interpreted. If he had been born with different features—plainer, more forgettable, less likely to inspire commentary—would his life have followed a different path? Would his first boss have seen him as a capable employee instead of prey? Would Leo Turner have hired him for his skills and not for whatever entertainment value he provided? Would Max see him as a colleague? 
Jay touched his reflection, his fingertips meeting cold glass. These features had never brought him anything but trouble. In school, they had made him a target for bullies. In his previous jobs, they had attracted unwanted attention that ultimately destroyed his sense of safety. Now they served as the foundation for jokes and speculation that undermined his every achievement. 
He thought about the praise he had received during the meeting.  Those comments had felt good in the moment, but doubt crept in anyway. How much of that recognition was real, and how much was simply colleagues being kind to someone they pitied? The question felt unanswerable, and Jay was tired of trying to solve it. 
He turned away from the mirror and prepared for bed. In the darkness of his bedroom, Jay lay still and tried to find joy in the day's accomplishments. But the victories felt bitter, overshadowed by the persistent sense that nothing he achieved would ever be entirely his own. 
Sleep came slowly, filled with dreams of conference rooms where praise turned to laughter, where mirrors showed not his face but the cold eyes of those who would never see him as an equal.
Scene 4
Apology
Repetitive beginning, the change was mentioned before
The days that followed the Hartwell acquisition returned to the previous rhythm while the contract was being finalized by the legal team. Jay performed his duties well, but the eager curiosity that had once characterized his work didn't return. He never lingered over interesting details or asked questions that might deepen his understanding. The enthusiastic student who had once asked questions about acquisition strategies had been replaced by someone who stayed strictly within the confines of his assigned role.
His colleagues noticed the change but seemed uncertain how to address it. Conversations around his desk continued normally, but people no longer expected him to participate beyond basic acknowledgments. The camaraderie that had been developing during his first month never recovered.
"Drinks after work?" Luc asked on Friday, the same invitation he had extended weekly since Jay's arrival. The question had become almost ceremonial—offered without real expectation, declined with predictable courtesy.
"Maybe some other time," Jay replied.
"Sure thing," Luc said, and that was the end of it. No one pressed anymore, no one expressed disappointment. They had learned to accept his polite rejections as final.
Jay told himself this was better. Cleaner. Less complicated than trying to manage social dynamics he didn't fully understand with people who might pity him more than they liked him. Work relationships should be kept on a formal level. But the isolation wore on him.
On Tuesday afternoon, while Jay was collating documents near the copy machine, Max appeared beside him with uncharacteristic hesitation. Instead of his booming confidence, Max whispered, glancing around to ensure they weren't overheard.
"Hey, Jay. Can I talk to you for a minute?"
Jay continued feeding papers into the machine, not looking up. "Of course."
Max fidgeted awkwardly, hands shoved deep in his pockets. "Look, about that whole joke hire thing I said when I got back. I've been thinking about it, and I realize I was an ass. I thought you already knew about Leo's... habits. It was just office nonsense, you know? Doesn't mean anything real."
Jay's hands stilled on the papers. "It's fine. Really."
"No, it's not fine. I made you feel like crap, and that wasn't my intention. Luc was in the same situation when he started—Leo brought him in for ridiculous reasons—and look at him now. He's one of our most valued team members. What matters is the work you do, and honestly? You're doing great work, man."
Jay forced himself to meet Max's eyes, manufacturing a smile. "I appreciate that. But really, no worries. It's all good."
"Is it though? Because I've been told you've been different since then. Quieter. And I can't help thinking that's my fault."
"I'm just focusing on work," Jay said, returning to his collating.
Max reached out and touched his shoulder briefly, the gesture surprisingly gentle from someone so physically exuberant. "Well, for what it's worth, I'm sorry. You didn't deserve that."
"Thanks," Jay said, and he meant it, even though the apology couldn't undo the knowledge that now lived permanently in his mind.
Max lingered for another moment, clearly wanting to say more, then seemed to recognize that he had done what he could. He squeezed Jay's shoulder once and walked away, leaving Jay alone with the copy machine and the weight of good intentions.
At lunch, Jay joined the team at their usual table in the nearby bistro. The invitation had become automatic, and his acceptance equally routine, but the dynamic felt different from his early weeks. He sat at the edge of the conversation, eating his sandwich while others discussed weekend plans.
"Did you see the email about the Marburg account restructuring?" Amy asked the table generally.
"Nightmare waiting to happen," Kim replied. "Their current portfolio allocation makes no sense."
"Could be an opportunity though," Ela added. "If we can demonstrate better performance metrics..."
Jay understood the technical references, could have contributed insights based on the documentation he had processed, but something held him back. Not lack of knowledge, but a bone-deep certainty that his perspective wasn't wanted, that his participation would at best be tolerated.
Luc caught his eye across the table and smiled—an expression of friendship that Jay forced himself to return. But even Luc's kindness felt complicated now, filtered through the knowledge that they shared a history as Leo's joke hires. Was Luc's friendship real, or was it the solidarity of the similarly positioned?
That evening, Jay sat in his apartment at his small dining table with a bowl of reheated curry, replaying the day’s events in his mind. Max's apology had been sincere, his colleagues' continued friendliness appeared honest, and his work performance remained strong. By any objective measure, his situation was stable and even positive.
But subjective experience told a different story. The ease he had felt during his first month—the sense of belonging somewhere, of building something meaningful—had been replaced by a performance. He played the role of competent administrative support, pleasant colleague, reliable team member. But underneath the facade, he felt like a fool.
His probation period would end in a week. The thought of getting a permanent position should have been elating. It would mean job security and validation of his capabilities. Instead, Jay hoped the decision might be taken out of his hands. If Turner & Associates decided not to offer him a contract, he would have an honorable exit from a situation that had become increasingly uncomfortable.
The thought surprised him with its appeal. To leave with his dignity intact, his work record unblemished, his relationships with colleagues cordial if distant. To escape the constant question of whether he was valued for his contributions or tolerated for reasons he couldn't control.
But even as the fantasy offered temporary comfort, practical reality intruded. Where would he go? Back to the job market that had already proven so hostile? Back to searching for opportunities while wondering which employers might have the wrong motivations for hiring him?
Jay cleared away his dinner dishes and prepared for bed. He was tired—not physically, but spiritually. Tired of wondering about motivations, tired of second-guessing every interaction, tired of the constant vigilance required to protect himself from disappointment.
Whatever decision awaited him, Jay would accept it with the same resignation he had cultivated over the past month. 
Scene 5
The contract
The calendar reminder appeared on Jay's screen at nine-fifteen Monday morning: "Performance Review - I. Hagen - 2:00 PM." Three months had passed since his first day at Turner & Associates, making him eligible for the standard probationary evaluation that would determine his permanent status with the company.
Jay stared at the notification with the same detachement he brought to most aspects of his work life these days. The review would ultimately be completely irrelevant to his sense of self-worth. He would receive feedback, accept whatever decision Ian made, and either leave or continue performing his duties.  
At two o'clock precisely, Jay knocked on Ian's office door and entered when summoned. Ian sat behind his desk with a folder open before him—Jay's personnel file, presumably, containing documentation of his performance over the past three months.  
"Please, sit," Ian said, gesturing to the chair across from his desk. His tone had none of the cool formality that usually characterized their interactions. Instead, he sounded almost... careful.  
Jay sat on the chair, notepad ready though he doubted he would need it. Performance reviews were typically one-way communications.  
"I want to begin by acknowledging the quality of your work," Ian started, consulting the papers before him. "Your performance has been consistently excellent. The compliance audit you completed exceeded expectations, and your coordination work on the Hartwell acquisition was integral to our success."  
Jay nodded politely. "Thank you."  
"Your colleagues have provided uniformly positive feedback. Amy specifically mentioned your reliability under pressure. Luc praised your analytical thinking. Even Kim, who rarely comments on administrative work, noted your technical accuracy."  
The praise should have felt meaningful, but it seemed to reach Jay through layers of cotton wool. He heard the words, understood their positive intent, but felt no corresponding emotional response.  
"That's very kind of them," Jay replied.  
Ian paused, watching Jay's face with an intensity that made him uncomfortable. "Jay, I want to address something directly. I know the transition to this office hasn't been entirely smooth. The... commentary from some team members about your hiring may have been difficult."  
The phrasing told Jay that Ian knew exactly what Max had said, understood the implications, and was attempting to address the damage without explicitly acknowledging it. A diplomatic approach that protected everyone's dignity while solving nothing.  
"I appreciate your concern, but I understand my role here. I'm grateful for the opportunity."  
"Jay, I want to be clear about something. You were hired because we needed competent administrative support. Your performance has exceeded those initial requirements. The work you've produced would be impressive from someone with twice your experience."
Jay met Ian's eyes briefly before looking away. "I try to do my best."
"You succeed. Consistently. Which brings me to the formal outcome of this review. I'm recommending you for permanent employment with Turner & Associates. The position comes with a ten percent salary increase, a standard three year contract and full benefits eligibility."
The offer should have been thrilling. Three months ago, permanent status at a prestigious firm would have felt like winning the lottery. Now it simply felt like an extension of his current circumstances—stable, but emotionally taxing.
"That's very generous. I accept."  
Ian frowned at the flat response. "Jay, you've earned this position. This isn't charity. Your work has been exemplary, and we want to retain that level of competence."  
"I understand. Thank you for the opportunity."
"I..." Ian hesitated, seeming to wrestle with something. "I realize I may have been overly formal in our previous interactions. If that contributed to any sense that your contributions weren't valued, I regret that impression."  
The words came as close to an apology as Ian was likely capable of offering. Jay recognized the gesture for what it was—an acknowledgment that Ian's coldness had been noticed and regretted. But knowing that Ian felt bad didn't make him feel better.  
"You've always been professional," Jay replied diplomatically. "I never expected anything else."
Ian's expression indicated he understood exactly what Jay wasn't saying. The conversation concluded with details about the contract, effective dates, and paperwork that needed completion. Throughout the discussion, Ian's tone remained warm, as if he were trying to compensate for months of deliberate distance.
When Jay returned to his desk, the news spread quickly through the office's informal communication network. Amy appeared first, offering congratulations and a brief hug that Jay accepted with appropriate gratitude. Luc followed, grinning broadly and promising that drinks were mandatory on Friday to celebrate the promotion.
"Turner & Associates permanent status," Ela announced dramatically. "You're officially one of us now. No escaping." 
Kim offered a smile and a brief "Good work" as he passed Jay's desk. Max, thankfully, was in meetings for most of the afternoon and missed the impromptu celebration that developed around the coffee station. 
"Friday drinks are non-negotiable," Luc insisted as the workday wound down. "Murphy's, six-thirty. We have traditions to maintain."
"Of course," Jay agreed. "I'll be there."  
But as his colleagues dispersed to their end-of-day activities, Jay felt no anticipation for the celebration. The permanent position was a practical victory, everything he should want, everything he had wanted just a few months ago.
Instead, he felt tired. The achievement was accepted with gratitude he didn't feel. Jay glanced toward Ian's office, where he was reviewing documents. The performance review had been fair, even generous. The awkward attempt at apology had been genuine, if limited by Ian's own emotional constraints.
Jay understood, intellectually, that he was valued for his contributions. His colleagues respected his work, Ian appreciated his competence, and the company wanted to retain his services. By any reasonable measure, he had succeeded in his goals.
But success felt indistinguishable from survival. He had earned his place by keeping his head down and performing his duties without complaint. The eager hope that had carried him through his first weeks had been systematically crushed, replaced by a resignation that protected him from further disappointment.  
Three months ago, permanent status at Turner & Associates would have felt like the beginning of a career, a foundation for growth and advancement. Now it seemed more like a comfortable prison. The contract would be signed, the salary increase would take effect, and Friday's celebration would be attended. Jay would continue to excel at his job, to exist in the space he had carved out for himself. Even if it felt like slowly rotting inside a respectable tomb.  
Emotional Stakes
Chapter 6: Regaining ground
Scene 1
Celebration
On Friday afternoon, the team gathered at the bar not far from their office that had become their unofficial headquarters for celebrations and commiserations. The walls had witnessed countless toasts to promotions and market victories over the years. To most of the team, the polished wood tables and craft cocktail menu felt like an extension of their desks.
For Jay, this marked only his second visit. He had avoided such gatherings during his probationary period, preferring the safety of his apartment to the uncertain dynamics of office socializing. Now, as the guest of honour celebrating his permanent employment, he sat at the end of a long table while his colleagues raised glasses in his direction.
Everyone had come, including Leo. Amy lifted her martini while Kim drank whiskey and Ela sipped wine between animated conversations. Max had ordered something colourful with too many garnishes, and Luc kept the mood light with jokes. Even Zoe had made the effort to attend, despite her general preference for quieter venues.
"To Jay. The first assistant who actually understands what Ian needs before he asks for it," Amy declared.
"That's because he reads the briefing materials instead of just skimming them," Kim added, raising his glass. "Revolutionary concept around here."
Laughter rippled around the table. Jay managed a smile, the kind he had perfected over recent weeks. The conversation moved on to client updates, the celebration becoming a comfortable backdrop to his own thoughts.
Everyone knew. They had all been aware from the beginning that Leo had hired him as another attempt to catch Ian's interest, another pretty face in a long line of failed experiments. While Jay had thrown himself into learning the intricacies of investment portfolios, convinced he was building something meaningful, his colleagues had been watching a performance play out.
Max appeared beside him, sliding into the chair that Zoe had vacated. The senior analyst's expression was puzzled, as if he still couldn't quite understand how his casual comment had landed so poorly.
"Jay, I wanted to explain about what I said when I got back." Max kept his tone conversational as he once again tried to smooth out the situation with his unfortunate comment. "The joke hire thing. I honestly didn't realize you weren't aware of the circumstances."
"It's fine, Max. Really."
"No, it's not. You looked like I'd punched you. Leo's always bringing in attractive assistants for Ian. It's been going on for years. Everyone just assumes new hires know the deal."
Jay focused on the condensation forming on his beer bottle. "I understand now."
"The thing is, none of them ever lasted more than a few weeks. They were either completely unqualified or caused some kind of drama. But you actually do the work. You understand what we do here. That's why you're staying."
"I appreciate you explaining."
Max waited for more, but Jay offered nothing else. After a moment, the older man squeezed his shoulder and returned to his conversation with Ela about upcoming client presentations.
Across the table, Luc caught Jay's eye and tilted his head in a silent question. When Jay responded with another measured smile, Luc looked unconvinced but didn't press. Instead, he smoothly redirected the conversation away from work entirely.
The lounge's entrance chimed, and the atmosphere changed.
Ian Hagen stepped inside. Conversations paused as heads turned. Ian's appearances at casual team events were so rare that it felt like a celebrity sighting. He wore an impeccable suit, though he had loosened his tie—a concession to the informal setting that somehow made him look more formidable instead.
"Ian!" Leo called out. "You actually came."
"Don't make it a regular expectation," Ian replied, accepting the chair that Amy quickly offered him.
"We're celebrating Jay's transition to permanent staff," Ela explained, though Ian clearly understood exactly why he was there.
"Congratulations," Ian said to Jay directly. The word was delivered with the same gravity he reserved for business announcements.
Jay felt heat rise in his cheeks under that direct attention. Ian made the gathering feel official. The fact that he had come at all sent a message that Jay struggled to interpret—was this mere workplace politeness or something more pointed?
The conversation resumed around them, but Ian remained on its periphery, contributing little beyond polite acknowledgements. Jay became conscious of every word he spoke, every reaction he displayed, wondering what Ian was observing and whether he was measuring up to some unspoken standard.
Ian's attendance felt deliberate. He had come here to make a point, though Jay couldn't decipher what that point might be. The man who had maintained distance for three months was now sitting six feet away, validating Jay's worth more deeply than formal contracts and performance reviews ever could.
After an hour, Ian caught Leo's eye and gave him a subtle nod toward the bar area. "Leo. A word."
Leo followed. They positioned themselves near the far end of the bar, far enough from the team's table that their voices wouldn't reach beyond the ambient noise.
"You need to fix this," Ian said, his voice sharpened with the steel that made subordinates straighten their spines.
"Fix what?"
"Don't play ignorant. Jay knows about your little scheme. Max told him he was a joke hire in front of half the office. He's been walking around like a ghost ever since."
"Shit." Leo's casual demeanour faltered. "When?"
"Weeks ago. Months of effort, and he finds out he was hired as entertainment."
"That's not—"
"That's exactly what it was." Ian cut him off smoothly. "And now he doesn't trust anything. His performance review, his permanent status, my assessment of his abilities. He thinks it's all part of some game."
"I didn't mean for him to find out like that. Max has the subtlety of a freight train."
"Max told the truth. You hired him hoping he'd catch my attention, just like all the others."
"Yes, but—"
"But nothing. You created this mess, Leo. The kid actually believed he'd found a place where his work mattered."
"He's good at the job. That has to count for something."
"It does. But try explaining that to someone who discovered he was the butt of an office joke."
Leo's his expression turned from defensive to regretful. "What do you want me to do?"
"Fix it."
"How?"
"You're the one who made him feel like a fool. You're the one who has to convince him he's not. Talk to him. Explain the situation properly. Make him understand that whatever your initial motivations were, his position is based on merit."
Leo nodded slowly. "You really think he'll listen?"
"I think he deserves better than office gossip and half-apologies." Ian turned to head back to the table, then paused. "And Leo? Next time you want to meddle in my personal life, try not to destroy someone else's confidence in the process."
"There won't be a next time."
"Good."
Leo watched Ian walk away, fighting to suppress the smile that threatened to break across his face. Ian was angry on Jay's behalf. The concern in his friend's voice, the way he'd framed Jay's wounded feelings—it all pointed to something Leo had been hoping to see.
Scene 2
Explanation
As the evening progressed toward midnight, the group began to fragment naturally. Amy and Zoe decided to share a taxi home, while Kim and Ela made plans to continue their night elsewhere. Ian made polite excuses about weekend responsibilities hours ago.
Jay saw his opportunity. He placed money on the table to cover his drinks and edged toward the exit while Luc was engaged in animated discussion with Max.
"Leaving already?"
Jay stopped at the threshold. Leo had materialized beside him, car keys already in hand.
"I should get home. It's been a long week."
"So it has. Come on, I'll drive you."
"That's not necessary. Metro runs all night."
"Metro is unreliable this late on Friday. My car's right outside."
Jay searched Leo's face for traces of the manipulation he now knew had shaped his entire employment. The charm that had once seemed generous now felt calculated. How many conversations had been strategic? How many moments of apparent kindness had served Leo's agenda?
"I appreciate the offer, but I prefer taking the train."
"Jay." Leo's voice had the same inflection he used when redirecting meetings or overruling junior staff suggestions. Not harsh, but unmistakably final. "It's midnight."
The practicality of the argument didn't mask its underlying nature. This wasn't a friendly gesture between colleagues—it was Leo Turner, son of the company owner, making a decision that Jay was expected to accept. The same dynamic that had brought Jay to Turner & Associates in the first place, wrapped in reasonable-sounding concern.
Jay wanted to refuse, to walk away and preserve what little autonomy he could claim. But Leo was already moving toward the door, as if he never doubted that his decisions would be followed. Jay felt powerless as he recognized the futility of resistance.
Leo's BMW waited at the curb, its pristine interior representing more wealth than Jay had ever been close to. The engine started silently, and they merged into the light midnight traffic.
"Address?" Leo asked.
Jay provided directions to his neighbourhood, then focused on the city passing outside his window. The streets felt different at this hour—emptier and stripped of their daytime pretenses.
Leo didn't attempt conversation during the twenty-minute drive, apparently content with the jazz playing through the sound system. Only when they reached Jay's building did he speak again.
"I'm coming up."
"Leo, I'm exhausted. Can we discuss whatever this is on Monday?"
"Five minutes." Leo was already out of the car. "There are things you need to understand."
Jay's apartment occupied the fourth floor of a charming prewar building that maintained its original character despite its age. The absence of a lift meant that residents had to climb a narrow but well-maintained staircase, with walls painted in beige that complemented the building's vintage charm. He unlocked his door and stepped aside, watching Leo inspect the surroundings. 
It was a small studio, furnished with carefully chosen pieces placed strategically to maximize the available space. A compact sofa faced a wooden coffee table. To the left, a tiny kitchenette featured white cabinets and a narrow counter, with a small dining table tucked into the corner. A tall bookshelf stood against the far wall, its shelves neatly organized with books, a few practical items and a small plant. The bed remained hidden behind a closet that created the illusion of separate rooms.
Despite the apartment's size constraints, everything was in excellent condition, creating a welcoming and uncluttered atmosphere.
"This is nice," Leo said, his eyes taking in the pristine arrangements. "Very comfortable."
Jay remained near the door, hoping Leo would recognize the hint and make this brief.
Instead, Leo sat on the couch as if he belonged there, his expensive suit a stark contrast against the well maintained but modest furnishings. His earlier casual aura had disappeared entirely.
"You know why I'm here."
"Not really."
"Max told me about your reaction to his comment. You've been different ever since—quieter, more withdrawn. You think you're some kind of a joke."
Jay moved to the kitchen area, filling a glass with water to give his hands something to do. "Aren't I?"
The directness of the question seemed to catch Leo off guard. He ran his fingers through his hair, disturbing its styling.
"Alright. You want complete honesty? Yes, appearance mattered when I hired you. The CFO's assistant is a client-facing position. You'll accompany Ian to meetings, handle client communications, represent the company. Being presentable isn't optional in this business."
"I see."
"But that wasn't the main factor. Ian is... particular. Finding the right assistant for him is incredibly difficult. He needs someone conscientious but also agreeable. Someone who won't push back when he's under pressure or try to manage his decisions for him."
Jay waited, unsure where this was heading.
"The problem is, in our industry, people with impressive credentials often come with equally impressive egos. They're stubborn, argumentative, convinced they know better than their boss. And I'm terrible at reading people during interviews. I make snap judgements that are wrong more often than right. Every assistant I've hired before fell into one of two categories. Either they couldn't handle the workload and crashed within weeks, or they were calculating. They saw Ian as a stepping stone, tried to use their position to advance their own careers or gain inside information. I kept picking people who were good at pretending to be agreeable, but they all had ulterior motives."
"So?"
"The joke hire comment was about my own terrible track record, not your qualifications. But you were different. Despite having modest credentials on paper, you're dedicated. You learned the role thoroughly and perform it better than any of your predecessors. You're exactly what Ian needed, even if I stumbled into hiring you for partially superficial reasons. It's more than I ever hoped to achieve."
Jay stared at his reflection in the kitchen window, processing this information. 
"I thought I'd found something real. A place where I belonged because of what I could contribute, not because of how I looked."
"You did find that place."
"Did I? Or am I just another experiment that happened to work out better than expected?"
Leo got up, smoothing his jacket. "That's something you'll have to decide for yourself. But consider this—Ian's never attended a celebration for any previous employee. He came tonight specifically to show that he takes you seriously."
Jay turned from the window. "What do you mean?"
"Ian doesn't do casual appearances. Everything he does has purpose." 
The door closed behind Leo, leaving Jay alone in his small apartment. He remained standing in his kitchen, contemplating the conversation and its implications. Leo's explanation had provided answers to questions that had been eating at him, but it had also raised new uncertainties about his place at Turner & Associates.
The safe haven he thought he had found might have been built on foundations he hadn't understood. But perhaps it had evolved into something more authentic.
Scene 3
Resolve
The whiskey burned its way down Ian's throat, as he sat alone in the muted darkness of his living room. The space around him spoke of wealth and taste—furniture selected by interior designers, art chosen for investment value. It was a home that could appear in architectural magazines, photographed for its clean lines and sophisticated palette. It was also a home where Ian spent as little time as possible. 
The silence pressed against him from all sides. No music, no television, no distractions from the thoughts that had been circling his mind since the previous evening. He had deliberately avoided turning on any lights beyond a single lamp in the corner, preferring the half-darkness that matched his mood. The city glittered beyond the windows like scattered diamonds, but he kept his back to the view. 
The liquor burned pleasantly as it slid down his throat, each sip a small punishment for his own behavior. He had overstepped. The realization sat uncomfortably in his chest, a foreign sensation that he couldn't dismiss. Thirteen years at Turner & Associates, and he had never once attended an informal team gathering. His absence from such events was so established that colleagues probably assumed he was physically incapable of casual socializing.  Yet last night, he had walked into Murphy's like it was the most natural thing in the world.  More than that, he had confronted Leo directly, pushing him to explain the circumstances of Jay's hiring. He had essentially demanded that his friend clean up a mess that was causing distress to a subordinate.  
The whiskey provided no answers, only the burn that had become a reliable companion over the years.  Ian tried to convince himself that his actions stemmed from simple fairness. Jay had been performing his duties competently for three months, only to discover that his colleagues viewed him as the latest iteration of Leo's  schemes. Any decent manager would want to correct such a misunderstanding, to ensure that merit was properly recognized.  But the explanation felt thin.  
Jay had never given him a single reason for suspicion. Three months of observation, of watching for tells and inconsistencies, and Jay had remained exactly what he appeared to be: awkward, reserved, committed to doing good work. There had been no signs of the calculated charm that Sam Connelly had wielded so effectively. 
Ian had wanted to catch Jay in some deception. He had been prepared for it, almost eager to confirm his suspicions and validate his defensive instincts. Instead, he had watched a young man throw himself into learning the intricacies of investment management with an enthusiasm that seemed entirely authentic.  
The background check Leo had conducted was already detailed, but Ian had commissioned his own investigation through a private firm that specialized in corporate security. The report had been exhaustive, tracing Jay's life from childhood through his employment history. Every reference had been contacted, every claim verified, every gap explained. 
The picture that emerged was of a man who had never quite found his place in the world. Teachers remembered him as diligent but socially isolated. University records showed solid academic performance but minimal extracurricular involvement.
His previous employers described him as reliable and conscientious, though two of the departures had been rather abrupt.  The details were illuminating beyond what formal documentation could capture. A manager from his first company had mentioned Jay's obvious discomfort around a supervisor who had blatantly sexually harassed him, and HR's dismissive response to his complaints. A colleague from his last job had described how Jay had quit after a coworker's persistent advances made him visibly uncomfortable.
The pattern was consistent: a young man who had learned early that the systems meant to protect him were unreliable, who had developed wariness as a survival mechanism. Ian had never seen anyone look as crushed as Jay had when Max's casual comment revealed the truth about his hiring. The expression of betrayal and humiliation couldn't have been manufactured.
Ian grappled with an uncomfortable realization. Despite his efforts to maintain emotional distance, despite his determination to avoid repeating past mistakes, he had been monitoring Jay with a persistence that showed he cared about the outcome.
More than cared. The admission sat uneasily in his mind, a violation of the defences he had constructed over the years.  He had been watching Jay not just for signs of deception, but for signs of well-being. He had noticed when Jay's initial enthusiasm began to fade, when his eager questions became more cautious, when his posture grew more defensive. Ian had told himself he was simply observing a potential threat, but it was more complicated.  
He had been concerned.  
The realization demanded action, though Ian wasn't sure what form that action should take. Jay deserved better than the impersonal supervision he had received. Ian could provide guidance without compromising himself. He could provide support without risking emotional entanglement. It was possible to be fair, supportive, and decent while maintaining the distance that protected them both.  
The whiskey had grown warm in his hand, its expensive taste wasted on his distracted palate. He set it aside and walked to the windows. Somewhere out there, Jay was probably struggling with his own questions about belonging and worth, questions that Ian could help answer through proper mentorship. Nothing intimate, nothing that would muddy the lines they both needed to maintain. Just guidance that Jay had been seeking from the beginning, that Ian should have been providing all along.  
Even if the ache in his chest pointed at motivations that went beyond obligation, Ian understood the practical realities. Jay's history made him vulnerable, which called for protection, not romantic advances. The difference in their social standing, their ages, the power imbalance between them—all of it created a situation where any personal interest would be inappropriate at best, harmful at worst. He wouldn't allow idle fantasies to compromise his judgment or Jay's well-being.  
But he could be the mentor that Jay had hoped to find when he first started at Turner & Associates. He could live up to the admiration he had seen in Jay's eyes during those early weeks, before disillusionment had replaced hope with resignation. 
The city lights stretched endlessly before him, each one representing dreams and ambitions and the endless human pursuit of something better. Ian had long ago stopped believing in such optimism for himself, but he could still recognize its value in others. He would do better. Not for the sake of connection or intimacy, but for the sake of his own integrity.
Ian returned to his chair and picked up his glass. There was work to be done, relationships to repair, and a young man's faith in mentorship to restore.  Ian could do that much, at least. Even if he couldn't—wouldn't—allow himself to want anything more.
Scene 4
Hope
On Monday morning, Jay was at his desk at seven-thirty. He organized his work and began tackling each task in order. But the office atmosphere was different, as if the weekend had reset more than just the calendar.
Ian arrived just before eight. Nothing in his demeanor hinted that Friday night had been anything out of the ordinary.
"Good morning," Ian said, pausing at Jay's desk. 
"Good morning."
"I wanted to follow up on last week's portfolio summary. The analysis was detailed and the recommendations sound. Well done."
Jay felt heat rise in his cheeks. "Thank you."
"I've scheduled a meeting with the client tomorrow morning. I'd like you to prepare supplementary materials—risk assessments and performance projections for the reallocations."
"Of course. I'll have everything ready by end of business today."
"If you have questions about the projections, don't hesitate to ask. The client can be particular about presentation format."
"I will. Thank you."
Ian moved on to his office, leaving Jay with the tasks of research and analysis. The morning passed uneventfully. Phone calls were answered, emails were processed, and the financial management continued without drama. 
"Morning, Jay," Max cheerfully called from the elevator. "How was your weekend?"
"Quiet. Productive." Jay looked up from his screen, offering a smile. "Yours?"
"Caught up on some reading. Nothing exciting." 
Max continued toward his office, leaving Jay with the distinct impression that the awkwardness between them had dissolved. It was, he realized, a simple interaction that had always characterized their workplace—straightforward, without hidden agendas.
Twenty minutes later, Luc appeared by Jay’s desk, holding his coffee mug.
“Heading to the kitchen for coffee. Want to come?”
Jay looked up and nodded. “Sure, I’ll join you.” 
"Excellent. I was hoping someone would save me from my own company."
Luc led the way down the short corridor, and Jay fell into step beside him. They reached the kitchen doorway together and were greeted by the aroma of fresh coffee as they stepped inside. Jay prepared his coffee while Luc leaned against the counter.
"You seem better today," Luc observed.
"Do I?"
"Less like you're waiting for something terrible to happen."
"Maybe I was."
"Understandable. New jobs can be stressful until you figure out how everything works."
The simplicity of the explanation struck Jay as accurate. He had been waiting for something terrible to happen—not because the job was new, but because experience had taught him that security was temporary, that kindness came with conditions he couldn't meet.
But looking around the kitchen, Jay wondered if he had been preparing for disasters that existed only in his imagination.
At noon, Amy appeared at his desk. "Lunch at Willow & Sage?"
"Sure."
The brisk walk from the office felt invigorating, and once they sat at a large table, the bistro seemed even cosier. 
“It’s like a freezer in my flat. Maintenance says they’ll get to it next week. Next week, my ass,” Ela complained, tugging her scarf loose but keeping it draped around her shoulders.
“You should move into my building,” Zoe said, flipping through the menu without looking up. “Heating’s reliable, and there’s a bakery downstairs. You’d live on croissants.”
“Tempting,” Ela admitted.
“Speaking of temptation—there’s a place I found last weekend. Handmade pasta, truffle oil on everything. You’d love it, Amy. The plating alone is art,” Zoe continued.
“I’m in,” Ela said immediately. “As long as I can feel my fingers while I’m eating.”
The conversation flowed around personal topics. No one put Jay on the spot or demanded his participation, but space was left for him to contribute when he chose to. When Amy asked about his thoughts on a recent market development, he offered his analysis without feeling like he was being tested. 
The food was good as always—rich and well-prepared. Jay ate with appetite, unlike the robotic chewing that had characterized most of his meals lately.
"I hadn’t realized how much I missed being here," he said to Amy as they walked back to the office.
Jay approached the afternoon tasks with mild enthusiasm. The portfolio projections required careful formatting, a detailed assignment that he had always enjoyed.
When he finished the supplementary materials an hour before the official end of business, he felt pride in his analysis. The risk assessments were comprehensive and the presentation format was polished.
"Everything ready for tomorrow?" Ian asked, appearing at his desk as Jay was organizing the final documents.
"All set. I included alternative scenarios for the more volatile holdings."
Ian accepted the folder and spent several minutes reviewing the contents.
"This is excellent work," Ian said finally. "Exactly what the client will need to make informed decisions."
"Thank you."
Jay felt warmth unfurl in his chest, a sensation he had almost forgotten was possible. Not just relief at avoiding criticism, but satisfaction at work well done and properly recognized.
Nothing had changed—his responsibilities were identical, his colleagues were the same people they had been on Friday. But the lens through which he viewed these constant elements had changed. Max's cheerful greeting was simply friendliness, not a test of his ability to fit in. Luc's invitation to the kitchen was casual camaraderie, not a judgement of his social skills. 
Ian’s demeanour was strictly businesslike, but it was never unkind.
Jay had been so prepared for mistreatment that he had interpreted ordinary interactions as potentially hostile. The revelation was both embarrassing and liberating.
Maybe he’d let himself be overly dramatic, allowing the humiliating circumstances of his hiring tint everything that came after. In reality, no one else seemed to care, his colleagues treating him like any other new hire. The only unpleasant thing that had happened to him was Max's initial thoughtless comment, and Max had apologized once he realized his mistake.
Perhaps he’d misread the rest—the perceived coldness, the sense of being on the periphery—and the office was simply what it seemed: civil, capable people.
The test of this new perspective came unexpectedly on Tuseday morning when Ian stopped by his desk with a request that made Jay's stomach drop.
"I have a client meeting at two o'clock. Mayfield wants to review their portfolio allocation. I'd like you to attend and take notes."
Jay felt his composure falter. "You want me in the meeting?"
"Yes. It will be good experience for you to observe how client relationships are managed. Bring your laptop."
After Ian returned to his office, Jay spent the morning in barely controlled panic. He had never attended a client meeting before—at least, not in any meaningful sense. The Hartwell negotiation technically counted, but he’d spent most of it in the background fetching documents and trying not to be noticed. This would be different. He’d be sitting at the table, expected to follow along.
While he’d had minor interactions with clients, answering phones, replying to emails, occasionally greeting them at reception or escorting them to conference rooms, he had never actually been part of a meeting as a participant, face-to-face with the wealthy investors who comprised Turner & Associates’ clientele. What if he said something inappropriate?
At one-fifty, Jay gathered his laptop and headed for the conference room. Ian was already there, reviewing documents, when Jay entered.
"Take a seat near the back. You're here to observe and record."
Mayfield representatives arrived promptly—three middle-aged executives in expensive suits who greeted Ian warmly. Jay remained silent in his corner, trying to project competence while his pulse hammered in his ears.
The meeting proceeded exactly as advertised: a review of investment performance, strategic adjustments, and market projections. Jay dutifully recorded the key points, relieved that the discussion followed predictable patterns that made note-taking manageable. Ian fielded questions and provided detailed explanations without once glancing in Jay's direction.
When the clients left forty-five minutes later, Jay felt drained but proud. He had managed to sit through his first high-level client meeting without embarrassing himself or Ian.
"Could you prepare a brief summary of the key action items we discussed?" Ian asked once they were alone.
Jay spent the next hour crafting a concise overview of the meeting's outcomes, double-checking his notes to ensure accuracy. When he delivered the summary to Ian's office, he watched nervously as Ian read through it.
"This is exactly what I needed. Clear and well-organized. Thank you."
As Jay prepared to leave for the day, cleaning up his desk and reviewing tomorrow's schedule, he felt something he hadn't expected to feel: cautious optimism. Not the desperate hope that had characterized his early weeks, but a timid belief that he might actually belong here after all.
Scene 5
Trust
The days since Monday had slipped by, each one pushing Jay a little further from the shock of learning the truth of his hiring. He remained subdued, though the tight knot of anxiety in his chest had loosened. Thursday unfolded in the same way as any other workday, but by three-thirty that afternoon, the atmosphere changed.
Jay heard the commotion before he saw it—urgent phone calls, rapid conversations, the loud sound of keyboards. Amy rushed past his desk with a stack of files, her normally composed expression strained.
"What's happening?" Jay asked Luc, who was pulling documents from a filing cabinet with unusual speed.
"Fairfield Industries. Their board meeting got moved up to tomorrow morning, and they need our full portfolio analysis tonight." Luc grabbed another folder. "Ian's coordinating the response."
Jay recognized the name immediately. Fairfield Industries was one of their most important clients—one that Ian had brought in himself nearly a decade ago and still managed personally. Everyone in the office understood what that meant: every report, every analysis for Fairfield had to be flawless. There was no margin for error.
Jay watched Ian emerge from his office, moving through the chaos with the same calm he always displayed. He spoke briefly to Max, then Amy, systematically assigning tasks. The office erupted into motion, dominated by a sudden surge of restlessness unlike anything Jay had seen there.
"Jay." Ian's voice cut through the activity. Jay looked up to find Ian standing beside his desk. "I need you to stay late tonight. We have documentation to compile for the Fairfield presentation. Are you available?"
The request was direct and businesslike. Jay felt a flutter of something—not quite nervousness, but heightened awareness. This was the first time Ian had personally asked him to handle something beyond ordinary tasks.
"Of course," Jay said. "What do you need me to do?"
"Start with the quarterly reports from the last twelve months. Pull the relevant sections and organize them chronologically. I'll have the specific parameters ready in twenty minutes."
Ian returned to his office, leaving Jay to gather the necessary files. Around him, the office buzzed with urgency. Even Kim worked without complaint, double-checking the secure connection for Fairfield and monitoring the data transfer to make sure nothing went wrong at the last minute. Jay got caught up in the momentum, relieved to have clear direction and a concrete role to play.
The next three hours were consumed by paperwork and numbers. Jay compiled reports and organized materials according to Ian's specifications. The work was demanding, leaving no room for his self-consciousness. When other colleagues finished their portions and departed, Jay barely noticed. He was absorbed in the task, determined to complete it properly.
At half past ten, he encountered a problem. A file contained a reference to a subsidiary acquisition that didn't match the timeline in the reports. Jay stared at the discrepancy, uncertain whether he'd made an error or if the documents themselves were inconsistent. He checked his work twice, but the numbers refused to align.
The office had grown quiet. Only a few lights remained on, casting long shadows across empty desks. Jay could see Ian working in his office, illuminated by the glow of his computer screen. The memory of their past awkward interaction—his ill-timed question about the acquisition, Ian's swift dismissal—made him hesitate. But the deadline loomed, and he couldn't resolve the discrepancy alone.
Jay approached Ian's office and knocked on the open door. Ian looked up from his screen.
"I'm having trouble with the timeline," Jay said. "There's a discrepancy in the acquisition dates that I can't reconcile."
Ian saved his work and turned to face him completely. "Show me."
Jay laid out the documents on Ian's desk, pointing to the conflicting information. Ian examined the papers with a focused expression.
"This subsidiary was acquired through a shell company," Ian explained, pulling up additional files on his computer. "The official filing date doesn't reflect the actual transaction date. See here—" He pointed to a specific line in the contract. "The effective date is backdated to align with the fiscal quarter. That's why the timeline appears inconsistent."
Ian walked him through the reasoning. The explanation was detailed, delivered without the slightest hint of impatience. Ian answered Jay's follow-up questions, ensuring Jay understood not just the situation but the full history.
"Does that resolve the issue?" Ian asked.
"Yes, completely. Thank you."
Ian returned to his computer, and Jay gathered the documents. The interaction had been exactly what it appeared to be—a manager helping an employee solve a problem. No hidden irritation, just competent guidance.
They worked side by side for another hour, alone in the office. Jay finished his portion of the documentation and began preparing the final presentation folder. Ian reviewed each section, making minor adjustments and additions.
At eleven-fourty, Ian closed his laptop and got up. "That should be sufficient for tomorrow's meeting."
Jay gathered his things, feeling exhausted but also satisfied from work completed properly. As he reached for his coat, Ian spoke again.
"Good work tonight."
The acknowledgement was brief. Jay nodded his thanks and headed for the elevator. Outside, night had already fallen, leaving just sparse headlights on the road and the occasional passerby.
Jay walked to the metro station. The evening replayed in his mind—not the crisis or the long hours, but the moment when he'd needed help and received it. Ian's response had been exactly what a good manager should provide, professional and supportive.
The realization dawned on him gradually as he waited for the train. He had been living with a tension he hadn’t fully acknowledged—the expectation of disappointment, the anticipation of rejection. But tonight wad different. When he'd needed guidance, he'd received it. When he'd completed his work, it had been acknowledged.
As the train pulled into the station, Jay caught himself thinking something he hadn't dared to consider in weeks. "Maybe I don't have to keep flinching. Maybe, in this one small corner of the world, I can actually just do my job."
Chapter 7: A sense of security
Scene 1
Optimism
Expand mother's call about birthdays?
The next morning, the office had the worn-out yet relieved atmosphere that follows a crisis handled well. The Fairfield Industries presentation had gone flawlessly, and by noon, word spread that the client had approved the portfolio recommendations without a single revision.
Amy came in beaming. “No revisions. Not a single one,” she announced, holding up her phone for emphasis. 
Kim didn’t bother hiding his joy, but he still muttered, “Let’s not get used to it.”
Ian appeared in the middle of the open space at one-thirty, addressing the office with his characteristic economy of words. "The Fairfield matter is concluded successfully. Everyone did exceptional work under pressure. Take the rest of the day off."  
The announcement sparked a ripple of surprised murmurs. Jay watched his colleagues gather their things with the bemused smiles of people granted an unexpected gift. Within twenty minutes, the office had emptied except for Ian, who remained at his desk, apparently immune to his own directive.
Jay packed his laptop and left as well. Outside, the afternoon sun felt warmer than expected for late autumn. He walked to the metro, arriving at his apartment at two o'clock to find himself in the unusual position of having nothing urgent to accomplish. He changed into casual clothes and considered his options. The thought of spending the afternoon indoors felt wasteful. He stood in the hallway for a moment, unsure of what to do with himself, until his eyes landed on a book he'd bought long ago and never opened. It felt like the right time. He slipped it into his bag and made his way to Café Lemon.
Since it was still early, the café wasn’t very busy. Only a few patrons occupied the tables, creating a homely atmosphere. He ordered a cardamom latte and an almond croissant, sitting at his preferred table near the window. The barista delivered his order with a friendly nod. 
Jay opened his book to the first page and began to read. The afternoon passed in a manner he'd almost forgotten was possible. The novel occupied his attention, the coffee remained warm in his hands, and the street outside provided a gentle backdrop of activity. Jay felt no need to monitor his surroundings. He simply existed in the moment, reading about space travels and sipping his drink.
Somewhere between the second and third chapters, his thoughts drifted to the previous evening. The crisis had revealed things Ian he always knew to be true but had never thought much about—competence under pressure and reliability.
When Jay had needed help, Ian had provided it. It had been given freely, without making Jay feel diminished for asking.  Jay realized he'd maintained a defensive posture for so long that he'd forgotten what it felt like to simply trust someone's consistency. Ian might be overbearing at times, but he was also fundamentally dependable. When he said he would do something, he did it. When he offered guidance, he meant it. The reliability felt almost foreign after years of dealing with workplace environments built on hidden agendas.
The recognition required swallowing some wounded pride. Jay had spent weeks interpreting Ian's reserve as judgement. But perhaps the distance had been maintained not out of disdain but out of prudent management. Looking back, Jay couldn't identify a single instance where Ian had been unfair or unkind. Strict, certainly. Demanding, without question. But never cruel. 
Despite everything that had happened—the circumstances of his hiring, the awkward early weeks, his own defensive reactions—it felt remarkable to work for someone he could actually rely on.
Jay finished the croissant and ordered another latte, returning to his book, considering the afternoon well spent. The clientele changed from temperate coffee drinkers to a chattier evening crowd. He read three more chapters before the light began to fade, feeling peaceful. 
Jay returned home that evening refreshed, and when Saturday morning came, he decided to tackle the overdue obligation he’d been avoiding for weeks. He made coffee in his small kitchen and dialed his mother's number. The conversation he'd been postponing felt necessary now, grounded in a reality that finally seemed stable enough to share.  
"Jay! I was wondering when you'd call. How are you managing in the city?"  
"I'm doing well, actually. I found a new job a few months ago. It's working out better than I expected."  
"What kind of work?"  
"Administrative assistant at an investment firm. It's more prestigious than my last position, better environment." Jay kept the details deliberately vague, unwilling to explain the complications of his hiring or the background of Turner & Associates. His mother wouldn't understand the significance, and the phone call felt inappropriate for complex explanations.  
"That sounds promising. Are you earning enough to manage your expenses?"  
"Yes, the salary is fair. I'm adjusting well."
They talked for another ten minutes about practical matters—his health, the weather, his mother's work. Jay answered her questions without elaborating, providing just enough information to satisfy her concern without inviting deeper inquiry. When she mentioned his stepfather's promotion and his half-sister's school achievements, he offered congratulations and asked polite follow-up questions.
The conversation ended with the same reserve that had marked their relationship ever since he’d moved to the city. Not cold, but not intimate either. They still cared about each other's well-being, but no longer confided in one another, content to exchange only the necessary pleasantries.
Jay’s mother had given birth to him when she was barely eighteen, and she never spoke about his father. When Jay was ten, she married his stepfather and two years later, his stepbrother was born. In the years that followed, she had two more children—a daughter and another son, the youngest sixteen years younger than Jay. He had never been close with any of them. By the time his siblings were born, he was already a teenager, and he always felt set apart from his mother’s new family. They never treated him unkindly, but he stood out—more guest than true member. As soon as he finished high school, Jay moved away for college and never returned, his visits home growing less frequent with each passing year. Now, he rarely visited more than once a year.
After hanging up, Jay realized why he'd delayed the call for so long. The situation at Turner & Associates had felt too uncertain, too fragile to treat as real. But his perspective had changed recently. The job felt solid now. Maybe not entirely comfortable, but secure.
He spent the rest of Saturday reading, cleaning his apartment, and preparing for the week ahead. By Sunday evening, he managed to finish the book he’d started on Friday, feeling quite happy with the small achievement. The weekend passed leisurely, giving him time to clear his head and look at his life with a fresh perspective. The prospect of returning to work on Monday seemed almost welcoming. Not exciting, but no longer grim. He had a place there, earned through his own efforts and maintained by his own reliability. The cautious optimism that had emerged over the past week remained, tempered by experience, but genuine.
Scene 2
Invitation
At nine o'clock on Monday, Jay's computer chimed with an email that disrupted the week's predictable arc. The subject line read "Celebration Dinner—Hartwell Success" and the sender was Ian himself.
Jay opened the message to find a formal invitation to Friday evening's dinner at The Palladium, an upscale restaurant he'd heard mentioned in conversations. The email explained that the Hartwell contract represented the largest single acquisition in Turner & Associates' recent history, warranting celebration with both company leadership and the entire team. Both Mr. Turner Senior and Leo would attend, along with all staff members who had contributed to the success.
Jay read the invitation twice, feeling the tightness in his stomach that always accompanied high-stakes social situations. He'd attended one company function since joining Turner & Associates—a quarterly gathering that had left him acutely aware of his position at the bottom of the office hierarchy. The prospect of another formal event, with senior leadership present, felt equally daunting. 
He minimized the email and opened a new browser tab, searching for information about The Palladium. The restaurant's website featured elegant photographs of crystal glassware and artfully arranged plates. The dress code was listed as "business formal," which at least provided clear guidance. He thought of the blue suit hanging in his closet—purchased specifically for the last company function and worn only once. At least he wouldn't feel completely out of place.
The morning passed on mundane tasks, but Jay periodically returned to the dinner invitation. Around him, his colleagues discussed the upcoming event with evident enthusiasm. Amy mentioned making reservations at a nearby salon for Friday afternoon. Kim wondered aloud whether the wine selection would justify the evening's inevitable length. 
At lunch, the team gathered at Captain's Table, a seafood restaurant close the office that was Ela's favourite. Jay ordered something simple, contributing minimally to the conversation.  
"Has everyone seen the dinner invitation?" Amy asked, cutting into her salmon. "The Palladium is supposed to be exceptional." 
"I've eaten there twice," Max said. "The food is remarkable, but the atmosphere is rather stuffy. All white tablecloths and hushed conversations."  
"Perfect for impressing the senior Turner," Ela added.
Jay fidgeted in his seat, trying to appear casual. "I have to admit, I'm not entirely comfortable with these upscale places. I always feel like I'm going to use the wrong fork or something."  
The admission drew understanding nods from several colleagues. Luc grinned and pointed his own fork at Max. "You don't have anything to worry about. Max will inevitably make some completely inappropriate comment about the waitstaff, and everyone will be too busy trying not to laugh to notice anyone else's table manners."  
"I resent that characterization," Max replied with an exaggerated sigh. "My comments are always perfectly appropriate for the situation."  
"Right. Like when you asked the event planner if the floral arrangements were supposed to look like they’d come from a supermarket," Kim said.
Max waved dismissively. "That was a legitimate question."  
Even Jay laughed at the exchange. In hindsight, Max’s blunt remarks about his appearance seemed less mortifying than he’d remembered—more a product of Max’s lack of tact than anything personal. Max never singled anyone out, his offhanded comments were just part of how he handled social situations, careless but never truly mean-spirited.
“See?” Luc said, nodding toward Jay’s smile. “With Max around, all you have to do is stand behind him and let him soak up the attention. No one’s going to notice you with him in the room.”
“Unbelievable. My honesty is a rare commodity in this world, and all I get is grief.” Max protested.
The conversation drifted into stories of awkward company dinners, and Ela immediately jumped in. “Do you remember that holiday dinner at Rossi’s, when Allen was still around?”
Kim snorted. “How could I forget? He was three glasses in and started ranting about corporate culture—right in front of Ian.”
Ela grinned. “Didn’t he call Ian ‘the most uptight man in a fifty-kilometre radius’?”
Kim mimicked the voice: “‘If you ever want to learn how to strangle the joy out of a room, just watch Ian at a social event.’” Kim shook his head, still amused. “The whole table went silent. I thought Ian was going to snap.”
Jay glanced at them, interested. “What did Ian do?”
Ela’s grin widened. “He just looked at Allen and said, dead serious, ‘My radius is at least a hundred kilometres.’”
Kim broke in, laughing. “Everyone lost it. Allen couldn’t even come up with a comeback. I think that’s when their feud started.”
Ela rolled her eyes. “Yeah, and then Allen went to work for the competition six months later.”
Jay listened, surprised. He hadn’t known that side of Ian existed. For a moment, he tried to picture it—the unflappable boss making a perfectly-timed joke. The image seemed almost alien.
The relaxed atmosphere around the table reflected their recent success—everyone, even Jay, seemed pleased with their work and comfortable with the recognition it had earned.
When they returned to the office, Jay felt some of his anxiety diminish. The dinner remained intimidating, but it no longer felt like a solitary ordeal. He would be surrounded by colleagues he'd grown to understand, attending an event that celebrated work he'd actually contributed to completing.  
That evening, Jay sat in his apartment, considering his wardrobe. He checked his good suit and polished his shoes, then sorted through his shirts and ties, trying to decide which combination looked most suitable for the occasion. He hesitated over each choice, wondering if they were good enough. 
For a moment, he wondered if he should buy another suit. He could afford it now, at least. But after a moment’s thought, he decided against it. The one he had was more than fine and perfectly adequate for the venue. He wasn’t trying to impress anyone—just get through the evening. He set everything in order and tried to put the dinner out of his mind.
The nervousness remained, but it felt manageable now. He'd attended similar events before. The dinner wasn't a test of his worthiness. It was just another obligation, made slightly more bearable by the knowledge that his colleagues would be equally uncomfortable with the formal atmosphere. Max would indeed make inappropriate comments, Amy would handle the social dynamics with ease, and Jay would simply need to dress appropriately and avoid drawing attention to himself. 
Scene 3
Dinner
The following week was more frantic than usual. The Hartwell contract was finalized, injecting new momentum into every project. The new client required immediate attention, and Ian competently coordinated the expanded workload.
The first formal briefing concerning Hartwell happened on Tuesday morning. Ian stood at the head of the conference table, outlining the portfolio requirements.
"The integration timeline is aggressive," Ian said, consulting his notes. "Amy, I need the full  market analysis completed by Thursday. Max, handle the domestic projections. Kim, your systems integration assessment is due Wednesday afternoon."
He continued down the list, assigning tasks to the whole team. When Ian reached his name, Jay felt a flutter of nervousness.
"Jay, coordinate the documentation review with Amy and ensure all materials are properly formatted for client delivery. Questions?"
Jay shook his head. Around the table, his colleagues asked practical questions about deadlines. The meeting concluded with the workload divided among the team members, while Ian remained at the helm of the project, personally handling the most crucial aspects.
As the week progressed, conversation increasingly turned to Friday's dinner. The women in the office engaged in animated discussions about attire, makeup and hair styling. Jay listened to these conversations with growing unease, acutely aware of his inexperience with formal dining protocols.
Thursday afternoon, as Jay struggled to concentrate over routine paperwork, Luc appeared at his desk
"You look like you're contemplating a difficult mathematical problem," Luc observed.
"I'm trying to figure out how to avoid embarrassing myself tomorrow night. I've never eaten at a place like The Palladium before. I keep imagining myself knocking over wine glasses."
"Ah, the classic anxiety of the overly fancy restaurant. What specifically are you worried about? The sixteen different forks or the wine selection that requires a PhD in viticulture?"
"All of it, honestly. I don't want to do something obviously wrong in front of Turner Senior."
"Here's the secret," Luc said, lowering his voice conspiratorially. "Nobody actually cares about the rules as much as you think they do. Just follow what everyone else does. Don't drink from the finger bowl. If someone offers wine, say yes and take small sips. If you're uncertain about anything, watch Ian—he handles these situations flawlessly."
"What about conversation? I never know what to say at these things."
"Ask questions about other people's work. Everyone enjoys talking about their expertise, and it keeps the focus off you."
Jay laughed despite his anxiety. "You make it sound almost manageable."
"That's because it is. Remember, Turner Senior is intimidating but predictable. He'll spend most of the evening discussing market conditions. Just nod thoughtfully, don't get drunk, and you'll be fine. The worst that can happen is you accidentally use the salad fork for the main course, and honestly, Max will probably do something far more embarrassing within the first hour."
"I appreciate the reassurance. Even if it comes at Max's expense."
"Max can handle it. Besides, he'd probably be offended if we didn't expect him to provide entertainment."
The practical advice helped more than Jay expected. As Thursday evening approached, he felt his preparation was as complete as it could be. The suit was pristine, his shoes polished, and Luc's guidance had provided a basic framework for managing the evening's social requirements.
Friday evening was unseasonably warm for late autumn. Jay took a taxi to The Palladium, arriving precisely at the designated time. The restaurant exceeded his expectations in elegance. Instead of the vast, impersonal space he'd imagined, it featured a series of smaller dining rooms. 
Their party had been seated in a private room that felt more like an exclusive club than a public restaurant. Jay counted twelve people: the seven regular team members, Ian, Leo, Turner Senior, and two senior partners he recognized but had never spoken to. 
Turner Senior commanded attention without effort—a man in his seventies who dominated the room despite his modest stature. Jay had seen him perhaps three times in the office corridors, always at a distance, always surrounded by an aura of authority.
"Jay, you're here," Ian said, rising briefly as Jay approached. "Take the seat between Luc and Kim."
Luc gave a thumbs-up, and Jay took his designated chair, relieved to be positioned between his colleagues. Everyone looked glamorous—women in smart dresses, men in well-fitted designer suits. Jay felt distinctly under-dressed by comparison, acutely aware of the ordinary cut of his jacket. It didn’t help that he caught Ian’s eyes on him more than once, though he couldn’t read anything in Ian’s expression. Meanwhile Kim launched into a commentary about the wine list.
"Look at these prices," Kim muttered, showing Jay the leather-bound menu. "Forty dollars for a glass of wine that probably costs them eight."
"Value assessment again?" Luc asked with a grin.
"Market analysis," Kim corrected. "I'm curious about markup strategies."
The meal began with cocktails and appetizers. Jay sampled the wine selection with appreciation, thankful for Luc's earlier advice about following Ian's lead. The conversation around the table flowed with ease. 
"The scallops are amazing," Amy commented.
"Everything here is exceptional," Max replied. "Including the prices. Though I suppose successful ventures deserve appropriate celebration."
Turner Senior seemed interested in the team's work on the Hartwell contract. Ian guided the discussion with skill, highlighting each team member's contributions while deflecting Turner Senior's more probing questions.
"The documentation process was rigorous," Ian said, addressing Turner Senior's inquiry about quality control. "Jay coordinated the review process and ensured all materials met client specifications."
Jay felt a moment of panic as Turner Senior's attention moved to him, but Ian smoothly transitioned to discussing Amy's market analysis, drawing focus away before Jay needed to respond. The conversation moved past Jay, but he felt the warmth of being acknowledged. Ian had included him naturally, without putting him on the spot.
The pattern continued throughout the evening. When Turner Senior asked pointed questions about project timelines, Ian provided comprehensive answers. When the conversation veered toward office politics or personnel decisions, Ian redirected toward technical achievements. When Turner Senior began discussing regulatory changes, Ian guided the conversation to include everyone's perspective.
"The new compliance requirements will affect our entire client base," Turner Senior said, his tone growing more serious. "Particularly the smaller portfolios that lack dedicated legal resources."
"That's where our advisory services become crucial," Ian replied. "We can provide the expertise they need without the overhead of full-time staff."
"Assuming we can scale appropriately," Turner Senior said. "Increased demand means increased responsibility. Are we prepared for that level of growth?"
"We have the core expertise. The challenge is ensuring consistent quality as we expand our client base."
As the main course arrived, Jay realized he enjoyed the evening more than he'd expected. The food was exceptional—a perfectly prepared salmon with some sort of elaborate sauce. The wine was undeniably excellent. 
"So Jay," Luc said, turning to him, "what's your take on fine dining? Living up to the hype?"
"The food is amazing. I can see why places like this have waiting lists. Though I have to admit, I was expecting something more intimidating."
"Intimidating how?" Ela asked.
"Stuffy waiters and complicated etiquette. This feels almost... comfortable."
As the evening progressed, the conversation ranged from work achievements to harmless gossip about competing firms. Jay contributed occasional comments—nothing profound, but small observations that earned nods of agreement from his colleagues.
"The international markets have been particularly volatile," Amy was saying, addressing a question from one of the senior partners. "Our projections account for the uncertainty, and client confidence remains strong."
"That's partly due to the presentation quality," Leo added, raising his glass slightly. "This team knows how to make complex data accessible to decision-makers."
Jay sipped his wine and listened to the discussion. The atmosphere was more relaxed than he'd anticipated. Jay realized he hadn't felt excluded or out of place since arriving. Ian's management of the conversation had been masterful. The team dynamic worked even in this setting, with light jokes that spoke to real camaraderie.
"I have to say," Turner Senior announced as dessert arrived, "this acquisition represents strategic thinking that built this company. Well done, all of you."
The acknowledgement sparked a round of pleased murmurs and raised glasses. As the evening wound down and colleagues began gathering their coats, Jay marveled at how different the night had been from his expectations. The formal setting had been intimidating, but the people had remained friendly, and Ian's leadership had created a protective atmosphere that allowed everyone to have a good time.
"Good evening, everyone," Ian said as they prepared to leave. "Excellent work, as always."
Jay collected his coat and followed his colleagues toward the exit, feeling the satisfaction of a successful evening. The anxiety that had plagued him for days had proven largely unfounded.
Scene 4
Planning
Jay approached the office with a different perspective on Monday morning. The weekend had provided time to process Friday's dinner, and he'd returned to work with something he hadn't expected: confidence in his place at Turner & Associates.
The standard start of the week briefing convened at nine-thirty in the the local conference room. Jay took a seat and opened his notebook, but noticed he no longer felt the tension that had characterized these meetings for months.
"The Hartwell integration is proceeding on schedule," Ian began, consulting his notes. "Ela, how are the international market adjustments progressing?"
"Ahead of timeline," Ela replied. "Clients had been responsive to our recommendations."
Ian nodded and continued through the agenda. When he reached Jay's assignments, the interaction felt easier than it had in previous weeks.
"Jay, the documentation review you completed last week was well done. Continue with the same approach for the Hoist Materials portfolio. Questions?"
"No questions. I'll have the preliminary review completed by Wednesday afternoon."
"Good."
The meeting continued, but Jay noticed Ian's attention during the exchange. Not scrutiny, exactly, but a kind of evaluating awareness. The attention didn't feel intrusive or suspicious—more like a manager monitoring an employee's development.
After the meeting, Jay returned to his desk with a clearer understanding of something that had been developing over the past weeks. Ian's leadership style wasn't about friendship or personal warmth. It was about creating an environment where everyone could perform their best work. The correction Jay had received months ago—the one that had felt so devastating at the time—had simply been feedback delivered without unnecessary cushioning.
Jay had interpreted Ian's directness as personal rejection because he'd been hypersensitive to any sign of disapproval. In those first weeks, Ian’s distance had seemed deliberate and unyielding. Looking back now, Jay realized it was simply the natural lack of rapport between a manager and an unfamiliar employee. Ian treated everyone with the same standard—he didn’t coddle anyone, but he also didn’t single anyone out. It was foolish, Jay thought, to have read so much into it.
"You look thoughtful," Luc observed, appearing at Jay's desk with a cup of coffee. "Deep philosophical contemplation or just Monday morning confusion?"
"A bit of both, probably. I was just thinking about management styles."
"Ian's approach, you mean? He's definitely not the warm and fuzzy type, but he's probably the most competent manager I've ever worked for."
"That's exactly what I was thinking. He doesn't waste time on unnecessary social niceties, but he's completely reliable."
"And he protects his team. Did you notice how he handled Turner Senior's questions on Friday? Every time the old man started probing too deeply, Ian redirected the conversation."
Jay had noticed, though he hadn't fully appreciated the skill involved. "He made it look effortless."
"That's what good management looks like. You don't always see it happening, but you benefit from it constantly."
The conversation was interrupted by Kim's arrival, holding a stack of documents and wearing an expression of mild exasperation.
"Have you received the holiday party emails? Christmas party on December fifteenth, end-of-year gala on January twenty-third. My social calendar is now completely full."
"I got them this morning," Amy said, joining the impromptu gathering. "The gala is always elaborate. Last year's theme was 'Winter Elegance' and the decorations were stunning."
"What's the difference between the Christmas party and the gala?" Jay asked.
"The Christmas party is for staff," Ela explained, appearing with her own coffee. "More casual, though still formal dress. The gala includes major clients and industry contacts. It's the most important networking event of the year."
"And the food is amazing," Max added, joining the conversation circle that had formed around Jay's desk. "The gala budget is apparently out of this world."
"Are you planning to attend both events?" Amy asked Jay directly.
"I hadn't really considered not attending," Jay replied. "Though I suppose I should start thinking about what to wear to a gala."
"Last time was just formal—this one is strictly black tie," Luc said. "And if you survived The Palladium, you can handle anything the gala throws at you."
The group continued discussing holiday plans, and Jay contributed to the conversation without the self-monitoring that had characterized the previous weeks. When Kim made a sarcastic comment about mandatory fun, Jay laughed. When Ela asked about his Christmas plans, he admitted he hadn't decided yet.
"I'm considering whether to visit my family," Jay said. "Last year was somewhat difficult, and I'm not sure I want to repeat the experience."
"Family gatherings can be complicated," Amy said with understanding. "Sometimes the obligations don't match the reality."
"Exactly. I'm torn between doing what I'm supposed to do and doing what might actually be good for me."
"What would be good for you?" Luc asked.
"Honestly? I'm not sure. Part of me thinks spending Christmas alone would be depressing, but another part thinks it might be peaceful."
"There's no shame in choosing peace," Max said. "Family dynamics don't improve just because it's Christmas."
The conversation continued for another few minutes before everyone dispersed to their respective tasks. Jay returned to his work with the pleasant awareness that he'd participated in normal office small talk without self-consciousness.
As the day progressed, Jay thought about the holiday invitations. The Christmas party and gala didn't seemed intimidating. He understood the office dynamics well enough to handle future events with confidence. More importantly, he felt more like a legitimate member of the team, no longer being  an outsider struggling to fit in.
The question of Christmas remained unresolved, but even that decision felt less fraught than in previous years. He knew he now had a valid excuse to skip the trip if he really didn’t feel up to it, and that possibility gave him a measure of peace. The pressure to choose between family obligation and his own comfort had eased, replaced by the reassurance that he wasn’t trapped by expectation.
From his office, Ian observed the gathering around Jay's. The laughter indicated that the damage from the earlier misunderstandings had been largely repaired. Jay's integration into the team had been slower than Ian had hoped, but it appeared to be genuine now. The distance he'd maintained had been a necessary protection, but it had also caused unintended harm. Jay's gradual recovery suggested resilience, and Ian found comfort in that.
Scene 5
Exhaustion
The last two weeks of November blurred into one unending stretch of work. Ian arrived before most of the team and left after midnight more than once, spreadsheets glowing against the dark glass of his office windows. The Hartwell integration demanded more oversight than any project in recent memory, but Ian welcomed the pressure. It was a relief to drown out unwanted thoughts with impossible deadlines and numbers that didn’t care about human failings.
The acquisition had been Ian's initiative, a decision that surprised even Leo when Ian presented the proposal during their weekly leadership meeting. Most new client acquisitions came through established networks or referrals, but Ian had identified Hartwell as a strategic opportunity and pursued them directly.
"This is somewhat unusual for you," Leo had observed, reviewing the client profile. "You typically prefer managing existing relationships."
"The portfolio potential is significant," Ian had replied, which was true but incomplete. The complete truth was more complicated: Ian needed a distraction that would demand his full attention and eliminate the growing problem of his focus on Jay Hall.
The realization had crept up on him gradually. At first, Ian had attributed his heightened awareness to caution—the natural vigilance that came from having been deceived before. But as weeks passed and Jay was consistently reliable, Ian's attention had turned from suspicious monitoring to something more troubling. Jay's combination of competence and vulnerability, his earnest dedication to work, his obvious gratitude for basic courtesy—all of it appealed to Ian more than he wanted to acknowledge.
Leo had been right about Jay's innocence. The corporate spy theory had been paranoid projection, a way of avoiding the more uncomfortable truth that Ian simply found his assistant compelling. The solution was obvious: redirect his attention to something that would consume his focus entirely.
Hartwell provided exactly that opportunity. The acquisition required intensive analysis and comprehensive portfolio development that would demand sixteen-hour days and weekend work. Ian threw himself into the project, hoping that exhaustion would cure his inconvenient interest in Jay.
The strategy worked, mostly. Ian arrived at the office before seven each morning and rarely left before nine at night. He brought work home, spreading documents across his dining table and working until his eyes burned with fatigue. Weekends became extensions of the workweek, spent hunched over laptops and financial reports.
The pace was unsustainable, but it was also effective. Ian's thoughts, previously prone to wandering toward Jay during quiet moments, remained focused on portfolio optimization. When Jay appeared in his office with questions, Ian addressed the matter at hand without the unwelcome personal awareness.
For Jay, the change was subtle at first. He always arrived early, before the office lights fully brightened, but day after day, Ian was already there, reviewing documents as if he was chasing a clock only he could see.
Luc noticed as well. “First weeks with a new client always mean chaos,” he told Jay, passing by his desk one morning with a sympathetic shrug. “It’ll calm down. Ian just sets a pace no one else can keep up with.”
Jay nodded, but couldn’t shake a sense of unease as the days wore on. He watched Ian move through each day relentlessly, the briefest pauses for coffee or conversation even rarer than usual. Ian’s responses became almost mechanical, as if he’d excised all but the most essential parts of himself for the sake of the assignment.
The team adapted well to the increased workload, but Ian still monitored their stress levels, redistributing tasks when necessary and ensuring no one felt overwhelmed by the accelerated timeline. What he didn't monitor was his own condition, which deteriorated steadily as November drew to a close.
By the end of the month, Ian's reflection in the bathroom mirror showed the accumulated effects of weeks without adequate rest. He looked a little more disheveled than usual—his tie was slightly askew, his hair less tidy, and there were dark circles under his eyes.
Jay noticed the change during their Monday morning briefing. Ian's presentation remained sound and his assignment distribution remained fair, but his manner indicated he operated on insufficient sleep and excessive caffeine. The observation made Jay uncomfortable, because Ian appeared to be pushing himself beyond reasonable limits.
"The Hartwell integration timeline remains aggressive," Ian was saying, consulting notes that seemed more extensive than usual. "We need the final review ready by Friday afternoon."
Jay nodded, making notes about the deadlines for the specific projects. His colleagues asked additional questions, and Ian answered each inquiry in detail, but Jay noticed the slight hesitation before responses.
After the meeting, Jay returned to his desk with a growing sense of concern. Ian's dedication was admirable, but the pace seemed to exhaust him. Jay had no basis for commenting on his supervisor's work habits, but he could at least ensure that Ian's daily management burden remained as light as possible.
Over the following days, Jay anticipated administrative needs before they became problems. He prepared meeting materials in advance and handled correspondence without requiring Ian's input. When colleagues needed guidance on project coordination, Jay provided it when possible, reserving Ian's time only for decisions that required senior management attention.
The effort was largely invisible, designed to eliminate small irritations. Jay streamlined processes and ensured that Ian's schedule remained manageable despite the increased workload. It was a modest contribution, but one that might allow Ian to focus on strategic matters without distraction.
Ian noticed the improved efficiency without initially connecting it to Jay's deliberate efforts. Documents appeared properly organized and routine tasks seemed to require less attention than usual. It wasn't until Thursday afternoon, when Jay appeared with a comprehensive status report on the Hartwell documentation process, that Ian recognized the pattern.
"This is very detailed," Ian said, reviewing the report.
"I wanted to make sure you had everything you needed for the client review."
The statement was matter-of-fact, but Ian detected the underlying intention. Jay was attempting to lighten his workload. The approach was tactful, offering support without commenting on Ian's condition.
"Thank you. This will be helpful."
Jay nodded and returned to his desk, leaving Ian to consider the dedication with which his assistant had been managing the increased demands. The support was exactly what Ian needed—unobtrusive but effective, competent without being presumptuous.
Ian's attempt to distract himself from inappropriate interest in Jay had only resulted in even greater appreciation for him. 
Chapter 8: The festive season
Scene 1
Decorations
December came on with a biting cold, catching the city by surprise. After months of unseasonably warm weather, winter finally announced itself with sharp winds and frost that decorated office windows with delicate patterns. Along with the drop in temperature, a festive atmosphere filled the building, and by the second week of December, the lobby displayed an enormous Christmas tree that commanded attention from everyone entering the Northlight Financial Center.
At Turner & Associates, the crisis pace of the Hartwell integration had finally subsided. The initial chaos of bringing on a major new client turned manageable, with tasks distributed among the team. Ian's insane days had returned to more reasonable proportions, and the exhaustion that had characterized his appearance throughout November had lifted.
Jay noticed the change immediately. Ian's morning briefings proceeded without the underlying fatigue that had marked recent weeks. His clothes resumed their typical perfection, and the slight hesitation that had crept into his responses disappeared. The relief Jay felt at seeing Ian return to normal surprised him.
"The Christmas tree debate begins today," Luc announced, appearing at Jay's desk with theatrical solemnity. "Brace yourself for the annual display of office democracy at its most chaotic."
"Christmas tree debate?" Jay asked, looking up from his screen.
"Office tradition," Kim explained, joining the conversation. "Every year, administration sets up the lobby tree, and every year, we decorate our own tree in the office area. And every year, we spend an hour arguing about colour schemes before Ian intervenes with executive authority."
"It's actually quite entertaining," Ela added, pulling three large storage boxes from the supply closet. "Amy has strong opinions about aesthetic cohesion, Max believes in festive chaos, and everyone else just wants to hang ornaments without extended philosophical discussions."
Jay watched with curiosity as his colleagues gathered around the boxes, which overflowed with decorations accumulated over years of celebrations. The two metre pine tree stood in the corner, undecorated but filling the space with the scent of evergreen. Office Christmas trees had been nonexistent at his previous workplace, where holiday acknowledgement consisted of a single poinsettia in the reception area and a brief mention in the company newsletter.
"This year, I'm advocating for a sophisticated monochromatic approach," Amy announced, unpacking silver ornaments. "Silver and white, perhaps with touches of gold for warmth."
"Absolutely not," Max declared, pulling out a collection that appeared to represent every colour in the spectrum. "Christmas trees should be joyful. The more colours, the better."
"That's not joyful, that's overwhelming," Amy protested. "There's beauty in restraint."
"There's boredom in restraint," Max countered, holding up a particularly garish red and green ornament. "This is what Christmas should look like."
Luc turned to Jay with an expression of amused resignation. "This happens every year. They'll argue until Ian arrives and makes a decision that pleases no one and somehow works perfectly."
Jay watched the good-natured bickering with amusement. Amy arranged ornaments by colour and size, Max deliberately mixed patterns and textures.
“It’s not a hostage negotiation, Amy,” Kim said. “And Max, I’m not sure chaos counts as a design philosophy.”
"What's your preference?" Ela asked Jay. "Are you team sophisticated minimalism or team festive chaos?"
"I've never really had strong opinions about Christmas decorations. I enjoy whatever other people created."
"A diplomatic answer," Luc said approvingly. "Perfect for avoiding the crossfire."
The debate continued for another ten minutes, with Amy and Max presenting increasingly elaborate arguments for their respective approaches. Jay enjoyed the theatrical nature of their disagreement, recognizing it as a silly conflict that only emerged among people who liked each other.
"What seems to be the annual crisis?" Ian emerged from his office, surveying the scene with an expression of patient resignation.
"Colour scheme dispute," Amy and Max said simultaneously, then glared at each other.
Ian approached the boxes of decorations, examining the contents. "Crystal and teal," he said after a moment's consideration. "Purple accents, silver details. It's festive and sophisticated without being sterile."
Amy and Max exchanged looks of mutual dissatisfaction, but neither protested. The compromise had the advantage of disappointing both parties equally.
"Crystal and teal it is," Amy said.
"I suppose that's acceptable," Max agreed grudgingly.
The team, freed from decision-making paralysis, began enthusiastic decorating. Jay got paired with Ian, hanging strings of silver garland while his colleagues distributed ornaments. The work was surprisingly intimate, requiring tight cooperation.
"Hand me that section," Ian said, indicating a length of garland that had tangled around Jay's feet.
Jay passed the decoration, their fingers brushing briefly in the exchange. The contact was entirely accidental, but it left Jay with an unexpected awareness of Ian's proximity. They adjusted the garland until it draped properly across the tree's branches.
"This is nice," Jay said, stepping back to examine their work. "I'd forgotten how much I enjoy Christmas decorating."
"You don't celebrate at home?" Ian asked, fixing a silver ornament.
"I haven't had space for decorations. And since I live alone, it never seemed worth the effort."
Ian glanced at him with an expression Jay couldn't interpret. "Will you be traveling to see family this year?"
"I'm still deciding. Last year the atmosphere was pretty tense, and I'm not sure I want to repeat the experience."
They continued working, adding crystal baubles and straightening the lights. Around them, the office was filled with the cheerful noise of collaborative effort. Luc and Kim debated the placement of purple accents, Amy ensured the colour distribution remained balanced, and Max added silver details with slightly more enthusiasm than his earlier protests had suggested.
Jay got caught up in the holiday spirit. The bickering of his colleagues, the joy of creating something beautiful together—all of it felt like a Christmas tradition he'd always imagined.
"There," Ian said, adjusting the final section of garland. "That should be properly balanced."
Jay looked at the tree, now turned by their collective work into something truly festive. The crystal ornaments caught the office lights, the teal and purple accents provided just enough colour to avoid monotony, and the silver details added elegance.
"It looks perfect," Jay said, meaning it completely. "Much better than I expected from a compromise solution."
"Compromise solutions often work better than anyone anticipates," Ian replied.
As the decorating concluded, Jay felt content. The office was warm and welcoming and even the mundane work tasks seemed more pleasant in the festive atmosphere.
As Jay prepared to leave the office in the afternoon, he considered something he'd never contemplated before: buying Christmas decorations for his own apartment. With his first full paycheck as a permanent employee deposited in his account—even larger than his previous salary—he finally had  the financial security to indulge in unnecessary but pleasant expenses.
The idea of having his own small Christmas tree, decorated according to his own preferences, felt increasingly appealing, even if he didn't really have space for it. Jay was beginning to understand what it meant to create comfort instead of merely enduring circumstances.
Scene 2
Christmas preparations
On Friday, just after work, Jay stood before the display window of an upscale tailor, studying the elegant evening wear arranged behind the glass. The mannequins wore impeccable black-tie attire—tuxedos with silk lapels, white shirts and bow ties.
"Good afternoon," the salesman said as Jay entered the shop. "How can I help you today?"
"I need a tuxedo for a company function," Jay replied, still adjusting to the idea that he belonged in such an establishment. "Something appropriate for a formal gala."
The salesman appraised him with a practised eye. "Excellent. When is the event?"
"January twenty fourth."
"Perfect timing. We'll have everything ready well before then. A proper fitting will take about four weeks—we pride ourselves on meticulous tailoring."
The salesman led him through the process, taking measurements and discussing fabric options. The final price would have horrified him six months ago, but now he nodded and provided his credit card information without the knot of anxiety in his stomach.
"We'll call you when everything is ready," the salesman said, handing him a receipt. "You'll look magnificent."
The compliment left Jay uneasy. He gave awkward thanks and hurried out of the shop.
His next stop was the small garden centre. The scent of evergreens hit him immediately—fresh, clean, and somehow hopeful. He wandered through the rows of trees, most of them far too large for his modest apartment.
"Looking for something specific?" asked a woman in a canvas apron.
"Something small," Jay said. "I have limited space."
She led him to a section of tabletop trees, each one perfectly proportioned despite their diminutive size. "These are lovely for apartments. They smell just as good as the big ones."
Jay selected a tree that reached barely fifty centimetres tall with full and symmetrical branches. The woman helped him choose a simple stand and wrapped the tree in protective netting.
"You'll want to get it in water soon," she advised. "And don't put it near any heat sources."
Jay thanked her and hauled his purchase to the nearby department store, where he spent an hour selecting ornaments. He chose crystal balls, silver garland that reminded him of the office decorations, and a string of warm white lights. The selections was deliberate—each piece contributing to a specific vision he hadn't realized he'd been forming.
Back in his apartment, Jay cleared space on the wide windowsill—one of the few spots that could accommodate the tree. He pushed aside a stack of books, then set the tree in place. After filling the stand with water, he adjusted the tree until it stood straight, makinh the best use of the limited space.
The lights went on first, their warm glow transforming the modest space immediately. Jay wound them around the branches, ensuring even coverage. The crystal ornaments came next, each one catching the light in different ways. Finally, he draped the silver garland, stepping back periodically to assess the overall effect.
The finished tree was tiny but radiant. It filled the corner with gentle light and the fresh scent of pine, making the entire apartment feel different—more like home.
Jay sat on his couch and admired his work. The tree represented something he'd never allowed himself before, decorating simply because he wanted to, not because it served any practical purpose.
Jay finally picked up the phone to call his mother. He’d decided to stay home for Christmas this year, and the thought of breaking the news had been weighing on him for days. As he waited for her to answer, he steeled himself for the conversation he’d been dreading.
"Hi, Mom."
"Jay! How are you, honey? I was just thinking about Christmas plans."
"Actually, that's what I wanted to talk to you about. I don't think I can make it home this year."
"Oh," his mother said finally. "Is everything all right?"
"Everything's fine. Better than fine, actually. But this new job has me working on a major project, and I can't take the time off right now."
"I see." Her disappointment was evident despite her attempt to hide it. "Well, work is important. I understand."
"I'm sorry, Mom. I really am."
"Don't apologize for doing well, sweetheart. I'm proud of you. It's just... this is only the second time you've missed Christmas."
Jay remembered the first time—his final year of college, when everything had felt impossible and he'd been too ashamed to explain why he couldn't afford the trip home. This felt entirely different.
"I know. I'll make it up to you."
"You don't need to make anything up. I just miss you."
"I miss you too."
They talked for a few more minutes about safe topics—the weather, his half-siblings' school activities. When they hung up, Jay felt both guilt and relief at getting out of family obligations. But tonight, the guilt felt manageable. He wasn't avoiding Christmas because he was struggling. He was choosing to spend it differently because he finally could.
The next morning, Jay walked to the shopping district with a specific mission. He'd decided to send gifts to his family. The prospect felt strange but pleasant—another indulgence he could now afford.
For his mother, he chose a bottle of perfume—bold and elegant. For his stepfather, a good bottle of whiskey, the sort that wouldn’t gather dust on the shelf. The choices seemed obvious and safe.
He hesitated a little longer over gifts for his siblings. For Ema, fifteen and already passionate about makeup, he picked out a set of quality brushes and a neutral eyeshadow palette—classic, nothing too trendy, but miles above the drugstore sets she probably used. For Tim, the oldest at seventeen and rarely indoors, he decided on a military grade multitool, sturdy enough for camping trips and after-school projects. For Ari, twelve and still fascinated by building things, he picked a building block set—the kind that promised a dozen different vehicles in one box.
He knew the gifts were more expensive than strictly necessary, but he didn’t mind. It wasn’t just about showing he was doing well now—though that was part of it. He wanted their holidays to be a little brighter, even if they’d all grown apart. Affection didn’t require closeness, sometimes it was just the effort to give something nice.
The sales clerk wrapped the gifts in festive paper. Jay planned to arrange delivery later, ensuring the packages would arrive in time.
Walking home with bags full of gifts, loaded down like a donkey, Jay realized the persistent discomfort that had shadowed him for months—the anxiety about money, about his place in the world, about whether he deserved good things—had mostly disappeared.
He couldn't pinpoint exactly when it had happened. Maybe it was the successful completion of the client crisis, or simply the accumulation of small victories that had built his confidence. Maybe it was the approaching holiday season, which had always held a special magic for him despite his complicated relationship with his family. Or maybe, Jay thought as he climbed the stairs to his apartment, life was finally looking up.
He unlocked his door and stepped inside, greeted by the gentle glow of his Christmas tree. The sight filled him with actual happiness. He made coffee and sat by the window, watching the city move below while his tree cast dancing shadows on the walls. The evergreen scent had grown stronger overnight, filling the apartment with the promise of celebration.
Scene 3
Christmas party
In the week that followed, the office entered into the frantic pace of the season—deadlines looming, inboxes swelling, but a sense of focus taking hold. Holiday anticipation crept in at the margins, just enough to soften the usual year-end rush.
Finally, on a Friday evening, the pace broke for the annual Christmas party. The restaurant buzzed with conversation and the clink of glasses as Turner & Associates' staff mingled around elegantly arranged standing tables. Jay adjusted his suit jacket, the same one he'd worn to every formal occasion, and surveyed the space. Chandeliers cast a gentle glow on winter greenery, and tables throughout the room were set with trays of food and drinks, inviting everyone to serve themselves.
"Jay!" Amy called from across the room, waving him over to where she stood with Kim and Zoe. "Come try the salmon canapés—they're incredible."
Jay made his way through the crowd, grabbing a glass of eggnog on his way. The restaurant had been completely reserved for the company, creating an intimate atmosphere.
"This place is amazing," Zoe said, gesturing around the room. "Turner Senior really outdid himself this year."
"He does every year," Kim replied, sampling a pastry. "Remember last year's party at that rooftop venue? I thought Ela was going to freeze to death."
"I survived," Ela said, appearing beside them with a plate of hors d'oeuvres. "Though I learned my lesson about outdoor December parties."
They chatted about the food, the decorations, and the year's successes. Jay sipped his eggnog, feeling the warmth of the alcohol ease him further into the evening. The opulent surroundings didn’t faze him anymore. He was relaxed, part of the group, and the sense of being an outsider had faded.
"Attention, everyone!" Turner Senior's voice reached across the room as he took position near the restaurant's central fireplace. The crowd gradually quieted and turned toward him.
"I want to thank you all for another exceptional year. When I started this company thirty years ago, I dreamed of building something that would stand the test of time. You've all exceeded those dreams."
He spoke about specific achievements, mentioning several team members by name, and outlined the company's impressive year-end projections. Jay felt pride as Turner Senior praised the team's ability to handle complex client situations and maintain their reputation for excellence.
"Now, before we continue enjoying this excellent meal, I have something for each of you." Turner Senior gestured to a table laden with beautifully wrapped baskets. "A small token of appreciation for your hard work and dedication."
The gifts were extraordinary—wicker baskets lined with silk and filled with imported chocolates, premium wines, artisanal cheeses, and various confectionery. Tucked into each basket was an envelope containing spa vouchers.
"Two full days at Serenity Springs Resort," Amy read from her voucher. "This is incredible."
Jay opened his own envelope and stared at the elegant certificate. The spa package was designed for couples, with treatments and accommodations clearly intended for two people. He felt heat rise in his face as he realized he had no one to bring.
"Who are you taking?" Zoe asked, showing off her own voucher.
"I'm not sure yet," Jay replied, hoping his voice sounded casual.
"I'm dragging my husband," Amy said. "He'll complain about the whole thing, but he'll secretly love it."
The conversation moved on to holiday plans as everyone returned to their food and drinks. Jay stood at the table with Ian, Max, Luc, and Ela, listening as they discussed their upcoming time off.
"My wife's parents booked us a house in the mountains," Max said, cutting into a piece of beef tenderloin. "A week of skiing and hot chocolate. I can't wait."
"Sounds exhausting," Luc replied with a grin. "I'm planning to sleep until noon every day and binge-watch terrible movies."
"I'm visiting my sister," Ela added. "She just had a baby, so I'll be playing aunt for a week."
"What about you, Jay?" Max asked. "Any exciting plans?"
"I'm staying home, actually. I need some rest after the hectic time I've had getting used to the new job."
"That sounds perfect," Luc said. "Sometimes the best vacation is no vacation at all."
The conversation moved to work coverage during the holiday period. It became clear that roughly half the team would be taking time off, leaving a smaller group to handle any urgent matters.
"So it'll be just us," Ela said, looking around the table. "Ian, Jay, Luc, and me. I hope everyone else works hard to finish all the major tasks before they disappear."
"We always manage," Ian replied. "The holiday period is usually quieter anyway."
Jay was curious about Ian's own plans but didn't dare ask directly. Ian hadn't mentioned any travel or family gatherings, and Jay wondered if the topic was off-limits.
As the evening progressed, the atmosphere grew more relaxed. Groups formed and reformed as people moved between tables, sharing stories and laughing over the excellent food. Jay no longer felt like the nervous newcomer worried about saying the wrong thing.
The crowd began to thin as the evening wound down. Some employees had families to return to, others had made dinner plans elsewhere. Jay was preparing to leave when Leo appeared at his elbow.
"Jay, good to see you enjoying yourself. I trust you're prepared for the holiday work schedule?"
"Of course," Jay replied curtly.
"Excellent. You'll need to take good care of Ian during that time. He always works through the holidays—never really had any family plans, you know. Estranged from his relatives and all that. I'm glad you'll be there to keep him company."
Jay felt a flash of irritation at Leo's presumptuous tone. "I'm sure Ian can take care of himself. He managed perfectly well before I arrived."
Leo raised an eyebrow at Jay's sharp response. "Just looking out for a friend, Jay. No need to get defensive."
"I'm not defensive," Jay replied, though he could hear the edge in his own voice. "I'm just not particularly interested in your insights about office dynamics."
Leo smiled. "Fair enough. Have a good evening, Jay."
Jay still hadn't forgiven Leo, and the casual way Leo discussed Ian's personal life bothered him. But beneath his irritation, Jay felt concern for Ian.
The image of Ian working alone through the holidays, with no family to visit and no plans beyond the office, struck Jay as profoundly sad. He thought of his own small apartment with its tiny Christmas tree, and wondered what Ian's holidays looked like.
Jay collected his gift basket and said his goodbyes, thanking Turner Senior for the generous evening. As he walked to the metro, he thought not about his own holiday plans, but about Ian's solitary Christmas.
The spa voucher felt heavy in his pocket, a reminder of experiences designed for sharing that he would likely never use. But more than that, it reminded him that he wasn't the only one who would be spending the holidays alone.
Scene 4
Holidays
The week following the party brought a surge of pre-holiday urgency. Everyone rushed to complete projects and tie up loose ends before the office closed for Christmas. Jay stayed late most nights, helping process year-end reports and ensuring client communications were current. Work on the annual reports had started in mid-December and was expected to continue through the first half of January, with everyone putting in overtime in a tense atmosphere.
"This is insane," Luc muttered, sorting through a stack of documents. "Why does everyone suddenly remember they need things done right before Christmas?"
"Same reason people shop on Christmas Eve," Ela replied, not looking up from her computer. "Poor planning and magical thinking."
Jay had spent his lunch break the previous day at the post office, shipping packages to his family. He'd divided the contents of his gift basket—the spa voucher went to his mother and stepfather, the chocolates and artisanal cookies to his half-siblings, while he kept the wine and aged cheeses for himself. The gesture felt right, a way to share his good fortune without the complicated emotions of an actual visit.
By Wednesday afternoon, the office atmosphere turned celebratory. People packed up their desks and exchanged final Christmas wishes before heading home to their families.
"Amy, have a wonderful time with your parents," Ian said, approaching her desk. "Give them my regards."
Amy stood and surprised him with a quick hug. "Merry Christmas, Ian. Try to enjoy yourself."
Ian accepted the embrace with good grace, though Jay noticed the slight stiffness in his posture. He moved through the office systematically, offering handshakes and holiday wishes to each team member.
"Max, enjoy the skiing. Don't break anything important."
"Luc, get some rest. You've earned it."
"Ela, safe travels. I'm sure your sister will appreciate the help."
Jay watched with growing anticipation, his pulse quickening as Ian approached his desk. When Ian finally reached him, Jay got up and extended his hand.
"Merry Christmas, Jay. Thank you for your excellent work this year."
Their hands met in a firm handshake, and Jay felt an electric current run through the contact. Ian's grip was sure, his skin warm against Jay's palm. For a moment that stretched longer than it should have, neither man moved to break the connection.
"Thank you," Jay replied, his voice slightly breathless. "For everything. For giving me this opportunity."
Ian's eyes held his for a beat longer than necessary before he released Jay's hand. "You've more than earned your place here."
Jay felt heat rise in his face at the praise. "I'll see you soon," he said, gathering his things.
"Indeed. Enjoy your holiday, Jay."
The metro ride home felt dreamlike. Jay replayed the handshake over and over, the memory of Ian's touch lingering on his skin. He told himself he was reading too much into a simple gesture, but the flutter in his chest suggested otherwise.
Christmas was gray. Jay had slept late, luxuriating in the freedom from alarm clocks and schedules. He made coffee and sat by his small tree, watching the city wake up through his apartment window.
The cheese platter he assembled for lunch was a work of art—aged cheddar, creamy brie, and sharp blue cheese arranged on a wooden board with crackers and grapes. The wine he'd selected was rich and complex, far better than anything he'd ever purchased for himself.
"This is living," he said aloud, raising his glass to the empty apartment.
His phone rang as he was preparing dinner—a simple but elegant meal of herb-crusted salmon, roasted vegetables, and rice pilaf.
"Jay!" his mother's voice was bright with excitement. "I had to call and thank you for the gifts. You really shouldn't have."
"It's nothing, Mom. Just some things from work."
"The spa voucher is incredible. Your stepfather keeps complaining about it, but I caught him reading the brochure three times."
Jay laughed. "Tell him it's a company gift and I'm way too busy to use it myself. He'll have to suffer through a weekend of massages and gourmet meals."
"The kids love their presents too. Ema's been doing her eyes nonstop, and Ari has already assembled two of the vehicles."
They talked for another twenty minutes, his mother updating him on family matters. When they hung up, Jay felt a surge of affection free of the tension that plagued his relationship with his family lately.
The evening passed pleasantly. Jay opened another bottle of wine, savored his meal, and watched a Christmas movie on his laptop. The apartment felt cozy and warm, his small tree glowing in the corner.
He thought briefly about Ian, wondering how he was spending the evening, but pushed the thought away. Whatever Ian's holiday looked like, it wasn't Jay's concern.
Meanwhile, across the city, Ian sat in his pristine home office, reviewing reports that could easily have waited until January. His penthouse was elegant and spotless, unmarked by any hint of seasonal decoration. The only acknowledgement of the holiday was the expensive bottle of scotch he'd opened.
He worked  through financial projections and client assessments, using the task to quiet his thoughts. The office would be closed for two days, but Ian had never seen much point in artificial celebrations.
Christmas had lost its meaning for him years ago, when his family's rejection had stripped away the warmth and tradition he'd once associated with the season. Now it was simply another date on the calendar, notable only for its inconvenience to business operations.
He paused in his work to refill his glass, thinking briefly about Jay's enthusiastic "see you soon" from the day before. The young man's obvious excitement about returning to work was both touching and puzzling. Ian couldn't remember the last time he'd looked forward to anything with such anticipation.
The memory of their handshake surfaced—Jay's palm warm against his, the brief moment of connection that had lasted a heartbeat too long. Ian forced the thought away and returned to his reports.
He worked until well past midnight, as he always did on Christmas Eve. The silence of his penthouse felt safe, unmarked by the messy emotions that holidays seemed to bring others.
As he finally prepared for bed, Ian caught sight of his reflection in the bathroom mirror. The man looking back at him appeared tired, someone who had forgotten how to feel the simple joy that had once made Christmas magical.
He doubted he would ever feel that kind of happiness again, the uncomplicated pleasure of anticipation and celebration. Those feelings belonged to a different version of himself, one that had disappeared along with his family's acceptance and his capacity for trust.
But somewhere in the city, Jay Hall was falling asleep with a smile on his face, content and already looking forward to returning to work. The contrast between their experiences would have struck Ian as poignant, if he'd allowed himself to consider it.
Instead, he simply turned off the lights and prepared for another day of productive solitude.
Scene 5
Dream
Ian dreamed of warmth.
Jay's body pressed against his on the leather couch in his office, the younger man's gray eyes wide with wonder and an adoration that made Ian's chest tighten. Jay's hands trembled as they touched Ian's face, fingers mapping the angular planes of his features.
"I can't believe this is real," Jay whispered. "I can't believe you want me."
Ian cupped Jay's face, thumbs stroking across his pale cheeks. "Always," he murmured, drawing him closer. "From the moment you walked into my office."
Their lips met in a kiss that was tender and hesitant, Jay's mouth opening under his with a small sound of surprise. Ian kissed him slowly, savouring the sweetness, the way Jay melted against him with complete trust. Jay pulled Ian closer with desperate need.
"Please," Jay breathed against his lips. "I've wanted this for so long."
Ian's mouth moved to Jay's throat, pressing gentle kisses to the sensitive skin there. Jay's pulse raced under his lips, and Ian unbuttoned the top two buttons of Jay's shirt, revealing the pale column of his neck. Jay arched beneath him, trembling with want.
"Ian," Jay gasped, his voice breaking. "I'm so happy. I never thought... I never imagined you could feel this way about me."
Ian held him like something precious, something that might disappear if he gripped too tightly. Jay's skin was warm and smooth under his hands, and the sounds he made drove Ian to madness. This was everything he'd forbidden himself to want, everything he'd pushed away—
Ian's eyes snapped open.
His bedroom was dark and cold, the dream dissolving like smoke. His heart hammered against his ribs, and his breathing came in sharp, uneven gasps. The phantom sensation of Jay's mouth lingered on his lips, the memory of his weight in Ian's arms so vivid it felt like a physical loss.
Ian sat up, running his hands through his hair. The profound emptiness that followed the dream overwhelmed him. For a moment, he'd been happy—truly, completely happy—and now reality brutally crashed back.
He was alone. He was always alone.
Ian checked his phone. Three in the morning. The apartment felt suffocating, filled with the ghost of something he could never have.
He thought about how long it had been since he'd allowed anyone close. Years. He'd convinced himself that solitude was strength, that independence was safety. But apparently isolation was exacting its own price.
Jay's face rose in his mind—those wide gray eyes, the curve of his mouth. He was so beautiful that it made Ian's chest ache, sweet and honest and utterly untouchable.
Ian forced himself to stop. These thoughts were dangerous, useless. He couldn't start harbouring such fantasies about Jay. That path led only to pain—for both of them.
He grabbed his phone and scrolled to Leo's number. Leo had orchestrated this entire situation, bringing Jay into Ian's life with his meddling. Ian had tolerated it, but now he needed to express his displeasure properly.
The phone rang eleven times before Leo answered, his voice thick with sleep.
"Ian? Christ, what time is it? Is everything okay?"
"Tennis tomorrow. Nine o'clock."
"What? Ian, it's three in the morning. Are you drunk?"
"Nine o'clock," Ian repeated, his tone brooking no argument. "Don't be late."
"Are you out of your mind? It's the middle of the night, and it's December. The courts will be freezing."
"I don't care. I'll see you at nine."
Ian hung up before Leo could protest further.
The tennis courts were nearly empty on a gray December morning. Leo arrived looking disheveled and deeply annoyed, clutching a travel mug of coffee.
"This is insane," Leo muttered, stretching halfheartedly. "It's freezing out here. We're going to get frostbite."
Ian was already warming up. "You'll survive."
"What's gotten into you? You call me at three in the morning demanding tennis, and now you look like you want to murder someone."
"Serve," Ian commanded, taking his position.
Leo served weakly, still grumbling about the early hour. Ian returned the ball with viciousness, sending it flying past Leo's racket.
"Jesus, Ian! What was that?"
"Fifteen-love."
The next serve met the same fate. And the next. Within minutes, Leo was running frantically around the court, diving for shots that Ian accurately placed. Ian showed no mercy, driving Leo from corner to corner.
"This is torture," Leo gasped after losing the first set six games to love. "You're playing like you're trying to kill me."
"Second set," Ian replied, spinning his racket.
"Can we at least take a break? I'm dying here."
"We're playing."
Leo bent over his knees, breathing heavily. "This isn't tennis. This is some kind of sadistic punishment. What did I do?"
Ian's return shot nearly took Leo's head off. "You know what you did."
"I honestly don't! If this is about work, we can discuss it like civilized people over coffee."
Ian's next shot forced Leo to sprint to the baseline, where he stumbled and nearly fell. "This isn't about work."
"Then what?" Leo retrieved the ball and trudged back to the service line. "Did I forget your birthday? Insult your mother? Sleep with your imaginary boyfriend?" Leo paused, racket halfway through his serving motion. "Is it about Jay?"
Ian's look could have frozen water.
"He's doing great work, everyone likes him, he's fitting in perfectly. What's the problem?"
Ian's return shot landed inches from Leo's feet. "The problem is your meddling."
"My meddling?" Leo's voice rose to a squeak. "You mean hiring him? You approved that!"
"I approved hiring an assistant. I didn't approve hiring..." Ian paused, searching for words that wouldn't reveal too much. "Someone like him."
"Someone like what? Competent? Hardworking? Good-looking?"
Ian's racket connected with the ball so hard it sounded like a gunshot. Leo dove sideways, barely avoiding being hit.
"Are you trying to kill me?"
"Keep playing."
They continued for another hour, Leo growing increasingly bedraggled while Ian maintained his ruthless pace. By the time they finished, Leo looked like he'd been through a blender.
"Three hours," Leo gasped, collapsing onto a bench. "Three hours of this torture. I can't feel my legs."
Ian toweled off his face, his expression still severe. "Perhaps you'll think twice before your next scheme."
"What scheme? I hired you an assistant! A good assistant! He's perfect for the job!"
"That's the problem."
Leo stared at him for a long moment, understanding dawning in his eyes. "Oh. Oh, Ian. You like him. Actually like him. And it's freaking you out."
Ian's expression went glacial. "Don't be ridiculous."
"That's why you're punishing me with arctic tennis at the crack of dawn. You're attracted to your assistant and you're blaming me for it."
"I'm not attracted to anyone."
"Right. And that's why you just spent three hours trying to murder me with a tennis ball."
"This conversation is over."
"Ian, wait." Leo struggled to his feet. "Look, I know you're scared. After Sam, I understand why you don't trust—"
"Don't." Ian's voice was deadly quiet. "Don't mention Sam. And don't pretend you understand anything about my situation."
"I'm just saying, maybe it's time to consider that not everyone is out to hurt you."
Ian shouldered his bag and walked toward the exit. "Thank you for the tennis match, Leo. It was exactly what I needed."
"Ian!"
But Ian was already gone, leaving Leo standing alone on the frozen court, with bruised ego and aching muscles.
As Ian drove home, he felt marginally better. The physical exertion had burned off some of his restless energy, and Leo's suffering had provided a satisfying outlet for his frustration. But the underlying problem remained. Jay would be back at work tomorrow, with his earnest eyes and his gentle smile, and Ian would have to pretend that everything was exactly as it should be.
Chapter 9: New Year
Scene 1
After the holidays
The office felt different after the holidays, with most of the desks empty and the usual bustle absent. Jay arrived earlier than necessary, energized and eager.
"Good morning," Jay said as he passed Ian's office, surprised that his boss was already at his desk.
Ian looked up from his computer. "Good morning, Jay. I trust you had a pleasant holiday?"
"Very pleasant, thank you. Quiet and restful." Jay hesitated in the doorway. "How was your Christmas?"
"Productive." Ian's tone offered no invitation for further inquiry. "I've prepared a list of priority items for this week. With our reduced staff, we'll need to focus on essential tasks."
"Of course. I'm ready."
Jay sat at his desk with renewed purpose. The break had done him good. He felt clear-headed, approaching each task with focus.
Only a skeleton crew remained during the week between Christmas and New Year's, and even that had been reduced when Ela called in sick with the flu that morning, her voice hoarse and apologetic over the phone.  
"Don't worry about it," Ian had told her. "Rest and recover properly. We'll manage."
Luc arrived an hour later, looking considerably less energetic. "This place is like a ghost town."
"Ela called in sick this morning—caught the flu." Jay replied. 
"So it's just the three of us? This should be interesting."
The morning passed smoothly despite their reduced numbers. Jay worked through client correspondence while Ian handled the more complex enquiries. 
Luc emerged from the open space looking slightly overwhelmed. "Thank God you're both here. I've got three client reports that need to be finished by Friday, and Ela was supposed to handle most of them."
"I can take on the market analysis," Jay offered immediately. "I've been studying the proper formats."  
Ian watched Jay's eager expression and felt a tightness in his chest. The young man's recovery was remarkable—he'd regained that bright, determined look that had initially caught Ian's attention. But Ian's own reaction to that enthusiasm now felt dangerous.  
"That would be great," Ian said. "I'll review the parameters with you."  
Jay worked diligently, asking questions and tackling complex data into clear reports. Ian fought the urge to watch him too closely.
Every instinct screamed at Ian to maintain distance. The dream from the night before had left him wary, hyperaware of every casual interaction. But he also recognized that Jay's confidence remained fragile despite his improved mood. One careless gesture could undo months of progress.  So Ian forced himself to be patient and accommodating, answering Jay's questions thoroughly. The effort was exhausting—like walking a tightrope while pretending everything was normal.
By lunchtime, it became clear that the workload would be manageable but demanding. Jay volunteered to take on additional responsibilities, preparing reports that would typically be distributed among the full team.
By late afternoon, Luc had finished his assignments and was preparing to leave. "I'm heading out," he announced, gathering his things. "My girlfriend's cooking dinner, and I don't want to be late."
"Have a good evening," Ian replied, not looking up from his computer.
"Don't work too hard, you two. The world won't end if something waits until tomorrow."
As Luc's footsteps faded down the corridor, Jay glanced at the remaining work on his desk. His analysis was nearly complete, but Ian still had several client summaries to review.
"I can stay late and help with those," Jay said, gesturing toward Ian's stack of documents. "It's not like I have anywhere else to be."
"That's not necessary," Ian replied quickly. "I can manage it."
"Please, let me help. I want to contribute."  
Ian looked at Jay's earnest expression and felt his resolve waver. He could see the importance this held for Jay—the chance to prove himself useful, to be trusted with meaningful work. Refusing would likely hurt Jay's feelings.  
"All right," Ian said finally.
The next few hours passed quickly. They worked in silence, Jay at his desk while Ian remained in his office. The building grew quieter as everyone else left and the cleaning crew finished their rounds.
Jay had stayed late before, but almost always with other people present. The current situation felt different—since no one else was there, it felt more intimate. The warm glow of the Christmas lights in the corridor cast everything in a softer light.
Jay worked through a stack of client summaries, but he couldn't shake the awareness of Ian across the room. They were alone together like never before—no colleagues nearby, no interruptions from the office activity.
"Jay." Ian's voice made him look up. "Could you review these projections? I want to ensure the calculations are accurate before I submit them."
Jay accepted the documents, their fingers brushing briefly as the papers changed hands. The contact lasted only a moment, but Jay felt his skin burn at the touch.
"Of course," he said, hoping his voice sounded steadier than he felt.
As Jay worked through the projections, he was acutely aware of Ian returning to his desk, the sound of his chair, the rustle of papers being organized. The office felt simultaneously vast and cramped, as if they were occupying a private space carved out from the larger corporate world.
Jay discovered something unexpected as the evening progressed: he trusted Ian. Not just as a supervisor, but as a man. The realization struck him as he worked through the data—he felt entirely safe with Ian, protected by his integrity.
Under normal circumstances, being alone in an office with a senior manager would have made him anxious. His previous experience had taught him to be wary of men in positions of power, to expect the worst from such situations. But with Ian, that fear simply didn't exist. Jay couldn't explain the certainty he felt about Ian's character—they didn't know each other well, they had shared few personal conversations. Yet Jay trusted him implicitly.
The trust was absolute and unquestioning, a feeling Jay hadn't experienced with anyone in years. Ian could ask him to do anything, and Jay would comply without hesitation, confident that the request would be reasonable and appropriate.
This certainty should have been comforting, but instead it made Jay's pulse quicken. He trusted Ian not to take advantage, not to make him uncomfortable, not to use his position inappropriately. It was a level of faith Jay hadn't experienced since starting his career. But the intimacy of the moment also made his skin tingle. The quiet office, the warm lighting, the sense of being alone together—it created an atmosphere that felt charged, even though Jay knew nothing would happen.
Jay forced himself to focus on the documents, but his awareness of Ian remained constant. Through the windows, the city lights twinkled like earthbound stars, and Jay felt as though they were suspended in a moment outside of normal time.
He glanced up to find Ian watching him with an unreadable expression. For a heartbeat, neither man looked away, then Ian returned to his work, and Jay did the same. But the air in the office vibrated with tension that Jay couldn't identify.
Scene 2
Before New Year
As the week progressed, Jay threw himself into his work with determination, driven by a desire to make Ian's workload as manageable as possible. After nearly five months at Turner & Associates, he'd developed some expertise in the company's basic operations and client needs.
His evenings at home had been spent studying client portfolios and industry standards, and the investment was paying off. Jay could now manage simple reports and handle standard client correspondence with minimal supervision. He was reserving only the most crucial assignments for Ian.
"You're a godsend," Luc said on Wednesday morning, watching Jay organize the day's priorities. "Without you, I'd probably be sleeping in the office."
Ian observed Jay's initiative, not just in organization but in the matters that drove their business. His reports were clear and his instincts increasingly sound.
Jay stayed late every evening, working through tasks that would have otherwise fallen to Ian. One evening, as the office began to empty out, Ian paused by Jay’s desk.
“It’s the holiday season, Jay. You should head home and get some rest."
"When I get home, I study the work materials anyway," Jay said, not looking up from his computer. "It doesn't matter to me if I'm in the office a bit longer."
Ian shook his head in resignation. He recognized the pattern—the complete absorption in work that left no room for personal life. He didn't want Jay to become like him, a monk married to the job, but he was hardly in a position to criticize.
The lunch routine changed organically. With most of the team gone, Jay and Luc abandoned the group outings to restaurants. The weather was brutal, and neither felt motivated to venture outside for extended periods.
"I grabbed sandwiches from that bakery nearby," Jay announced, holding up a paper bag. "Turkey club and roast beef. Take your pick."
"Lifesaver," Luc replied, accepting the turkey club. "I was dreading another frozen walk to find food."
They ate in the office kitchen, a space Jay had rarely used for eating before. Ian appeared at his usual lunch hour, retrieving a container from the refrigerator and heating it in the microwave.
"Mind if I join you?" Ian asked, though he was already sitting down at the small table.
"Of course," Jay said, but he felt suddenly self-conscious about his lunch.
The conversation was stilted at first. Ian was private even during breaks, never discussing personal matters or revealing much about his life outside the office. But Jay enjoyed seeing this different side of his boss—less formal, more human.
"What does Ian eat?" Jay asked on Luc, realizing he'd never paid attention to his boss's meal habits.
"Ian has a personal meal service. Everything prepared according to optimal macros and delivered fresh."
Jay looked up, surprised. “Seriously? I thought he just skipped meals.”
Luc laughed. "Does he look like someone who skips meals? He's a gym rat. Working out is basically the only thing he does besides work. Very disciplined about it."
Jay took in the information with interest. He'd never thought about Ian's life outside the office, but now he watchem him more carefully. It was entirely possible that he was actually quite muscular beneath those tailored clothes. The broad shoulders, the way he held himself—it all supported Luc's observation.
Jay also identified the sleek containers in the office refrigerator. Each meal was portioned exactly, the contents clearly optimized for nutrition.
As New Year's Eve approached, the three of them worked closer than ever. Several last-minute client emergencies tested their coordination, but they handled each situation smoothly. Jay felt his confidence soaring with each successful resolution.
The work was meaningful, bringing him satisfaction unlike anything he'd experienced before. He began to understand why some people became workaholics—there was something deeply fulfilling about performing duties to the highest standard and seeing tangible results.
Jay looked toward Ian's office and felt a new understanding of his boss. Perhaps Ian felt this same fulfillment, this sense of purpose that made long hours feel worthwhile.
The last day before New Year was notably calmer. Client correspondence had slowed to a trickle, and their major assignments were complete. The entire financial district switched into celebratory mode.
Around four o'clock, Ian surprised both Jay and Luc by appearing at their desks.
"Would you join me in my office?"
They followed him, exchanging curious glances. Ian moved to the credenza where he kept a selection of glasses and a bottle of whiskey Jay had never noticed before.
"I thought we should toast the year," Ian said, pouring three generous measures. "It's been particularly successful."
Luc accepted his glass eagerly, but Jay hesitated. "I'm not sure this is entirely appropriate—"
Ian laughed, a sound that softened his entire demeanor. "We're done with our work, and we'll all be leaving momentarily. Even I won't stay late today. If it were truly improper, I wouldn't keep alcohol and glasses in my office in the first place."
Jay accepted his glass, still uncertain but charmed by Ian’s unexpected warmth. He had never seen Ian laugh this way—not the polite smile, but genuine joy. He had a feeling this moment would stay with him for a long time.
"To a successful year," Ian said, raising his glass.
"To surviving the holidays," Luc added with a grin.
They drank, and Luc immediately looked impressed. "This is excellent whiskey."
"It's actually my best bottle," Ian admitted.  
Luc went pale. "How best are we talking?"  
"Best enough that you should savor it, not gulp it."  
Jay sipped his whiskey and immediately made a face. "I never understood hard liquor."
Both men laughed at his expression, and Jay felt a warm thread of connection despite his distaste for the drink. He persevered, drinking stubbornly while continuing to grimace.
"It's an acquired taste," Ian said. "Wine is more forgiving for beginners."
"What do you usually drink?" Jay asked, emboldened by the alcohol and the relaxed atmosphere.
"Scotch, mostly. Sometimes bourbon. I prefer aged spirits—they have more complexity."
Ian explained the differences between various whiskeys, his passion for the subject evident in his detailed descriptions. Jay listened intently, fascinated by this glimpse into Ian's personal preferences.
The conversation continued for another twenty minutes, all three men feeling closer after the intense week they'd shared. Even Ian was more at ease, the initial tension from his dream having subsided. He'd regained confidence in his ability to compartmentalize his attraction.
Jay radiated happiness. The innocence in his expression touched something in Ian's chest, a warmth he didn't dare examine too closely.
When their drinks were finished, Ian got up, offering a brief farewell. "Happy New Year, Jay," Ian said, extending his hand. "Thank you for everything this week."
Jay shook his hand, looking a little embarrassed. “Happy New Year, Ian. I’m glad I could be useful.”
Jay left the office that evening feeling fulfilled and secure. Despite everything, this had been a good year. Challenging and not free from drama, but ultimately strengthening.
He felt truly blessed, and even his initial anger at Leo had faded. The man's meddling had actually resulted in something wonderful.
On impulse, Jay sent a message to Leo's company phone: "Happy New Year. You are forgiven."
Across town at an upscale party, Leo read the message and grinned. Combined with Ian's recent tennis-related tantrum, things were clearly progressing in the right direction.
Jay spent New Year's Eve alone in his apartment, watching fireworks bloom across the city skyline at midnight. He felt good—genuinely, deeply good.
In his own apartment, Ian stood at his window watching the same fireworks. He felt a similar contentment, a sense that the year had brought positive change.
Both men thought about each other as the new year began, and for once, these thoughts were warm and hopeful, not complicated by doubt or fear.
Scene 3
Bonus
The first week of January brought Turner & Associates back to life at full throttle, the year-start chaos intensified by the dual demands of annual and quarterly reports. Ela was still home recovering from the flu, Kim was on vacation for another week, and the smaller team meant no one had time to ease into the new year. Jay arrived earlier than usual on his first day back, only to find Ian already in his office with the door ajar, a half-empty coffee cup beside him and several files open on his desk.
"Good morning,” Jay said as he passed.  
Ian glanced up from a document. “Good morning. I trust you had a good holiday?”  
“I did, thank you. I hope yours was restful.”  
“It was,” Ian replied, before turning back to his work.
Jay's tasks felt comfortable now, second nature after months of practice. At eleven-thirty, his computer chimed with a new email. The subject line read: "Year-End Performance and Bonus Announcement." Jay opened it immediately.
"Team,
I want to congratulate everyone on an exceptional year. Turner & Associates has achieved record-breaking performance across all sectors, exceeding our targets by significant margins. This success is a result of your dedication, expertise, and collaborative efforts.
Year-end bonuses have been processed and will appear in your accounts shortly. These amounts reflect not only our financial success but also your individual contributions to our achievements.
I look forward to building on this momentum in the coming year.
Best regards, Ian Hagen Chief Financial Officer"
Jay read the message, then checked his phone for bank notifications. Nothing yet. He wondered what constituted a bonus at a firm like Turner & Associates. His previous job had given modest holiday bonuses—enough for a nice dinner or a small gift at best. Other firms had weeks of waiting, sometimes months, for accounting to finalize numbers and senior partners to approve distributions. It felt like that could only be explained by Ian’s standards, applied to himself before anyone else.
He tried to focus on his work, but kept checking his phone every few minutes. Around noon, the notification finally arrived.
Jay stared at the screen, dumbfounded. The number couldn't be right. Eighty thousand. For a second, he thought it had to be eight thousand, something generous but still plausible. He counted the digits again: one, two, three, four, five. Five digits. More money than he'd ever seen in his account at once.
He stood abruptly, then sat back down. This amount could change everything. In a couple of months, he could make a down payment on an apartment—not just any apartment, but a decent one in a good neighbourhood. The possibility felt surreal.
Jay walked quickly to Luc's desk, where his colleague was typing with unusual enthusiasm.
"Luc, could I ask you something?"
Luc looked up, grinning. "Let me guess. You got your bonus notification and think there's been a mistake."
"Well... yes. There has to be an error."
"No error. Welcome to the real benefits of working in big finance. When the year is good, the bonus is mind-blowing. And this year was spectacular."
Jay glanced around the office. Max was on the phone, gesturing excitedly as he spoke. "I'm thinking the Maldives this time," he was saying. "Maybe that resort with the overwater bungalows." Zoe sat at her desk with a grin, apparently running numbers for apartment searches.
Amy walked past with a stack of files, looking pleased. "Congratulations, Jay," she said. "First bonus at Turner & Associates?"
"Yes, and apparently last, because I think I'm having a heart attack."
She laughed. "You'll get used to it. Though I hope you never take it for granted."
"I don't think that's possible," Jay said.
"So what's the plan? New apartment? Fancy car? Month-long vacation?" Luc asked.
"I honestly don't know. I never expected anything like this."
"Well, you earned it. Ian doesn't give bonuses out of charity."
Jay felt a warm flush of pride. "It still feels unreal."
"Enjoy it," Luc said. "You've been working hard. You deserve to celebrate."
Jay returned to his desk, still processing the morning's revelation. He opened his laptop and began researching apartment listings, then stopped himself. Moving felt premature. This windfall could disappear as quickly as it had appeared. Markets fluctuated, jobs ended, and he'd learned not to trust good fortune too completely.
But he could make some smaller improvements. His wardrobe, for instance. He'd been wearing the same rotation of modest clothes for months, carefully maintaining them to extend their life. His colleagues dressed impeccably, and while no one had ever commented on his appearance, he sometimes felt self-conscious about the gap in quality.
Jay made a decision. He would upgrade his work wardrobe—nothing extravagant, but a definite improvement. Three new suits, properly tailored, that would help him feel more confident.
After lunch, he researched tailors in the city centre. He found a well-reviewed boutique within walking distance that specialized in business attire. It wasn’t a place that built suits from scratch. Most of their pieces were ready-made, adjusted to fit each client, but that suited him just fine. It was a world apart from the department-store racks he’d relied on so far. 
The fittings could be done in a single visit, with alterations ready in about a week. The prices were reasonable, especially considering his unexpected financial cushion. He decided not to stay late that day and to visit it immediately, suspecting the workload in the coming days would be even more unforgiving, and doubting he would have the time.
The boutique occupied a narrow storefront. Inside, the atmosphere was quiet, with racks of suits in rich fabrics and a small seating area near the fitting rooms.
A middle-aged man approached as Jay entered. "Good afternoon. How can I help you?"
"I'm looking for three business suits," Jay said. "Nothing too flashy, but well-made."
The man nodded approvingly. "Excellent choice. Quality pieces that will serve you well. Let me show you some options."
For the next hour, Jay tried on suits in navy, gray, and a subtle pinstripe. The tailor took measurements, discussing fabric choices and fit preferences. Jay selected conservative styles that would complement his existing wardrobe while elevating his overall appearance.
"These will be ready in ten days," the tailor said as Jay completed his payment. "You'll find the improvement in confidence is worth the investment."
Walking to the metro, he felt good. Finally he wouldn't worry about standing out for the wrong reasons. The suits wouldn't make him equal to his colleagues' backgrounds or education, but they would eliminate one source of self-consciousness. The new year had begun with unexpected generosity, and Jay was determined to make the most of it.
Scene 4
Friday evening reflections
The days that followed were relentless. New projects launched alongside the backlog from the break, and with both the quarterly and annual reports due, there was little room to breathe. Ian was at his desk before Jay arrived each morning and still there after he left in the evenings. Jay’s own workload felt heavier than December’s, each task flowing into the next without pause. Lunch hours vanished, everyone ate at their desks, picking at takeout while answering emails. The printers ran constantly, conference calls overlapped.
Eventually Ela returned from her sick leave with dramatic stories about her recovery and Kim came back from his extended vacation with a deep tan and a collection of choice observations about tropical tourist destinations. The office felt complete again.
Despite the workload, the end-of-year gala dominated conversations throughout the building. Jay overheard snippets of planning discussions everywhere—in the elevator, during coffee breaks, over lunch. The venue this year was apparently the Grand Hotel, with its famous ballroom. Amy mentioned shopping for a new dress, while Max debated between his black tuxedo and charcoal formal wear.
"Have you picked up your tuxedo yet?" Zoe asked Jay during a brief break between meetings.
"Not yet," Jay said. "I should probably collect it this weekend."
The prospect of attending such an elegant gathering still felt surreal, but his growing confidence made it seem less intimidating than it once would have.
By the end of the week, the quarterly reports were finished. The pace eased marginally, though the annual reports and early-year planning kept everyone busy. Still, Monday brought the return of the team’s lunch outings. The weather was bitter, but the change of scenery was welcome. The pasta place, the sushi bar, the bistro with its onion soup, and Jay’s favourite Willow & Sage were all back in rotation.
"The weather's brutal," Luc said during lunch, warming his hands around a cup of coffee. "I'm ready for spring already."
"At least it's not snowing," Amy replied. "Remember last January? We were practically trapped in the office for two weeks."
"That was actually productive," Max said. "Nothing like a blizzard to eliminate distractions."
Jay listened to the banter, appreciating how naturally he'd become part of these conversations. The awkwardness of his early weeks felt like a distant memory. 
Friday afternoon brought a sense of completion as the week's projects wrapped up. Jay finished organizing Ian's calendar for the following week and compiled the status reports that would be distributed Monday morning. The office gradually emptied as people prepared for the weekend.
"Hey Jay," Luc said, stopping by his desk as he gathered his coat. "Feel like grabbing drinks? There's a new place downtown that's supposed to have decent craft beer."
Jay looked up from his computer, considering the invitation. Luc had been asking regularly, and Jay had consistently declined with polite but vague excuses.
"Thanks, but I'll pass," Jay said. "I appreciate the invitation though."
"Come on, it's Friday. Live a little."
Jay paused, then decided to be honest. "Pubs overwhelm me, to be completely frank. I'd rather avoid them if possible."
Luc raised an eyebrow, then grinned. "Fair enough. Though you realize you'll still have to attend on special occasions, right? Work celebrations, that sort of thing."
"I suppose I'll manage when necessary," Jay said with a slight smile.
"We'll ease you into it gradually. Start with quiet wine bars, work our way up to actual chaos."
Jay laughed. "I'll keep that in mind."
After Luc left, Jay finished his remaining tasks and prepared to leave. The office felt peaceful in the early evening light, most desks empty except for the occasional colleague working late. Ian's office light was still on, but he decided not to disturb him.
Since the team had returned to full strength and the quarterly reports were done, Jay no longer needed to stay late every day. The consistent overtime of December had become unnecessary, leaving him with free afternoons. Strangely, he missed those quiet hours when the office emptied and he could focus completely on his work while Ian handled urgent matters in the adjacent office.
Jay collected his coat and headed home, stepping into the crisp January air. The city felt different in winter. People moved with purpose, bundled against the cold but undeterred by it.
Back at his apartment, Jay hung up his coat and surveyed the space. The small Christmas tree still stood in the corner, though he'd planned to pack it away. It felt reassuring, a reminder of how much had changed in the past months.
He made dinner and ate while reviewing the day's events. The routine of office life had become so natural that he sometimes forgot how foreign it had once seemed.
As evening deepened, Jay got restless. He cleaned up the dinner dishes, then finally dismantled the Christmas tree, packing away the ornaments for next year. The task felt both melancholy and hopeful, marking the end of one chapter and the beginning of another.
He sat by the window with a cup of tea, watching the city lights emerge in the darkness. Usually, he enjoyed these quiet moments in his apartment, the solitude providing a necessary counterbalance to the day's social interactions. Tonight, however, the silence felt different—not peaceful, but empty.
Jay wondered if Ian was still at the office. It was past eight o'clock, late even by Ian's standards, but not unprecedented. The man seemed to find comfort in work, using it as both challenge and refuge. Jay understood the appeal, having experienced it himself during the busiest weeks of December.
The thought of Ian working alone in the office stirred something in Jay's chest—not pity, but a kind of sympathetic understanding. They shared a preference for solitude, but perhaps that preference masked a long buried need for connection.
Jay considered returning to the office, ostensibly to collect something he'd forgotten, but dismissed the idea as transparent. Ian valued his privacy, and Jay respected that.
Instead, he thought about gym memberships. The idea had never appealed to him before—he'd always preferred leisurely activities like reading or walking. But knowing that Ian enjoyed physical exercise made the prospect more interesting. Not because he wanted to impress Ian, but because he was curious about experiences that brought Ian fulfilment.
Jay opened his laptop and researched fitness centres in his neighbourhood. The variety was overwhelming—yoga studios, boxing gyms, traditional fitness centres with pools and classes. He bookmarked several options, planning to visit them over the weekend.
The evening stretched ahead of him. Jay sat deeper into his chair, accepting the unusual restlessness as part of his continuing evolution. Six months ago, he would have treasured this solitude without question. Now, he wondered what else might be possible, what other activities he might enjoy if he remained open to them.
Scene 5
Preparations
The week before the gala, Jay made his rounds to collect the various elements of his formal ensemble. The tailor greeted him politely, clearly pleased with the final result.
"Perfect fit," the man said as Jay examined himself in the fitting room mirror. "You have good proportions for formal wear."
Jay turned slowly, assessing the reflection. The tuxedo looked good on him. The black wool draped smoothly across his shoulders, the trousers fell in clean lines, and the overall effect was both elegant and understated. He looked like he just might belong at the Grand Hotel.
"The shoes as well," the tailor continued, presenting a pair of patent leather oxfords. "Premium leather, hand-stitched. They'll be comfortable for an entire evening."
Jay tried them on, walking across the fitting room floor. The shoes felt substantial but not heavy, with the quality that would last for years.It wasn't cheap, but looking at the complete ensemble, he felt the investment was justified.
"I'm satisfied," Jay said, changing back into his regular clothes. "Thank you for the excellent work."
"You'll want to practice that a few times before the event," the shop assistant advised, demonstrating the bow tie technique. "Most people underestimate how tricky it can be under pressure."
Walking back to his apartment, Jay realized he needed to address another detail: his hair. While he kept it short and neat, the gala demanded a more refined appearance. He didn't want to embarrass himself or, by extension, his colleagues with a casual look at such a prestigious event.
Finding a hairdresser was more challenging than expected. Jay called several salons near his apartment, only to discover they were completely booked. The third salon he contacted explained that January was peak season for formal events, with many people scheduling appointments after the holidays.
"I'm sorry, but we're fully booked through next Friday," the receptionist said. "You might try calling some of the higher-end establishments. They sometimes have last-minute availability."
Jay's anxiety grew as he worked through his list. He'd assumed a simple haircut would be easy to arrange, but his procrastination had created an unnecessary obstacle. Finally, a salon in the upscale shopping district had an opening. Jay winced at the price but accepted. The amount would have been unthinkable a month ago, but his bonus had changed his perspective on necessary expenses. Looking presentable at the gala was worth the money.
Thursday afternoon, Jay collected his new suits from the boutique. The tailor had outdone himself—each piece fit impeccably, turning Jay's appearance from merely acceptable to elegant. The gray suit matched out his eyes, the navy complemented his pale complexion, and the pinstripe added sophistication to his overall look.
"These will serve you well. Quality pieces that will last for years with proper care," the tailor said.
Jay thanked him and headed to the nearby department store to complete his wardrobe upgrade. He selected several shirts in fine cotton, with better cuts and details than his previous purchases. The prices matched the quality—each shirt cost more than he'd previously spent on an entire outfit—but the improvement was undeniable.
Returning home, Jay faced an unexpected problem. His small studio apartment had exactly one closet, and it was now overwhelmed by his expanded wardrobe. The new suits, shirts, and tuxedo required more space than he had available.
The old clothes would have to go. Jay sorted through his existing wardrobe, identifying pieces that were worn beyond repair or simply outclassed by his new acquisitions. Several shirts with frayed cuffs joined the donation pile, along with sweaters that had seen better days and casual wear that no longer fit his image.
The hardest decision involved his first suit—a basic gray piece he'd bought for job interviews years ago. The fabric was inferior to his new purchases, the cut unflattering in retrospect, but it held sentimental value. Jay held it up, remembering his nervousness during those early interviews, the hope and uncertainty that had accompanied each job application.
After a moment's hesitation, he folded it and placed it on the donation pile. His small space couldn't accommodate keeping clothes for purely sentimental reasons.
The reorganized closet looked dramatically different. Where once hung a collection of serviceable but uninspiring garments, now stood a selection of elegant pieces. It looked almost comical in his modest studio apartment—these expensive clothes seemed to belong in a larger space, with better lighting and more sophisticated furniture.
Jay purchased a set of cedar sachets to keep his clothes fresh, placing them strategically throughout the closet. The small apartment sometimes retained cooking odours or general staleness, and he refused to let his investment in quality clothing be compromised by poor storage conditions.
As he organized his new wardrobe, Jay thought about other aspects of his appearance. He had never worn cologne, partly from lack of interest but mostly because of cost. Now, with his improved financial situation, the option seemed worth considering.
He researched fragrances online, quickly becoming discouraged by the complexity of the topic. Base notes, top notes, seasonal appropriateness, projection, longevity—the vocabulary alone was intimidating. Jay imagined himself smelling like a department store fragrance counter. Better to smell neutral than to risk  olfactory offence, especially at his first major company event. The last thing Jay wanted was to arrive at the gala smelling like an overzealous teenager.
Jay stepped back and surveyed his apartment with fresh eyes. The studio was small—a single bed, a compact living area, a kitchenette with a small dining table that served his needs. The space was efficiently organized, everything in its proper place.
He had always found the apartment cosy. The size matched his lifestyle and budget. Now, with his closet full of expensive clothes and his bank account containing an unprecedented amount of money, he could afford something larger. The thought had crossed his mind several times over the past weeks.
But Jay dismissed the idea each time it arose. His current apartment felt secure and manageable. Moving would require faith in his continued employment and success—faith he wasn't quite ready to embrace. The studio represented stability and caution, qualities that had served him well throughout his life.
Besides, he enjoyed the space. The large windows provided good natural light and the neighbourhood was beautiful and safe. Jay sat on the sofa with a cup of tea, pleased with his preparations for the gala. The tuxedo was perfect and the hairdresser appointment was scheduled. He felt ready to represent Turner & Associates with dignity.
Chapter 10: The high finance
Scene 1
The Grand Gala
The night of the gala arrived with unseasonable warmth for January. Jay spent an hour preparing, adjusting his bow tie multiple times and checking his appearance from every angle. The salon had worked wonders with his hair, creating a polished style that enhanced his features without looking overdone.
Still, staring at his reflection, Jay felt ridiculous. The formal wear was perfect, his grooming impeccable, but he still couldn't shake the sensation of playing dress-up.
The taxi ride to the Grand Hotel gave him time to compose himself. Through the window, he watched the city—people heading to dinner, couples walking hand in hand. It felt comforting after the surreal experience of getting ready for such an elegant event.
The Grand Hotel's entrance was ablaze with lights, red carpet extending from the street to the lobby doors. Photographers flanked the walkway, capturing arrivals for society pages and business publications. Jay paid the driver and stepped onto the pavement, immediately feeling intimidated by the spectacle.
Inside, the ballroom was breathtaking. Crystal chandeliers cast warm light over hundreds of guests in formal attire. Women wore stunning gowns in rich colors. Men in perfectly tailored tuxedos stood in groups, discussing business.
Jay searched frantically for familiar faces. The sheer scale of the event was staggering—at least three times larger than the quarterly gathering he'd attended months earlier. This wasn't just a company party, it was a showcase of the industry's elite.
"Jay!" Luc's voice cut through the ambient noise. "Over here!"
Jay spotted his colleague near the bar, looking comfortable and relaxed in his formal wear. He made his way through the crowd, relieved to find an anchor point.
"You look fantastic," Luc said, adjusting his own bow tie. "The tuxedo suits you perfectly."
"Thank you," Jay said, tugging at his cuffs. "I feel like a penguin." 
"A very handsome penguin," Luc said with a grin.
"I feel completely out of place."
"Everyone does at these things. The trick is pretending otherwise until you believe it."
Jay tried to follow this advice, but the grandeur of the event made it difficult. Waiters circulated with champagne, while the conversations around him involved mergers, acquisitions, and nine-figure deals discussed as casually as weather reports.
Across the room, Ian stood with a group of distinguished-looking men, his posture perfect and expression attentive. Even from a distance, he commanded attention, radiating confidence that came from years of success in this world.
Their eyes met briefly, and Jay felt a flutter in his stomach. Ian was momentarily speechless. The young man looked stunning, the tuxedo's lines emphasizing his slender frame. There was something endearing about Jay’s bearing, slightly uncertain but determined to rise to the occasion. The tailor had done exceptional work, and whoever had styled Jay's hair deserved recognition. Even Jay's obvious nervousness only added to his appeal, creating an almost irresistible combination of sophistication and vulnerability.
"Earth to Ian," Leo's voice cut through his thoughts. "You're staring."
Ian turned to find his friend watching him with undisguised amusement. 
"I wasn't staring," Ian said coolly. "I was observing the guests."
"Right. One guest in particular." Leo followed Ian's previous direction and spotted Jay. "Oh, he does look good. Almost too good for this crowd of sharks. Half the people here are already noticing him. He's attractive and clearly out of his element. Someone's going to make a move."
Ian felt something twist in his stomach. "That's not my concern."
"Isn't it?" Leo's smile widened. "You should probably go protect your poor assistant before someone sweeps him off his feet."
"Don't be ridiculous."
"I'm being practical. He's your responsibility tonight, isn't he? Part of your team?"
Ian glanced back toward Jay. The young man was handling himself well, but Ian could see the tension in his shoulders.
"He can take care of himself."
"Of course he can. But wouldn't it be terrible if some smooth-talking investment banker decided to show him around? You know how persuasive those types can be."
Ian's jaw tightened. "You're being absurd."
"Am I? Because I see at least three potential suitors eyeing him right now." Leo gestured discretely toward different groups. "The tall one by the bar has been watching him since he arrived. The silver-haired gentleman near the windows keeps glancing over. And don't get me started on that young partner from Greymount—he's practically circling like a predator."
Ian followed Leo's indications and felt his irritation spike. His friend wasn't wrong—Jay had attracted attention, and not all of it felt benign.
"Stop talking."
Leo's delighted laugh made several nearby guests turn their heads. "You're jealous. This is wonderful."
"I'm not jealous. I'm concerned about appropriate behaviour."
"Sure you are. Which is why you should go rescue the poor puppy before someone else does."
Ian shot Leo a withering look. "Don't call him that."
"Why not? He does have that adorable lost look. Very appealing to the protective instincts."
"You're insufferable."
"I'm helpful. Go claim your territory before it's too late."
Ian opened his mouth to deliver a cutting response, then stopped. Across the room, Jay was indeed being approached by the silver-haired man Leo had mentioned—a partner from a competing firm known for his aggressive recruitment tactics.
"Fine," Ian said abruptly. "I'll go ensure he's comfortable."
"Of course you will," Leo said, his expression triumphant. "How noble of you."
Ian straightened his shoulders and moved across the room, telling himself he was simply being a responsible supervisor. The fact that his pulse had quickened at the sight of Jay in formal wear was entirely irrelevant.
"Excuse me," Ian said, appearing beside Jay with grace. "I hope you're both enjoying the evening."
"Ian," Jay said, relief evident in his voice. "Yes, it's magnificent."
"Magnificent indeed," the man agreed.
"If you'll excuse us, I need to introduce my colleagues to some of our other clients."
Without waiting for a response, Ian guided Jay and Luc toward the buffet area where Max and Amy were already stationed, plates filled with elegant appetizers.
"Thank goodness," Jay murmured as they walked. "I had no idea what to say to him."
"You were doing fine," Ian said, though privately he appreciated the excuse to intervene. "Some guests can be... intense."
"That's one word for it," Luc added.
They reached the buffet where Max greeted them cheerfully. "There you are! I was beginning to think you'd abandoned us for more glamorous company."
"Never," Ian said, surprising himself with how much he meant it. "How are you finding the evening?"
"Excellent food, decent wine, and enough networking opportunities to last a lifetime," Amy replied. "Though I have to say, Jay, you look great."
Jay flushed at the compliment. "Thank you. I feel like I'm playing dress-up."
"We all are," Max said. "That's half the fun."
Ian remained with the group instead of mingling with the industry leaders as he typically would. Usually, these events were strategic opportunities for building relationships and identifying new business prospects. Tonight, however, he felt more interested in ensuring his team's comfort than advancing his own agenda.
"This is unprecedented," Leo said, appearing with a fresh drink and an expression of delighted surprise. "Ian Hagen, master networker, holding court with his own staff instead of wooing potential clients."
"The evening is young," Ian replied, though he made no move to leave the group.
"Indeed it is," Leo agreed, his smile widening. "Indeed it is."
Jay stood slightly behind Ian, unconsciously using him as a shield against the rest of the room. Ian's broad shoulders and confident bearing created a pocket of calm in the chaos, making the evening feel more manageable.
Scene 2
The incident
Ian was inevitably drawn into conversations with key clients and the strategic networking that made these events worthwhile. Jay watched him move through the crowd, commanding attention without seeming to seek it.
"Come on," Max said, appearing at Jay's elbow. "Let me introduce you to some people."
Before Jay could protest, he got swept into a group of distinguished guests. Max made introductions with enthusiasm, presenting Jay as "one of our most promising analysts" to a rotating cast of clients and business partners.
"Jay, meet Meg Randon from Pacific Investments," Max said, guiding him toward an elegant woman in a burgundy gown. "Meg, Jay has been instrumental in our recent acquisition."
The conversations moved from one introduction to the next. Jay tried to keep up, giving rehearsed responses about company performance. The guests seemed interested in his insights, which was both flattering and terrifying.
"Here, you need a drink," said a man, pressing a champagne flute into Jay's hand. "Can't discuss business without proper lubrication."
Jay accepted the glass, taking small sips as the conversations continued. Another guest immediately brought another one when he finished, then another handed him a different cocktail. The alcohol helped ease his nerves, making the intimidating crowd seem more manageable.
"You're much younger than I expected," commented a woman with pearls and a charming smile. "Ian certainly knows how to pick them."
Jay wasn't sure how to respond to that, so he simply smiled and took another sip of his drink. The room felt warmer now, the conversations louder and more animated, everything slightly out of focus.
"Such a refreshing change," another client whose name Jay had already forgotten, commented, watching Jay with uncomfortable intensity. "Most young people in this business are so aggressive, so hungry. You have a gentler disposition."
Jay managed a polite smile, though the man's tone made him uneasy.
"Absolutely charming," the same client continued, moving closer. "You know, you remind me of someone I used to know. Same delicate features, same innocent expression."
The man's hand landed on Jay's shoulder. Jay stepped back, but the circle of people around him made retreat impossible.
"Such pretty eyes," the client continued, his voice dropping to an intimate murmur. "I bet you get a lot of attention with looks like that."
Jay's chest tightened. The man's hand moved to his back, fingers trailing along his spine, making his skin crawl. Other members of the group continued talking, apparently oblivious to the inappropriate contact.
"You're very young, aren't you?" the client asked, his breath warm against Jay's ear. "Fresh out of university, I'd guess. Still learning the ropes."
Jay tried to respond, but his voice caught. The man's hand had moved to his waist, thumb stroking the fabric of his jacket. The touch felt predatory, reducing Jay to nothing more than an object for this powerful man's entertainment.
"I should—" Jay began, but the client interrupted.
"No need to be shy, beautiful. In this business, connections matter. A young man like you could benefit from the right kind of guidance."
The implications hung heavy in the air. Jay felt his composure cracking under the weight of humiliation and powerlessness. He was trapped again, prey for someone who saw his youth and perceived weakness as invitation. The alcohol that had earlier provided confidence now made him feel dizzy. 
"I should probably find my colleagues."
"Oh, don't rush off. We're just getting acquainted. You know, I have several opportunities coming up that might suit someone with your... particular talents. Perhaps we could discuss them privately sometime."
"I appreciate the offer, but I'm very happy in my current position."
"Are you? How refreshing. Such loyalty is rare in someone so young and attractive." The man's other hand touched Jay's arm, fingers trailing along the fabric. "Though I wonder if Ian fully appreciates what he has. Such a waste if he doesn't."
Jay could feel tears welling up. The man's hands, his suggestive tone, the way he looked at Jay like he was something to be consumed—it all felt horribly familiar.
"Excuse me," Jay whispered, pulling away abruptly. "I need to use the restroom."
He fled, weaving through the crowd toward the hotel's facilities. His hands shook as he pushed through the bathroom door, relieved to find it empty.
Jay stared at his reflection in the mirror, trying to compose himself. He was flushed, his breathing unsteady. He splashed cold water on his face, hoping to calm his racing pulse.
Shame washed over him—the same helpless feeling he'd experienced at his first job. All his progress, all his growing confidence, seemed to evaporate in the face of this casual violation.
Jay locked himself in a stall, pressing his back against the door while trying to control his breathing. "You're being ridiculous," he told himself. "Nothing actually happened." But the attempts at rationalization did nothing. It still felt like a violation, even if nothing explicitly inappropriate had occurred.
Jay stayed in the stall for several minutes, composing himself enough to face the world again. When he finally emerged, he nearly collided with Ian in the hallway.
"There you are. I've been looking for you."
Jay opened his mouth to speak, but Ian's expression stopped him. He looked furious, his jaw clenched and eyes blazing with barely controlled anger.
"I'm sorry," Jay said quickly, shrinking back. "I didn't mean to disappear. I just needed a moment."
Ian's expression immediately softened. "You have nothing to apologize for. Are you alright?"
"Yes, I'm fine. Just needed some air."
Ian looked at Jay's face—the red-rimmed eyes, the trembling hands. "No, you're not fine. What happened?"
"Nothing happened. Really, I'm just tired."
"Jay. You don't have to tell me anything, but please don't pretend you're fine when you're obviously not."
"I'm sorry. I'm probably overreacting. It's just that these events can be overwhelming."
"They can be uncomfortable, yes. But they're not supposed to be traumatizing." Ian's tone held an edge of steel. "Did someone upset you?"
"It was probably nothing. Just a misunderstanding."
Ian's expression darkened again, but he kept his voice level. "Would you like to leave? I can have my driver take you home."
"That's not necessary. I can get a taxi."
"I insist. And I'll come with you, if you don't mind. Someone here has thoroughly irritated me tonight, and I need a reason to leave before I do something unprofessional."
Jay looked surprised. "You want to leave too?"
"Desperately. I was one inappropriate comment away from punching someone in the face in front of half the financial district." Ian's slight smile took the edge off his words. "You'd actually be doing me a favor."
The admission made Jay feel less pathetic. "I find that hard to believe."
"You'd be surprised. I have a very short fuse when it comes to certain types of behaviour. Come on, let's go"
 "If you're sure it's not too much trouble."
"None at all. Let me call my driver."
Without drawing attention, Ian guided Jay through a staff door at the rear of the hotel, where a black car stood ready for them. Their discreet departure blended in with the flow of hotel staff coming and going.
Scene 3
Soothing the fears
The car's interior was luxurious but not ostentatious. Jay sank into the cushions, finally allowing himself to relax.
"You know," Ian said as they pulled into traffic, "I once attended a similar event where a client spent the entire evening trying to convince me to invest in his nephew's cryptocurrency venture. Apparently, it was going to revolutionize the pet grooming industry."
Jay looked at him in surprise. "Really?"
"Completely serious. He cornered me by the seafood station for forty minutes, explaining how blockchain technology would transform dog bathing. I finally escaped by claiming I was allergic to shellfish and needed immediate medical attention."
Despite everything, Jay smiled. "Did it work?"
"Beautifully. Though I had to avoid the seafood station for the rest of the evening, which was unfortunate because they had excellent crab cakes."
Ian continued with similar stories—absurd client requests, social faux pas at formal events, the occasional spectacular failure of decorum. His dry humour and timing gradually dissolved the tension in Jay's shoulders.
"Here we are," Ian said as the car stopped in front of Jay's building.
Jay looked at the modest apartment complex, suddenly acutely aware of how different it was from Ian's world. "Thank you for the ride. And for... everything."
"It was my pleasure. I hope you feel better tomorrow."
Jay hesitated at the car door. "Would you like to come up for tea? I know it's late, but..."
Ian paused, clearly weighing the invitation. "If you're sure it wouldn't be too much trouble."
"No trouble at all."
Jay led the way through the building's lobby to the stairwell, acutely conscious of the contrast between this and the elegant hotel they'd just left. "I'm sorry there's no elevator. It's four flights up."
"I don't mind stairs," Ian said, following without complaint.
Jay watched him climb with ease despite his formal attire. He was clearly in excellent physical condition, making the four flights seem effortless.
"This is it," Jay said, unlocking his apartment door. "It's not much, but it's home."
Ian entered the small but tidy space, taking in the simple furniture and careful organization. "It's very comfortable. You've made it welcoming."
Jay busied himself in the kitchen, glad to have something to do with his hands. "I hope you don't mind basic tea. I'm not much of a host."
"Basic tea sounds perfect."
Ian sat on the small couch, somehow making the apartment feel more sophisticated instead of highlighting its limitations. When Jay brought the tea, Ian accepted it with the same grace he'd shown at the elegant gala.
"How long have you lived here?" Ian asked, making conversation.
"About six years. I found it right after I moved to the city." Jay curled up in the armchair across from him. "It's not glamorous, but the rent is reasonable and the neighbourhood is safe."
"Comfort matters more than luxury in most cases. Was having a place to yourself important to you?"
"Yes. I know it's more expensive than having roommates, but I value the privacy. My previous financial situation didn't really allow for anything better than this studio."
"Privacy is worth the premium. Especially after long days at work."
"Exactly. I could probably afford something closer to the office now, maybe even a proper one-bedroom, but I'm used to this area. There are nice parks nearby, good cafes. It feels like home."
"That's more valuable than square footage. A lengthy commute can be draining, but if you're comfortable here..."
"I actually enjoy the metro ride. Gives me time to think, or read. Though I suppose you don't use public transport much."
"More than you might think. Sometimes it's faster than dealing with traffic. Speaking of adjustments, how did you find tonight's event? I know these corporate functions can be intimidating."
"It was... intense. My previous jobs never had anything like that, so I'm still learning how to handle them. The networking aspect especially."
"You handled yourself very well. Better than most people at their first major gala."
"Really?" Jay looked surprised. "I felt completely out of my depth. All those important people, discussing deals worth millions..."
"That's perfectly normal. The key is listening more than speaking, which you did naturally. Most people try too hard to impress and end up saying something they regret."
"I was terrified of saying the wrong thing to the wrong person."
"A healthy fear. But you were polite and interested in what others had to say. That's rarer than you might think in our industry."
Jay felt a warmth spread through his chest at the praise. "Thank you. That means a lot coming from you."
"How did you find the scale of it? I imagine it was quite different from smaller company events."
"Completely different. The quarterly meeting felt manageable, but tonight..." Jay shook his head. "The ballroom was enormous, and everyone seemed to know exactly who they should be talking to and why."
"That comes with experience. And frankly, half of those people are just as uncertain as you were—they're simply better at hiding it."
Jay laughed softly. "That's oddly comforting."
"The real secret is that most networking is just extended small talk with business cards. You're naturally good at putting people at ease, which is more valuable than knowing every industry insider."
"I hadn't thought of it that way."
Ian drank his tea, letting the quiet stretch out before setting the cup down and looking at Jay. "Are you feeling better about the evening? I know it ended on a difficult note."
Jay's expression sobered slightly. "Much better, thank you. I was worried I'd embarrassed myself, or worse, reflected poorly on the company."
"Not at all. You represented Turner & Associates admirably. And if anyone made you uncomfortable, that's entirely their failing, not yours."
"I appreciate you saying that."
"Of course." Ian said, then added noticing Jay's fatigue. "I should probably head home. Thank you for the tea, and for giving me an excuse to leave early."
"Thank you for making sure I got home safely. And for the stories. They helped more than you know."
"Jay, if anyone makes you uncomfortable at future events, please don't hesitate to find me immediately. These functions can be challenging, but you shouldn't have to endure harassment."
Jay nodded, touched by the concern. "I will. Thank you."
After Ian left, Jay sat in his apartment, processing the evening's events. The incident still bothered him, but Ian's kindness had turned what could have been a traumatic memory into something more manageable. He'd seen a different side of Ian tonight—warmer, even playful in his storytelling. Jay felt like he might have found not just a mentor, but someone who cared about his well-being.
Meanwhile, Ian sat in his car outside Jay's building, wrestling with his own thoughts. He'd overstepped tonight, but seeing Jay distressed had overridden every other consideration. The fury he'd felt still simmered beneath his composed exterior.
He'd handled it appropriately, he told himself. He'd helped a colleague through a difficult situation. Nothing more. The fact that Jay looked beautiful in his formal wear, that his vulnerability had stirred protectiveness in Ian's chest, that sitting in his modest apartment had felt more comfortable than any elegant venue—none of that mattered. Ian finally instructed his driver to take him home, but the image of Jay's smile lingered long after the evening ended.
Scene 4
Aftermath
Jay arrived at the office early Monday morning, as had become his habit. It felt comforting after the weekend's emotional upheaval. He'd spent Sunday processing the gala's events, alternating between embarrassment about his reaction and gratitude for Ian's kindness.
Ian walked in at five minutes to eight.
"Good morning, Ian. Your nine o'clock meeting has been moved to nine-thirty, and the reports are ready for your review."
"Thank you, Jay. I trust you had a pleasant weekend?"
"Yes, very restful. I hope yours was as well."
"It was. Thank you for asking."
The exchange was perfectly normal and unremarkable. Jay felt both relief and an odd sense of disappointment. He'd wondered if Saturday's events might change their dynamic somehow, but Ian's composed demeanour made it clear that nothing was different. He had simply been kind to a distressed colleague—nothing more, nothing less.
Jay was thankful for Ian's discretion. The last thing he wanted was awkwardness or pity affecting their working relationship. Still, part of him had hoped for some acknowledgement of the connection he'd felt during their conversation in his apartment.
As the morning progressed, the office filled with people. But instead of diving into work, everyone seemed focused on dissecting the gala's events. Jay heard fragments of conversations from every direction—praise for the venue, critiques of the food, speculation about various business deals discussed.
"Did you see Pat's dress?" Ela was saying to Amy as Jay passed their desks. "That shade of emerald was absolutely stunning on her."
"The food was incredible," Max added, joining their conversation. "Though I think I ate enough appetizers to feed a small country."
"The real mystery is why Ian left so early. He always stays until the bitter end at these things," Ela said, perching on the edge of Zoe's desk.
"Maybe he had another engagement," Zoe replied. The comment held no real conviction. Everyone knew how unlikely that was, but she wasn’t one to speculate.
"Or maybe he was just tired of schmoozing. Even Ian has his limits," Max added.
Jay concentrated on his screen, hoping his face wouldn't betray anything. Clearly, Ian had been discreet about their departure—no one seemed to have noticed Jay's early exit or connected it to Ian's.
Kim appeared at Jay's desk with a grin. "So, how did you survive your first major gala? You looked terrified when I saw you earlier in the evening."
"I drank too much," Jay said, sticking to the simple explanation he'd prepared. "Spent half the evening in the bathroom."
The admission prompted a round of laughter from nearby colleagues.
"Welcome to the club. We've all been there. Remember Max's last gala?" Luc said.
"Hey now. That champagne was stronger than advertised," Max protested, but he was smiling.
"You had to be practically carried out. Leo found you asleep in the coat check," Amy reminded him.
"At least I didn't spill red wine on the mayor's wife. That was Kim's contribution to last year's festivities," Ela added.
"It was an accident! Though I still think she deserved it after that comment about tech workers," Kim responded.
Jay listened to the stories with growing relief. His own embarrassment seemed minor compared to the spectacular mishaps being shared. Everyone had mortifying moments at these events—it was apparently part of the experience.
"At least these galas only happen once a year," Luc said, appearing at Jay's desk with a fresh cup of coffee. "Though I have to admit, the networking opportunities are valuable."
 "True," Jay agreed. "I met several interesting people before... well, before I overindulged."  
"The trick is pacing yourself. Start with wine, switch to water between drinks, avoid the stronger cocktails entirely. Though I suppose learning these lessons the hard way is part of the experience."  
Jay nodded, accepting the advice while privately knowing alcohol hadn't been the real problem. The memory of the incident still made his stomach twist, but the normalcy of the office setting helped push those thoughts into the background.
"The important thing is that we all survived to tell the tale. And the gossip from these things keeps us entertained for months," Ela said sagely.
"Speaking of gossip," Kim said, lowering his voice conspiratorially, "did anyone else notice that Cruver spent the entire evening trying to corner people by the bar? He was like a predator stalking prey."
Jay’s hands stilled on his keyboard. Cruver. He hadn’t been able to recall the name before, but now that it was mentioned, he was almost certain that was the man.
"Cruver's always been handsy. Someone should report him eventually," Amy said with distaste.
"To whom? His own firm? They'd just cover it up," Luc asked.
"Maybe, but his behavior is getting worse. Someone's going to call him out publicly sooner or later."
The conversation drifted to other topics, but Jay thought about Cruver's aggressive behaviour. Had other people noticed? Had he been equally inappropriate with others?
Throughout the morning, Ian acted as if nothing had happened. The only difference Jay noticed was an occasional glance in his direction—subtle looks that lasted perhaps a second longer than normal.
Jay told himself he was imagining things. Ian was simply ensuring his assistant was managing his workload properly. Nothing more complicated than that.
By lunch, the gala's aftermath had already turned into office legend. Stories would be retold and embellished over the coming weeks, but the immediate excitement was fading. Jay was glad that his own experience had been absorbed into the general chaos without attracting attention.
By the end of the day, Jay thought about how normal everything felt. The weekend's emotional turmoil might have been a dream, except for the lingering warmth he felt when remembering Ian's kindness. Ian had seen him at his most vulnerable and responded with compassion.
Jay was content to let the incident fade into memory, another workplace challenge resolved. He had no way of knowing that Ian's thoughts were far from calm.
In his office, Ian made several discrete phone calls throughout the day. By evening, he'd confirmed Cruver's identity and begun researching his business relationships. Turner & Associates did business with his company, but that didn't make him untouchable.
He would do everything in his power to ensure Cruver paid for his behaviour. He had made a mistake targeting Jay, and Ian intended to make sure he regretted it.
The plan would take time to implement properly. Ian couldn't act impulsively without risking his own standing. But Cruver would learn that some actions had severe consequences, even if they initially seemed trivial.
As Jay prepared to leave for the day, Ian watched him organize his desk in the same way he always did. He seemed to have recovered from Saturday's distress, but Ian couldn't forget the terror in his eyes. The image had lodged deeply, surfacing whenever he tried to focus on work.
He knew he was overreacting. The situation was under control, Jay was safe now. His own response troubled him—the anger, the protectiveness. It wasn’t simple concern anymore. The thought of anyone taking advantage of Jay left his pulse spiking.
Jay deserved to work in an environment free from predatory behaviour. Ian would make sure that happened.
Scene 5
Choice
January turned into February with the relentless pace of new year business. The office was overwhelmed with the endless stream of reports that marked the beginning of another fiscal cycle. Jay was busy managing Ian's increasingly complex schedule while handling the administrative tasks that kept the department running smoothly.
HR flooded everyone's inboxes with reminders about upcoming deadlines. Performance reviews needed to be scheduled, annual leave requests submitted, and various compliance training modules completed. The gala felt like a distant memory, which suited Jay perfectly. He'd successfully avoided thinking about Cruver's inappropriate behavior, though Ian's protective response that evening remained a warm memory he revisited more often than he cared to admit.
"Jay," Ian said on one morning at the beginning of February, "could you schedule a performance review for us? It's been six months since you started."
Jay looked up from his computer, surprised by how quickly the time had passed. "Of course. When would be convenient?"
"Tomorrow afternoon, if possible. Two o'clock."
Jay added the appointment to Ian's calendar, feeling nervous. Performance reviews at his previous job had been perfunctory affairs, brief meetings where his supervisor gave generic feedback before moving on. He suspected Ian's approach would be more comprehensive.
The next afternoon, Jay knocked on Ian's office door at two o'clock, holding a notepad and wearing his most attentive expression.
"Please, sit," Ian said, gesturing to the chair across from his desk. "I want to discuss your progress over the past six months."
Jay sat on the chair, trying to read Ian's mood. He looked serious.
"First, I want to acknowledge that you've exceeded expectations in every area. Your organizational skills and ability to anticipate needs have been exemplary. You've made my job much easier."
Jay felt warmth spread through his chest. "Thank you. I've tried to be scrupulous."
"You've been more than that. You've been intuitive. That's a rare quality in this industry. Your client interaction skills have also improved dramatically."
"I appreciate the feedback."
"Which brings me to my main point. I believe you're ready for advancement. I'd like to offer you a position as a regular team member. It would mean a salary increase and expanded responsibilities."
Jay was stunned. "A promotion?"
"Yes. You'd be working directly on analysis projects and strategic planning. It's a natural progression for someone with your capabilities."
Jay's mind raced. A promotion meant recognition, advancement, everything he'd dreamed of when he first started. But it also meant leaving his current role, no longer working directly for Ian.
"I... I don't know what to say."
"You don't need to decide immediately. But I wanted you to know that the opportunity exists. Luc followed the same path. He started as my assistant and moved up to regular team member within six months."
"But Luc had much better credentials than I do."
"Credentials matter less than performance. And your performance has been exceptional. You seem hesitant. May I ask why?"
Jay struggled to find words that wouldn't reveal too much. "I'm not sure I'm ready for that level of responsibility. I enjoy my current work, and I'm still learning so much in this role."
His real reasons were more complicated. Jay wanted to continue working directly for Ian, wanted to remain the person Ian relied on for daily support. The thought of being reassigned to work with other team members, of losing the close collaboration they'd developed, filled him with unexpected dread.
Ian watched Jay's internal struggle. Privately, he was overjoyed by Jay's hesitation. Working with Jay had become one of the most enjoyable aspects of his life. The younger man's dedication made every day more pleasant.
But Ian's integrity overrode his personal preferences. "I understand your caution, but I'd encourage you to consider the opportunity. Career advancement is important, especially at your age."
Jay's discomfort was evident in his posture. "Could I think about it?"
"Of course. Take all the time you need. And Jay? This is just a proposal. If you decide you prefer your current role, I'll be more than happy to retain your services. You're invaluable in this position."
Jay felt relief wash over him. "Thank you. I really do appreciate the offer."
"Consider it carefully. But know that either choice will be respected."
When Jay returned to his desk, he found it difficult to concentrate. The promotion was objectively the right choice—better pay, clearer advancement opportunities. But something in his chest rebelled against the idea of leaving Ian's direct service.
"Hey," Luc said, appearing at his desk. "How did the review go?"
"Good. He offered me a promotion to regular team member."
Luc's eyebrows shot up. "That's fantastic! Congratulations."
"I haven't accepted yet."
"What? Why not?"
Jay fumbled for an explanation. "I'm not sure I'm ready. I like my current work."
"Jay, that's career advancement. You can't stay an assistant forever."
"I know, I just... I want to think about it."
By the end of the week, word had spread through the office. Max congratulated him over lunch, Amy shared advice about transitioning to analytical work.
"So when do you start in your new role?" Zoe asked during a coffee break.
"I haven't decided yet," Jay admitted.
The team exchanged glances. It was clear they found his hesitation puzzling, but no one pressed for details.
That evening, Jay sat in his apartment, weighing his options. The logical choice was obvious—accept the promotion, advance his career, prove himself capable of growth. But his heart pulled him in a different direction.
He thought about Ian, about the joy of being the person Ian turned to when everything else went wrong. The role gave him a sense of purpose beyond what career advancement could offer.
More than that, he'd observed Ian's isolation within the office. He shouldered tremendous responsibility, made difficult decisions, and bore the weight of the department's success with minimal support. Jay wanted to be that support, to continue making Ian's life easier. He didn't want to advance away from Ian, he wanted to advance alongside him. And if that meant remaining an assistant, so be it.
Monday morning, Jay knocked on Ian's office door. "I've made my decision about the promotion."
Ian looked up from his computer. "And?"
"I'd like to stay in my current role, if that's acceptable."
"May I ask why?"
Jay had prepared for this question. "I enjoy the work. I feel like I'm still learning, and I want to master this role completely before moving on to something else."
It wasn't the complete truth, but it wasn't a lie either. Ian watched him in silence for a long moment.
"I respect that decision. But I want you to know that the opportunity will remain open. If you change your mind in the future, we can revisit the conversation."
"Thank you. I appreciate that."
As Jay returned to his desk, he felt a sense of rightness about his choice. It might not be the most ambitious path, but it felt authentic to who he was and what he wanted.
Ian watched Jay leave, fighting to suppress his relief. Having Jay continue as his assistant was a selfish preference, but one that made his workdays immeasurably better.
For Jay, the decision marked another milestone in his journey at Turner & Associates. His skills had been acknowledged, he'd been offered advancement, and he'd made a choice based on his own values. It felt like growth, even if it meant staying in the same role.
Surface Tension
Chapter 11: February rush
Scene 1
Snow and scent
February began with a big drop in temperature and a massive snowfall that blanketed the city. Jay watched from his apartment window as the flakes continued to fall, thick and relentless, coating everything in pristine white. The beauty was undeniable, but he knew the commute would be brutal.
His prediction was correct. The metro crawled through the tunnels at half speed, announcements crackling over the intercom about weather-related delays. Jay fidgeted impatiently in his seat, checking his phone repeatedly. He normally arrived at the office by seven-thirty, giving himself a comfortable buffer before the workday began. Today he wouldn't make it until ten minutes before eight.
Still early by most standards, but later than he'd like. The deviation made him uncomfortable.
The Northlight Financial Center emerged from the snow like a gleaming beacon glowing against the gray morning sky. Jay hurried through the lobby, his old coat doing little to shield him from the cold. He was still shaking as he brushed the snow from his shoulders and approached the elevator bank. The doors to the middle elevator slid open just as he pressed the button, revealing Ian inside.
"Good morning," Ian said, glancing up from his phone.
Jay stepped inside and and waited for the doors to close, feeling self-conscious. "Good morning. The weather caused some delays on the metro."
"I imagine it did. The roads weren't much better."
The elevator began its ascent, and Jay was acutely aware of the confined space, smaller than he'd ever noticed before. Ian stood near the back corner, perfectly composed.
A subtle scent reached Jay, fresh and slightly spicy, rich without being overpowering. He'd never noticed Ian's cologne before, or perhaps he'd simply never paid attention. Now that he had, it seemed to fill the small space, making him hyperaware of Ian standing just a few centimeters away.
Jay looked at the floor numbers on the digital display, trying to ignore the way his pulse had quickened for no logical reason. This wasn't the first time they'd shared an elevator, though usually it was at the end of long days when they rode down together after finishing late work. But his  morning, the moment felt different.
When the doors opened at their floor, Jay waited for Ian to exit first, then followed him through the office doors.
"Have a good morning, Jay."
"You too."
Jay walked to his desk, hanging his coat in the closet. He powered up his computer and reviewed Ian's schedule. The morning felt off-kilter, though he couldn't pinpoint why.
When he went to make his coffee, he was so distracted he nearly selected the wrong program, only realizing at the last moment he was about to brew an espresso instead of morning latte. Had he always been so aware of Ian? The scent, the sound of his voice in the small elevator space?
The questions felt foolish, and Jay pushed them aside as the day's workload demanded his attention. February had brought an avalanche of new client proposals that needed immediate review. He threw himself into the tasks, letting them take over his thoughts.
The hours passed quickly, consumed by phone calls, document preparation, and the endless stream of emails. Since the weather was anything but inviting and the workload had reached its winter peak, the team abandoned their lunchtime outings. Instead, they ordered takeout and ate in the office kitchen. Jay didn’t join them, eating at his desk while composing messages between bites. He barely looked up from his screen all day.
By seven o'clock, most of the office had cleared out, but Ian remained at his desk, working through a complex analysis. Jay organized his own materials but made no move to leave.
"Jay," Ian said, appearing at his desk. "You don't need to stay late. I can handle the rest of this."
"I don't mind. There's still work to finish."
"I appreciate the dedication, but don't feel obligated to match my schedule."
"I want to help."
Ian returned to his office, and Jay continued working until Ian finally emerged at eight o'clock, briefcase in hand.
They rode the elevator down together. Jay noticed that scent again and had to resist the urge to breathe more deeply. The realization made him feel ridiculous—he was being weird about something as simple as cologne. He wondered what it was called, though asking would be presumptuous.
But it was pleasant. Comforting, echoing other moments when he had been close enough to Ian. When they had decorated the Christmas tree together, Ian reaching past him to hang ornaments. When Ian shook his hand, wishing him a happy New Year while they shared a glass of whiskey.
The elevator stopped at the ground floor, and Jay stepped out.
"Have a good evening, Ian."
"You too. Get some rest."
The elevator took Ian down to the underground garage where his car waited. Jay pushed through the lobby doors and stepped into the white world outside.
The snow had continued falling throughout the day, accumulating in thick drifts that softened every hard edge of the cityscape. The harsh sounds of traffic were muffled, creating an almost mystical tranquility. The streetlights created pools of golden illumination, making each flake visible as it drifted through the air. The city looked magical, like something from a postcard.
Jay remembered being seven years old, racing through snow while his mother called for him to come inside before he caught cold. Would he ever feel that pure joy again, that uncomplicated delight in winter weather? Or had the city permanently changed his relationship with snow, turning it into nothing more than an inconvenience that delayed trains and made commuting difficult?
The subway ran more smoothly on the return trip. When he reached his apartment, Jay still had energy to review materials for tomorrow's meetings. February was shaping up to be an intense month, with demands that would require his full attention.
He reheated his dinner and spread the papers across his small table, eating while reading through the reports. He worked for almost two hours. By the time he finished, his eyes ached from staring at numbers. As he got ready for bed, the memory of Ian’s cologne lingered faintly in his mind. All he could do was hope that tomorrow would at least bring a normal metro schedule.

Scene 2
New coat
Friday's temperatures seemed to bite through every layer of clothing. Jay pulled his old coat tighter as he hurried from the metro station, but the thin fabric did little to shield him from the arctic wind cutting between the buildings. The coat had served him sufficiently during previous winters, but those had been milder and with shorter commutes. 
The metro had been delayed again, adding another twenty minutes to his commute. Jay stamped his feet in the elevator, trying to restore circulation as he rode up to the thirty-fourth floor.
The office provided blessed relief from the cold, but the atmosphere was tense with deadline pressure. Reports needed completion and the workday felt compressed and frantic.
"Anyone interested in that new sushi place for lunch?" Kim asked during the morning break.
"Are you insane?" Luc replied without looking up from his computer. "It's freezing out there."
"Plus we don't have time," Amy added. "These projections won't finish themselves."
Max appeared with a stack of takeout menus. "Lotus Kitchen delivers quickly, and their portions are decent. Should we just order in again?"
The team agreed with weary resignation. The nearby Lotus Kitchen had become their default choice because they delivered within thirty minutes and the portions were large enough to sustain them through long afternoons.
Jay ate his wok noodles at his desk while reviewing a tricky spreadsheet. The office felt like a bunker where they had all taken shelter from the hostile world outside.
As afternoon faded into evening, it became clear that the traditional Friday drinks would be another casualty of the weather.
"Drinks are canceled," Ela announced to no one in particular. "I'm going straight home before my fingers freeze off."
"Same," Luc agreed. "Maybe next week if this arctic nightmare ends."
Jay stayed until eight-thirty, helping Ian finish a complex client request. When they finally called it a day, the building felt almost empty, their footsteps echoing in the marble lobby.
Outside, the cold was unrelenting. Jay hunched into his inadequate coat and hurried toward the metro, each breath forming clouds that dissipated instantly in the harsh wind.
The evening train was delayed, leaving Jay standing on the platform in temperatures that seemed to seep through his bones. By the time he reached his apartment, he was shivering uncontrollably, his old coat having been utterly useless against the brutal weather.
His apartment felt like a sanctuary. The heating worked reliably, and the insulation blocked out the worst of the wind that rattled the windows. But the cold had sunk deep into his bones, and even the warm air couldn't immediately dispel it.
He went straight to the kitchen and put milk on the stove, stirring in honey as it warmed. The sweet, creamy drink helped chase away some of the chill, and he cupped the mug in both hands, letting the warmth spread through his fingers.
Saturday morning brought no relief from the cold, but Jay had a mission. His old coat simply wouldn't survive another week of this weather, and he refused to spend the rest of winter shivering through his commutes.
He took the metro to the shopping district, targeting the more upscale department stores where quality might actually match price. The first few shops yielded nothing suitable—either too expensive even by his new standards, or lacking the warmth he desperately needed.
In the fourth store he visited, he found a wool overcoat that immediately caught his attention. The fabric was thick and well-constructed, with a weight that promised real warmth. The cut was classic, appropriate for his work environment.
The price tag made him pause. It felt extravagant, even with his improved salary. His frugal instincts, developed through years of budgeting, rebelled against the expense.
But as he tried it on, feeling how the sleeves fell at exactly the right length, he forced himself to remember that he could afford this now. His position at Turner & Associates paid well, and winter clothing was a legitimate necessity.
"It looks very nice," the sales associate said. "That's one of our best winter coats. The wool is treated for water resistance, and the lining is designed for temperatures well below freezing."
The matching scarf added another amount to the total, but it completed the ensemble and provided additional warmth for his neck and face. Jay paid with his card, trying not to wince at the cost.
Walking home in his new coat, he felt warm. The wind that had been cutting through his old jacket now barely registered. The investment was painful but necessary.
Sunday was gray and gloomy, making the apartment feel cramped and dreary. Outside his window, the wind howled between buildings, sending snow spiraling in patterns that might have been beautiful under different circumstances. But the heavy overcast sky drained color from everything, making even the fresh snow look gray and uninviting.
Jay spread his work materials across his dining table, determined to make progress on the projects that had been pushed aside during the week's chaos. The workload seemed heavier than ever, with everything demanding attention and detailed analysis.
He worked through the morning, breaking only for a quick breakfast. The early darkness outside created an oppressive atmosphere, making it feel like evening by mid-afternoon. The sound of wind and blowing snow provided a constant backdrop that made concentration difficult.
Lunch was a brief interruption—soup heated on the stove while he continued reviewing documents. The warmth helped counter the psychological chill of the gray day outside.
By evening, Jay had made progress, but his eyes were tired from reading financial reports under artificial light. The weekend had been productive but joyless, another casualty of the relentless weather. 
Winter was challenging . The cold was more severe, the commutes more difficult, and the workload more intense than anything he had previously experienced.
As he prepared for bed, Jay looked out his window at the snow-covered street below. The streetlights cast circles of light that illuminated the falling flakes, creating the same magical effect he had noticed earlier in the week. But tonight, the beauty felt alien and hostile.
Scene 3
Company card
February continued with workload that made even the most experienced team members question their career choices. Jay learned that this was the season when Turner & Associates truly earned its reputation—the first quarter demanded everything from everyone, and the office turned into a war room. Jay started arriving early each morning, just in case the metro was delayed again. Despite his long days, the work on his desk only seemed to multiply.
The reflection in the elevator's polished steel had shown him someone who belonged here. The tailored gray suit he wore today was one of three he'd purchased recently, paired with a white shirt that perfectly fit his frame. The wool overcoat completed the look.
"Welcome to the battlefield," Amy said one morning, dropping a stack of files on Jay's desk. "Hope you got enough sleep in January."
The office atmosphere tensed noticeably. The sharp but pleasant concentration disappeared, replaced by a nervous bustle, punctuated by the sound of printers working overtime.
He soon learned that this frenzy had a name—strategy season. The phrase was repeated often enough for him to understand it was important, though its exact meaning remained elusive. Apparently, each client required a final summary document by mid-March, along with a detailed, labyrinthine analysis that could make or break the year’s results. 
Jay nodded along whenever someone mentioned it, piecing together fragments from overheard conversations. He knew it mattered, even if he couldn’t quite explain how.
"Jay, do you have the analysis ready?" Ian called from his office.
"On your desk," Jay replied, not looking up from his screen. "I also pulled the comparative data."
Ian paused. "I didn't ask for comparative data."
"The numbers make more sense in context."
Ian smiled to himself. "Thank you."
Each day was busy, one spreadsheet after another. Jay stayed as late as Ian did, which meant most evenings stretched well past eight. Ian had stopped suggesting he leave earlier, a small victory that Jay treasured.
"Another late night?" Luc asked, passing Jay's desk with his coat already on.
"Seems that way."
"You know you don't have to prove anything anymore, right?"
"I'm not trying to prove anything. I just want to do the work well."
Luc watched him for a moment, then shrugged. "Fair enough. Don't burn out."
By Thursday of the second week of February, the strain was showing on everyone. Kim had snapped over a minor formatting issue. Even Max, typically unflappable, had muttered about early retirement while staring at his computer screen.
"Jay." Ian called from his office. "When you have a moment."
Jay gathered his tablet and the summary he was working on, stepping into the sanctuary of Ian's office.
"New client request came in," Ian said without looking up. "We'll need to restructure the Mayfield portfolio entirely. Can you block out the afternoon?"
"Of course." Jay made a note on his tablet. "Should I reschedule your three o'clock with the pension fund representatives?"
"Push it to tomorrow. This takes priority." Ian finally looked up, and Jay caught tension around his eyes. "It's going to be a long day."
"I'll let the team know we might need them to stay late again."
"They're going to mutiny. They’re running on fumes. Make sure they at least eat something."
Jay had been thinking the same thing. Walking past the desks earlier, he'd noticed the slumped shoulders, the way conversations had dwindled only to necessary exchanges. The pizza and noodle orders were becoming the new norm, but morale was clearly suffering.
"Actually," Jay said, "I had a thought about that."
"Oh?"
"People are tired of the takeout options. What if we ordered from somewhere special tonight? Something that feels less like survival food."
Ian leaned back in his chair, considering. "That's not a terrible idea. Do you have somewhere in mind?"
"There's a new place in the Harbour District. They do elevated comfort food. It's expensive, but it shows we value their time."
Ian reached into his desk drawer and pulled out a company credit card, sliding it across the mahogany surface. "Use this for tonight. And going forward, actually. For situations like this."
Jay stared at the card. "Are you sure?"
"You should handle this kind of thing. I should have given you this weeks ago, but I assumed you'd take the promotion and transfer to the regular team."
The card felt unexpectedly heavy in Jay's palm.
"Use your discretion. Within reason, of course, but don't worry about the expense if it helps productivity. I should have thought of this myself."
Jay pocketed the card. "I'll take care of it."
Jay spent the next twenty minutes browsing the menu, keeping in mind team's preferences he learned over the months of daily lunches.
The delivery arrived at seven, filling the kitchen with aromas that made everyone stop what they were doing. Jay had ordered generously: herb-crusted salmon, braised short ribs, roasted chicken with vegetables, and an array of sides that could satisfy various dietary preferences. The dessert selection included individual chocolate tarts and lemon possets that looked like they belonged in a magazine.
"This is incredible," Zoe said, loading her plate. "Where did you find this place?"
"I've been keeping a list of restaurants that deliver to the financial district," Jay admitted. "Research for situations like this."
Amy raised an eyebrow. "You research restaurants for work?"
"I research everything for work."
The kitchen filled with laughter. Even Ian appeared, surveying the spread with what might have been surprise.
"This looks excellent," he said, accepting a plate from Jay. "Thank you for organizing it."
Jay watched Ian choose from the options, selecting the salmon and steamed vegetables—a deviation from his strict meal planning, but not a dramatic one. The sight of Ian joining the team in the kitchen, standing among them while they ate and talked, created a warmth that had nothing to do with the hot food.
"We should do this more often," Kim said around a bite of short ribs. "Not the working late part, but the good food part."
"I'll make sure we're prepared for the next busy stretch," Jay said.
Work was temporarily forgotten in favor of comparing favorite restaurants and debating the merits of various cuisines. Jay was drawn into discussions about the city's food scene, contributing insights he'd gathered from his exploration of the neighborhood.
When they finally returned to their desks, the atmosphere lightened. The work remained demanding, but the sense of being in it together had strengthened. Jay made a mental note to research team management strategies during his weekends. He wanted to understand how to support Ian more effectively in situations like this. For now, he was content with the knowledge that he'd made a small difference in his team's difficult day.
As the office gradually emptied, Jay remained at his desk, finishing the client summary that would be needed first thing tomorrow. Ian worked in his office, the glow of his screen visible through the partially open door.
Scene 4
Planning
The pace of February left Jay with little mental capacity for anything beyond immediate work demands. Emails accumulated in his inbox faster than he could process them, and HR's stream of company announcements became background noise he barely registered.
When another message arrived with "Annual Company Retreat Update #3" in the subject line, Jay almost deleted it reflexively before remembering he should probably stay informed about major company events.
The email contained cheerful updates about the May retreat, complete with photos of the beachfront resort where they would spend three days. Pristine white sand stretched along turquoise water, while the hotel's amenities list read like something from a travel magazine—spa services, championship golf course, multiple restaurants, and evening entertainment that promised to be unforgettable.
Jay had submitted his application back in January when the first announcement arrived, filling out the basic form without giving it much thought. The retreat had seemed distant then, just another calendar entry to acknowledge and forget. But with HR's regular updates, the event kept surfacing in his consciousness like a recurring reminder of something he wasn't prepared to contemplate.
During the afternoon coffee break, he decided to ask his colleagues about their experiences with company retreats.
"I just read the retreat update. The place looks incredibly expensive."
"Oh, it is. Turner & Associates doesn't do anything halfway. You should see the budget they allocate for these things," Kim said.
Jay tried to imagine himself in such surroundings. "What exactly happens at these events?"
"Last year we went sailing. Instructors, fancy boats, the whole experience. The year before that was skiing in January. They actually flew us to a mountain lodge."
"And everyone goes?"
"Pretty much. It's not technically mandatory, but it's heavily encouraged. Plus we get Friday off, so it's basically a long weekend."
Amy joined the conversation. "The activities are actually fun. I know it sounds overwhelming, but they plan everything really well. Good food, interesting presentations, and enough free time to actually relax."
"What kind of activities are we talking about?"
"Beach volleyball, kayaking, wine tasting, cooking classes. They have a few options so you can pick what interests you. Trust me, after the winter we've had, three days of sunshine will feel like paradise."
Jay tried to picture himself participating in beach volleyball with senior executives and department heads. The image didn't come easily.
Luc wandered over, drawn by the conversation. "Are you worried about the retreat? It's not like the gala where you have to network and schmooze. It's much more casual."
"I'm just trying to wrap my head around the whole thing."
"The resort is ridiculous. But hey, if the company wants to spend money on pampering us, I'm not complaining."
"You'll love it," Ela assured him. "First company retreat is always special."
Jay managed a smile and returned to his desk, where another HR email waited with details about the April quarterly party. This announcement felt manageable—an evening event at a downtown venue, cocktails and dinner, nothing he hadn't handled before. After surviving the gala and various functions, a quarterly party seemed almost mundane.
"More corporate socializing," Ela commented, reading the same email. "At least this one won't have clients trying to corner us in hallways." 
The reference to Cruver made Jay momentarily uncomfortable, but the feeling passed quickly. The quarterly party would be mostly internal staff, which eliminated most of his anxiety about the event.
Another HR email arrived later that week, this one about vacation planning. Jay opened it while eating his desk lunch, more wok noodles that had lost any appeal weeks ago.
HR requested that everyone submit their preferred vacation dates by the end of March, but when Jay checked the team calendar, Ian's time off requests weren't listed yet.
As Ian's assistant, he wasn't sure whether he should coordinate his time off to coincide with Ian's or arrange it for when Ian wouldn't be in the office. The question felt important enough to warrant clarification, but not urgent enough to interrupt Ian's current crisis management. 
Jay decided to wait until Ian submitted his own plans, then match his timing accordingly. The decision could wait until their workload calmed down, whenever that might be. He marked the reminder for follow-up and returned to more pressing tasks.
Jay had no specific summer plans anyway. His previous vacations had been spent in his apartment, reading books he'd been meaning to finish and catching up on television series. Occasionally he would visit a museum or take walks through different neighborhoods, but nothing that required advance planning or major expenses.
The money he didn’t spend on travel went directly into his emergency savings. Security mattered more than adventure, especially given his previous employment disasters. He liked knowing he had more than one safety valve in place—different accounts, different contingencies. One of them was even literal: a discreet envelope of cash tucked away where no one would think to look, his last line of defense if everything else failed.
But the company retreat was different. It was mandatory in all but name, a three-day commitment to being social and engaged with colleagues in an environment designed for relaxation but likely to be exhausting.
Jay tried to imagine himself at the beachfront resort, participating in group activities and evening entertainment, making conversation over elaborate dinners. The image felt foreign, like trying to picture himself in someone else's life.
The team was still at their desks on Friday evening, working through another late session fueled by takeout containers. The winter had fallen into a pattern of brutal cold and heavy workloads that seemed designed to test everyone's endurance.
"I'm starting to forget what sunlight looks like," Max complained, reviewing a complex investment analysis under the harsh fluorescent lights.
"May can't come fast enough," Amy agreed. "Three days at a beach resort is sounding better every day."
Jay continued organizing files while listening to his colleagues discuss the retreat with anticipation. Their enthusiasm was reassuring, even if he couldn't quite share it.
The retreat remained an abstract concept, something to worry about when the immediate pressures subsided. For now, February's demands consumed his thoughts, leaving little room for contemplating extravagant resorts.
Jay finished his tasks and prepared to face another frigid commute home, thankful for his new coat and the warm apartment that awaited him. Summer planning could wait until summer felt possible.
Scene 5
Evening work
The office had emptied gradually throughout the evening, colleagues departing as their individual workloads permitted, calling out farewells that echoed in the gradually emptying space. Kim left first, followed by Ela, Luc and Zoe, then Max with a joke about "bankers' hours", and last Amy with a cheerful wave. The sounds of departure marked the transition from daytime to the quieter  evening hours when real work could be accomplished.
Ian remained at his desk, reviewing materials that demanded his complete attention. Complex calculations required uninterrupted focus, something the bustling daytime office rarely provided. He preferred these evening sessions when he could think without constant interruptions.
Jay never announced his intention to stay late or asked whether his assistance was needed. He simply remained, transitioning seamlessly from daytime tasks to evening support.
The emails continued arriving even after business hours—urgent requests from clients, updates from overseas markets, messages that demanded immediate attention despite the late hour. Jay monitored Ian's inbox, flagging critical communications and sorting less urgent matters for morning review. His organizational system had evolved over the months, no longer requiring oversight.
When documents needed printing, Jay handled them without being asked. Contracts requiring signatures appeared on Ian's desk with relevant sections highlighted. The small post-it notes written in careful handwriting had become Jay's trademark, each containing exactly the information needed—reference numbers, modification details, deadline reminders.
"The Greenwell portfolio needs restructuring," Ian said, more to himself than to Jay.
"The last review flagged concerns about the tech sector allocation," Jay replied without looking up from his computer. "I pulled the performance data this morning. It's in the folder on your desk."
Ian retrieved the folder, finding exactly the information he needed. Jay had anticipated the requirement before Ian had fully articulated it, a development that had become increasingly common as the months passed.
"Thank you. Anything urgent in the evening emails?"
"Everest Capital wants to schedule a call for Monday morning. I've booked them at ten. Gelundis Fiduciary sent the documents you requested. I've printed them and placed them on your desk."
Jay's responses were always like this, succinct and comprehensive. Jay understood the flow of Ian's work, the priorities that mattered, the details that could wait. The learning curve had been steep initially, but now Jay functioned like an extension of Ian's own organizational system.
Ian noticed Jay's eyes drift to his empty coffee cup, saw the slight furrow of concern that appeared when Ian worked too long without a break. Jay never presumed to offer refreshments or suggest rest, but his worry was evident in his expression. But Ian made a point of refilling his own coffee. Jay was his assistant, not his servant, and Ian refused to blur that distinction regardless of Jay's obvious willingness to help with anything requested.
For years, working late had been a solitary grind, necessary but joyless, sustained by determination. The office became a tomb after hours. Now, Jay changed the atmosphere. He provided something Ian hadn't realized he was missing—silent, supportive companionship. He moved through the office quietly, never interrupting Ian's concentration but always being available when assistance was needed. He delivered documents during Ian's natural pause points and seemed to sense when Ian needed space to think. Jay never complained about the long hours, never seemed impatient to leave, never made Ian feel guilty for the demanding schedule. 
But the guilt remained. Jay's dedication seemed boundless, his willingness to stay overtime and handle demanding tasks both impressive and troubling. Ian wondered whether he was taking advantage of Jay's eagerness to please, whether the young man felt pressured to exceed normal expectations which wasn't fair or sustainable.
Yet Ian couldn't bring himself to send Jay home earlier. The Friday evening stretched, and Ian extended their work sessions simply to postpone the return to his empty penthouse.
"Ian. And Jay." Leo's voice interrupted Ian's thoughts as his friend appeared in the office doorway. His visits had become less frequent since the new year chaos began—perhaps his mysterious schedule had intensified as well.
Jay looked up from his computer, acknowledging Leo with a polite nod. Without a word, he rose from his desk and walked toward the kitchen area, clearly intending to give them privacy for their conversation.
Ian watched Jay's retreat with amusement. Over the months, Jay had developed an obvious wariness toward Leo that manifested in blatant avoidance. Jay remained courteous, but he made no effort to encourage casual interaction and seemed to take every opportunity to remove himself from Leo's vicinity.
"Your assistant is remarkably discreet," Leo observed, sitting on the chair across from Ian's desk.
"He is."
"And devoted."
Ian's expression hardened. "If you have something specific to discuss, please get to the point."
"You have to admit, the arrangement is working splendidly. You look more relaxed than I've seen you in years."
"The workload requires extended hours. Jay understands that."
"Does he? Or does he simply enjoy spending time with his boss? Either way, at least you're not working yourself to death in solitary misery anymore. When work becomes indistinguishable from leisure, one can hardly call it a hardship."
"That's enough," Ian said sharply. "You're reading entirely too much into it."
"I'm just pleased to see you looking less exhausted than you did six months ago."
Ian wanted to argue, to deny Leo's implications, but he was unable to formulate a convincing rebuttal. It was true that work had become more enjoyable since Jay's arrival. Even during those early months when suspicion coloured every interaction, the dynamic had felt invigorating.
His initial reservations about Jay now seemed not just unfounded but actively foolish. Jay's shyness, his obvious intimidation by the office's grandeur and his colleagues' credentials, his almost painful dedication to performing every task perfectly—all of it was disarming, making suspicion impossible to maintain.
Ian had watched obsessively during those first weeks, cataloguing every interaction and analysing every response. But Jay's awkwardness was too genuine to manufacture, his gratitude too heartfelt to be fake. The young man's reactions to praise, his visible relief when tasks were completed successfully—none of it could be performed that convincingly.
"He's competent," Ian said, unwilling to elaborate further.
"He's more than competent. He's exactly what you needed. Just remember to occasionally acknowledge that fact. Even perfect assistants require recognition."
After Leo left, Jay returned from the kitchen, sitting back at his desk without comment or question about the conversation he had deliberately avoided.
Ian continued working, acutely aware of the way Jay turned what should have been tedious late-evening drudgery into tender contentment. Jay was, by any reasonable measure, a gem—rare, valuable, and deserving of careful handling. The question was whether Ian was providing the appreciation he warranted, or whether he was simply taking advantage of Jay's generous nature.
Jay had become an integral part of Ian's daily life, which Ian was only starting to fully recognize. The realization was both comforting and concerning. Ian did his best to keep emotional distance, but Jay was undermining those defences without Ian quite understanding how or when it had happened.
Chapter 12: Stormy weather
Scene 1
Stormy morning
The storm hit the city with fury that made it feel personal. Freezing rain pelted the windows of Jay's apartment at five-thirty in the morning, and by six, the power had went out completely. He dressed by the light of his phone, checking transit updates that grew increasingly dire with each refresh.
"Metro suspended on all lines due to power outages. Estimated restoration time unknown."
Jay had left his apartment twenty minutes earlier than usual, anticipating delays, but he hadn't counted on the sheer violence of the weather. The streets were rivers of slush and ice, and the few buses running were packed beyond capacity. By the time he reached the financial district, the expensive wool coat was already damp and heavy, the supposed waterproofing no match for the winter storm. His shoes squelched with every step, and he was forty-five minutes late.
He'd sent Ian a text: "Power outage in my area. Metro suspended. Will be late but coming in as soon as possible."
The response had been immediate: "Don't worry about it. Be safe."
But Jay did worry about it. In almost seven months at Turner & Associates, he'd never been late. Not once. The sick feeling in his stomach had nothing to do with the cold.
Standing outside the Northlight Financial Center, drenched and shivering, Jay spotted a boutique across the street with its lights already on. The elegant script on the window read "Hathaway's Menswear" and under normal circumstances, he would have walked past without a second glance. The place sold sweaters for thousands to men who thought nothing of such expenses.
But these weren't normal circumstances.
The bell chimed softly as he entered, water dripping from his coat onto the pristine floor. A well-dressed clerk appeared immediately, taking in Jay's bedraggled state with composure.
"I need a complete change of clothes. Everything. I’m a size 46 jacket, medium shirt, 80 waist, and size 42 shoes.”
The clerk's expression didn't change. "Certainly, sir. Business attire?"
"Yes. And I'm in a hurry."
Within minutes, the man had assembled a selection: cream trousers that looked like they'd been cut from silk, a white shirt with subtle texture, a charcoal blazer that felt impossibly soft, leather shoes that gleamed despite the store's dim lighting, and undergarments still in their packaging.
"Will you be trying these on?"
Jay glanced at his phone. Nearly nine o'clock. "No time. I'll take them."
The total made his chest tighten. More than he'd spent on clothing in the past year combined. But he handed over his card anyway, too rushed and miserable to properly process the financial damage.
The Turner & Associates lobby felt like a sanctuary after the chaos outside. Jay's shoes squelched against the marble as he approached the elevators, acutely aware of the water trail he was leaving behind. The elevator ride to the thirty-fourth floor felt endless.
The office was half-full, with various team members shaking off coats and complaining about the commute. Ela looked up from her desk, her perfect hair slightly mussed.
"This weather is insane," she said. "I saw three accidents between my house and here."
Jay managed a weak smile and headed straight for Ian's office. The door was open, and Ian sat at his desk looking as immaculate as ever, not a hair out of place. Of course. He probably had a driver who delivered him directly to the underground garage.
"I'm sorry I'm late," Jay said from the doorway.
Ian looked up with barely disguised concern. "You look like you swam here."
"I might have. I need to go change my clothes."
"Go. There are towels in the executive bathroom." Jay caught the underlying worry in his voice. "Take your time."
The executive bathroom was a revelation Jay had never fully appreciated. Thick, hotel-quality towels hung from heated racks, and the space felt more like a spa than an office facility. Jay stripped out of his soaked clothing, toweling off his hair and trying to warm his chilled skin.
The new clothes fit perfectly, which was either remarkable luck or a testament to the clerk's expertise. The trousers moved with him like they'd been tailored, and the shirt felt like wearing a cloud. The shoes were comfortable despite being unworn, and everything coordinated with elegance that Jay had never achieved in his life.
He caught his reflection in the mirror and barely recognized himself. The clothes flattered him, highlighting his frame. The cut of the trousers made his legs look longer. He looked expensive. Polished.
It was too much. Too obvious. But his regular clothes hung dripping from the towel rack, and he had no other options.
When he returned to his desk, a steaming mug waited for him. Ian emerged from his office, holding his own cup.
"Ginger tea," Ian said. "From my personal supply. It's good for warming up."
"Thank you."
Ian's voice sounded slightly strained. "The storm is supposed to continue through the afternoon. If you need to leave early—"
"I'll be fine." Jay sipped the tea, surprised by its complexity. Not the simple ginger tea he'd expected, but something layered with honey and spices that warmed him from the inside out. "This is excellent."
"My housekeeper makes it." Ian seemed to be looking everywhere except directly at Jay. "She insists it prevents illness."
Jay sat at his desk, opening his laptop. Checking emails and reviewing Ian's schedule felt grounding after the morning's chaos. He was aware of how the new clothes moved with him, how the fabric felt against his skin, but he pushed the awareness aside. Work was work, regardless of what he wore.
From his office, Ian stole glances at his assistant, then forced himself to look away. Jay had always been attractive, but these clothes revealed what had been hidden beneath his wardrobe, and his still-damp hair gave him a tousled look that was unexpectedly appealing.
Ian gripped his coffee cup tighter and focused on his computer screen. This was exactly the reaction he'd trained himself to avoid. But Jay looked... God, he looked incredible. And completely unaware of it, which somehow made it worse.
Ian closed his eyes briefly, then opened them and forced himself to concentrate on work. The storm outside continued to rage, but the real tempest was happening inside his chest, where feelings he'd been suppressing threatened to overwhelm his defenses.
At his desk, Jay worked, occasionally glancing toward Ian's office when he thought no one was looking. The ginger tea warmed him and gradually, the morning's disasters faded into memory.
He had no idea that Ian was fighting the strongest urge he'd felt in years—the desire to cross the space between them, to touch Jay's hair, to discover if those new clothes felt as good as they looked.
Scene 2
Discomfort
Jay was three hours into his regular workday when Luc appeared at his desk with a peculiar expression on his face.
"Okay, I have to ask. When did you decide to switch careers to menswear modeling?"
Jay's fingers paused over his keyboard. "What?"
"This whole look." Luc gestured at Jay's outfit. "Very successful young executive with mysterious past."
"It's just clothes. Emergency replacements after this morning's disaster."
"Emergency replacements that probably cost more than my car."
"Close. About two paychecks worth. If it wasn't so embarrassing, I'd return them."
"Return them? Are you insane? You absolutely cannot return them. They're worth every penny. You look... You look so good I'm suddenly questioning my sexuality."
Jay managed a weak smile, but his chest tightened with discomfort. "That's a disturbing thought for both of us."
"I'm serious though. You should keep these for special occasions. Dates. You'd sweep anyone off their feet."
Jay's smile felt brittle. "Right. Special occasions."
He thought about his empty social calendar, his studio apartment where he spent most evenings alone. The clothes were beautiful, expensive, and completely wasted on someone who had no intention of impressing anyone. His love life was a deliberately barren landscape, and he intended to keep it that way.
Loneliness could be sharp sometimes, cutting through the quiet of his apartment. But it was still infinitely preferable to the discomfort of relationships, the vulnerability they demanded, the ways they could go wrong.
"Anyway," Luc continued, oblivious to Jay's internal spiral, "emergency or not, you look fantastic. Don't let it go to waste."
After Luc left, Jay was hyper-aware of every movement, every glance from colleagues, every reflection in the elevator doors. The clothes felt like a costume now, drawing attention he didn't want and couldn't handle. He pulled at the sleeves, trying to make it feel less fitted, less obvious. 
Amy walked past his desk and did a double-take. "New wardrobe?"
"Emergency purchase," Jay said quickly.
"Well, it looks great."
Each compliment felt like a weight added to his shoulders. He wasn't used to being noticed, didn't want to be noticed. The expensive fabric felt like a spotlight, highlighting everything he'd rather keep hidden. He knew his coworkers meant well, but being on display made his skin crawl.
The self-consciousness continued for the rest of the day. Jay threw himself into work with extra concentration, hoping to distract himself from the way people looked at him differently.
Ian, meanwhile, found concentration impossible. Every time Jay moved past his office, every glimpse of those perfectly fitted trousers sent his mind spiraling into territories he'd sworn off. He stared at the curve of Jay's neck when he leaned over files, the way the fabric moved across his shoulders when he reached for something.
By four o'clock, Ian had reread the same report three times without absorbing a single word. He closed his laptop with more force than necessary and rubbed his temples, trying to banish the increasingly vivid images that kept surfacing despite his best efforts.
This was exactly what he'd feared the most when Leo first suggested hiring Jay. Not the corporate espionage—that had been a convenient excuse. This. The way attraction could undermine years of self-control, how it could make even the most disciplined person lose perspective.
Jay wasn't Sam. Jay was earnest, hardworking, and completely uninterested in him. And that made it worse, because it meant Ian's feelings weren't just inappropriate—they were unwanted.
Jay was relieved when five arrived. He gathered his things quickly, eager to escape the day's accumulated discomfort. The storm had passed, leaving the city washed clean but still bitter cold.
Outside, he flagged a taxi without hesitation. If he'd taken a taxi this morning instead of relying on the public transport, none of this would have happened. The ride would have been inconvenient but manageable. Instead, his penny-pinching had cost him thousands in emergency clothing.
The taxi pulled up to his building, and Jay paid the fare without mentally calculating the metro alternative. Some lessons were expensive.
In his apartment, he hung the designer clothes with excessive care, spacing them properly in his closet. They looked absurd next to his regular wardrobe—like artefacts from someone else's life. He found a large zip-lock bag and sealed them inside, double-checking the closure. If these were going to represent two months of his salary, he'd make damn sure nothing happened to them.
He made a mental list: keep a spare suit at the office, always take taxis in bad weather, never again underestimate the city's capacity for chaos. The emergency fund he'd been building could absorb this hit, but it still stung.
As he heated leftover soup for dinner, Jay turned over the day's strange dichotomy in his mind. He'd looked better than he ever had in his life, and it had made him miserable. The compliments felt like spotlights, the attention like judgement. He preferred the invisibility, the safety of blending in.
At the other end of the city, Ian stood in his pristine kitchen, staring at a glass of wine he'd poured but hadn't touched. The image of Jay in kept surfacing, no matter how many times he pushed it down. The way the trousers had followed the line of his body, the flush in his cheeks from the cold and tea.
Ian had spent years building walls that had kept him safe and successful. But watching Jay work today had shaken something loose. The fantasies that followed were persistent, scenarios of slowly removing those beautiful clothes, discovering the body beneath, learning how his skin might feel and how he might respond to being touched.
He drained the wine in one swallow and headed for his home gym. Perhaps exhaustion could accomplish what discipline hadn't.
In his small apartment, Jay changed into something comfortable and tried to forget about designer fabrics and unwanted attention. Tomorrow he'd return to anonymity, and the expensive clothes would remain safely sealed in their plastic bag, waiting for a special occasion that would never come.
Neither man slept well that night, though for very different reasons.
Scene 3
Fever
Jay woke the next morning with a scratchy throat and a headache that felt like someone had wrapped his skull in cotton. He dismissed it as lingering stress from the previous day's financial disaster, downing extra coffee and forcing himself through his morning tasks.
By afternoon, the headache had evolved into something more sinister. His body ached, and he shivered despite the office's consistent temperature. When he stood to deliver files to Ian's office, the world tilted slightly.
"Are you feeling alright?" Ian asked, looking up from his desk. "You look pale."
"I'm fine," Jay said automatically, though his voice sounded rough. "Just tired."
Ian's expression remained sceptical, but he didn't press. Jay returned to his desk and pushed through the remaining hours with sheer determination, ignoring the way his vision seemed to blur around the edges. He didn’t stay late that day. As soon as the workday ended, he returned home, ate his reheated dinner with a dose of paracetamol, and went to bed early, hoping whatever he was coming down with wasn’t anything serious.
The next morning brought no ambiguity. Jay woke with a fever that made his apartment feel like an arctic wasteland, his throat feeling like sandpaper, and every muscle in his body screaming protest when he tried to sit up. The sound of his alarm felt distant, as if it were coming from underwater. He reached for his phone with trembling fingers, squinting at the bright screen that made his head pound worse. 
He should be getting ready for work, should be preparing for another day of managing Ian's schedule and sorting through the endless stream of reports. Instead, he could barely lift his head from the pillow without the room spinning.
The simple act of getting to his work phone required tremendous effort. He waited until seven-thirty and dialed Ian's number with shaking fingers, dreading the conversation.
"Jay? What's wrong?"
"I'm not feeling well. I won't be in today. I'm sorry for the short notice." The admission felt like failure.
"You sound terrible. Have you seen a doctor?"
"Not yet. It's probably just flu."
"Call your doctor immediately. Don't try to push through this. Take whatever time you need to recover properly."
"I can work from home if you need anything urgent."
"Absolutely not." Ian's tone brooked no argument. "Rest. The work will wait."
Jay wanted to protest, to insist he could handle whatever needed handling, but fever made coherent thought impossible. "I'll check my email—"
"No, you won't. That's an order."
After hanging up, Jay collapsed back onto his pillow, frustrated by his own weakness. The timing couldn't have been worse—the crushing workload demanded all hands on deck, and here he was, laid low by his own carelessness. Getting drenched in the storm had been stupid enough, but he'd been pushing himself too hard for weeks, while his immune system surrendered.
Finding medical care was overwhelming. He had a general practitioner, but getting an appointment required leaving home. The thought of sitting in a waiting room filled with other sick people made him feel worse.
After twenty minutes of dealing with automated phone systems while his fever spiked higher, he managed to secure a telehealth appointment for that afternoon. The doctor would call him at two o'clock, which meant he had hours to endure the mounting symptoms alone.
The doctor called precisely on time. "Describe your symptoms, please."
"Fever, chills, sore throat, body aches. Everything hurts."
"How long have you been experiencing these symptoms?"
"I woke up with them this morning, but I felt tired yesterday. Thought it was just the workload."
"Any nausea or difficulty breathing?"
"Some nausea. Breathing is okay, just tired."
The doctor asked several more questions about his symptoms and medical history before delivering the diagnosis. "This sounds like influenza. I'm prescribing antiviral medication and something for the fever. You'll need to stay home until you're fever-free. Given the severity of your symptoms, expect to be out of work for at least a week, possibly longer."
A week. Jay tried to process the information through his fever-fogged brain. Ian would have to manage without him during one of their busiest periods.
"I'm sending the prescriptions to your preferred pharmacy. The antiviral will help reduce the duration if you start it within the first forty-eight hours."
Jay gave her the information for the pharmacy near his apartment, then realized with growing panic that he had no way to get there. The thought of getting dressed and standing in line at the pharmacy felt impossible in his current state.
After the call ended, he spent thirty minutes researching delivery options. Most pharmacies offered same-day delivery for an additional fee, but the earliest available slot was six o'clock that evening.
He ordered the delivery service with shaking hands, entering his card information twice because the numbers kept blurring together. The extra charges for express delivery felt steep, but he had no alternative.
The wait until evening stretched endlessly. Jay alternated between burning fever and violent chills, wrapping himself in every blanket he owned only to throw them off minutes later when the heat became unbearable. He managed to drink water and nibble crackers, but solid food felt impossible with his inflamed throat.
The delivery arrived at six-thirty, and Jay answered the door in his bathrobe, accepting the pharmacy bag with hands that trembled so badly the delivery person looked concerned.
"You okay, man? You look really rough."
"Just the flu," Jay managed, closing the door and leaning against it for support.
The medications provided some relief, but recovery was slow and miserable. Jay lost track of days, existing in a haze of fever dreams interrupted by coughing fits. He drifted in and out of sleep, sometimes forgetting where he was, once waking convinced he was late for an important meeting that existed only in his delirious imagination. 
The weather outside matched his internal state. February was ending with a wet, gray dissolution as the accumulated snow melted into dirty slush that clogged the gutters and made the streets treacherous. From his window, Jay watched pedestrians cross the mess with careful steps, their faces hidden behind scarves and hoods.
He felt similarly liquefied, as if the fever had melted his composure and left him as shapeless and gray as the slush outside. Tasks like taking medication or ordering food required enormous effort. Showering was impossible, he could barely stand long enough to brush his teeth.
The apartment grew stuffy and cluttered as takeout containers accumulated on every surface—soup from the place nearby, bland rice dishes he could barely swallow, tea that went cold before he remembered to drink it.
By Sunday, the fever had broken, but the exhaustion remained crushing. Jay could think more clearly, which only made him more aware of the disaster his apartment had become. Empty containers covered the coffee table and kitchen counter, used tissues overflowed from the wastebasket, and dirty clothes lay where he had dropped them during fevered attempts to regulate his body temperature. The mess felt overwhelming, another symptom of his solitary existence. No one had checked on him, no one had brought soup or offered to run errands.
Ian had sent one text on Friday asking about his condition, and Jay had responded that he was following doctor's orders to rest and will take the next week off. No further communication had followed, which was appropriate given their relationship, but it contributed to the isolation that seemed to permeate everything. His work phone sat on the table, and he'd meant to keep it charged, but in his fevered state, he'd failed to plug it in properly. By Monday, it was dead.
Scene 4
Worry
Meanwhile, Ian discovered the true extent of his dependence on Jay. Tasks that Jay handled seamlessly now required Ian's direct attention, pulling him away from higher-level responsibilities.
But it was more than just inconvenience. The office felt empty without Jay at the desk outside his door. Ian kept glancing up from his work, expecting to see Jay's head bent over his computer.
"You're brooding," Leo observed, appearing in Ian's doorway Monday afternoon.
"I'm working."
"You're staring at your computer like it personally offended you. Missing your assistant?"
Ian's jaw tightened. "He's been out sick since Thursday."
"Have you called to check on him?"
"It's not appropriate."
"Since when do you care about appropriate?"
Ian turned back to his screen, but he couldn't focus. Leo was right, though Ian would never admit it. He'd been fighting the urge to call Jay every few hours, to drive to his apartment and check on him personally. The knowledge that Jay was alone in the city, with no family nearby, only made it worse.
By Wednesday, Ian's restraint was wearing thin. He'd called Jay's number twice, getting voicemail both times. The rational part of his mind knew that people got sick, that Jay was probably fine and just needed rest. But the irrational part imagined worst-case scenarios.
What if Jay's fever had spiked dangerously? What if he'd collapsed in his apartment with no one to help? What if—
Ian forced himself to stop. They weren't that close. Jay was his assistant, nothing more. Showing up at his apartment would be an overreach that would make them both uncomfortable. But knowing that didn't make the worry go away.
Thursday brought no word from Jay. Ian checked his phone constantly, jumping every time it buzzed. He'd composed and deleted a dozen text messages, each one crossing lines he wasn't sure he had the right to cross.
By Friday, Ian was barely functional. He'd called Jay's number twice more, each time going straight to voicemail.
He tried to focus on reports, on client calls, on the mundane tasks that Jay filtered and organized. But his attention kept drifting to the empty desk outside his office, to the unanswered phone calls, to the uncomfortable realization that somewhere along the way, Jay had become more than just competent support. Jay had become necessary. The office without him felt wrong.
The waiting felt like torture, and the concern that gnawed at him had very little to do with missed deadlines or disrupted schedules. It had everything to do with the way Jay's absence had revealed how much space he'd carved out in Ian's carefully ordered world.
Ian's phone buzzed against his desk. Jay's name appeared on the screen, and Ian's heart rate spiked embarrassingly.
"I'm feeling better and should be back Monday. Sorry for the extended absence."
Ian stared at the message, relief flooding through him. He wanted to type a dozen questions. Are you sure you're better? Do you need anything? Have you been eating?
Instead, he typed: "Take the weekend to recover fully. See you Monday."
It was appropriate and completely inadequate for what he wanted to say. Ian set his phone down and closed his eyes, finally allowing himself to breathe properly.
Jay set his phone aside and returned to the soup he'd been forcing himself to eat. Monday would come whether he was ready or not, and he needed to be strong enough to face the accumulated work waiting for him.
The past week felt like a dream now that his temperature had finally normalized. Days were filled with aching muscles and throat pain, broken only by the arrival of soup deliveries and the struggle to swallow medication. He started to feel better around Wednesday, but he'd still spent most of the time in bed, too weak to do anything productive.
Friday was the first day he'd felt fully human again, which meant confronting the disaster his apartment had become. Empty takeout containers covered every flat surface, laundry was scattered across the bedroom floor, and the sink was full of dishes he'd been too exhausted to wash. The air felt stale and sickly, and Jay realized he haven't opened the windows in over a week.
He tackled the cleanup, working in short bursts with rest breaks between tasks. Throwing away the accumulated trash took two trips to the building's dumpster. Doing the dishes required sitting on a kitchen stool to manage the dizziness. 
He found his company phone buried under a pile of used tissues on the nightstand, completely dead. The sight of the black screen triggered a flutter of anxiety. What if Ian had needed something urgent? What if there had been crisis situations requiring his attention? He plugged the phone into its charger and waited for it to power on, mentally preparing for a flood of missed calls and urgent messages. When the screen finally illuminated, he found four missed calls from Ian and texts from Luc and Amy wishing him fast recovery. He immediately sent a message to Ian and was relieved to get a quick reply—clearly, nothing too urgent had happened. He also let his colleagues know he would be back on Monday.
The much needed shower refreshed him both physically and mentally. Hot water washed away the staleness of sick days, and clean clothes felt like putting on a new identity. Jay looked at himself in the bathroom mirror and was startled by how pale and thin he looked. A week of barely eating had carved hollows under his eyes.
By evening, the apartment was habitable again, though far from pristine. Jay had managed to change his sheets, and the fresh air from the open windows had cleared out the worst of the stagnant atmosphere. Sleeping in clean bedding after days of fevered restlessness was soothing.
On Saturday he had enough energy for a shopping expedition. Jay wrapped himself in his winter coat and ventured to the grocery store, moving slowly through the aisles and  supporting himself on the shopping cart. He bought fresh fruit, vegetables, and ingredients for simple meals, foods that would help rebuild his strength after a week of living on soup and crackers.
The outside world felt overwhelming after days of isolation. Colors seemed too bright, sounds too loud, and the brief shopping trip left him exhausted. But it was proof that his body was healing.
On Sunday morning Jay stood in his kitchen and prepared a proper meal, scrambled eggs with fresh herbs, toast made from good bread, and freshly squeezed orange juice that tasted like sunshine after days of cold tea.
The breakfast tasted amazing after endless containers of mediocre takeout soup. Each bite held flavor and substance that reminded him why real food mattered, why taking care of himself was worth the effort even when no one else would notice.
Jay finished his meal and began planning the week ahead. Laundry needed completing, his work clothes required pressing, and he should prepare for whatever had accumulated during his absence. The illness had passed, his strength was returning, and normal life waited to resume.
He cleaned his dishes, putting his kitchen back in proper order. His ability to handle domestic tasks was evidence that he was truly better and not just managing symptoms. By evening, his apartment mirrored his recovery—clean, organized, ready for whatever came next.
Scene 5
Recovery
Jay stood in front of his bathroom mirror on Monday morning, adjusting the tie. He'd dressed in one of his elegant suits he'd purchased in January—conservative gray that made him look unremarkable. 
He looked pale in the morning light, his face thinner than it had been the previous week. The fever had burned through him completely, but he was functional and ready to return to work.
He arrived at Northlight Financial Center at eight o'clock—a deliberate choice to ease back into his workday.
The elevator ride to the thirty-fourth floor felt unusually long, his legs unsteady from a week of fever-induced inactivity. He'd managed to keep down solid food for two days running, which felt like a victory worth celebrating.
Ian's office was already illuminated when Jay reached his desk, and he could see Ian's silhouette through the glass. The sight brought unexpected comfort—some things, at least, remained constant.
Ian had been in his office since seven-thirty, checking his watch with increasing frequency as eight o'clock approached. When Jay failed to appear at an early hour, a knot of worry had formed in Ian's stomach. The relief he felt seeing Jay emerge from the elevator was massive.
Jay had barely sat on his chair when Ian appeared in his doorway with an expression Jay couldn't quite read.
"Good morning," Jay said. "I'll have your schedule updated within the hour."
"You're back," Ian said.
"Yes." Jay's voice still had a slight rasp, but it was worlds better than the sandpaper croak of the previous week. "I'm sorry for being out so long."
"You look..." Ian paused, clearly editing his words. "How are you feeling?"
"Much better. Thank you for your patience with the sick leave."
"Of course." Ian watched him intensely. Jay knew he didn't look great, but Ian's scrutiny felt like it went deeper than surface observations. "I'll be right back," Ian said abruptly, disappearing into his office.
Jay opened his laptop and began checking emails. A week's worth of messages awaited his attention, but Ian had handled the most urgent matters in his absence.
Ian returned with a large bag that looked suspicious. "Care package," he said, setting it on Jay's desk. "Standard procedure for assistants returning from illness."
Jay opened the package to find an impressive array of items: the same ginger tea that had warmed him during the storm, bottles of vitamins and supplements, packets of dried fruits and nuts, protein drinks, throat lozenges, and what looked like enough cold medicine to stock a pharmacy.
"This is... a lot," Jay said. "Thank you."
"My housekeeper insisted." 
"Standard procedure?"
"Of course."
Jay doubted that Ian had ever given a care package to any previous assistant, but he wasn't about to call attention to the inconsistency. "I appreciate it. Really."
"Make sure you use everything. Full recovery is important."
"I'll make sure to use everything," Jay agreed, though privately he wondered where he'd store it all in his small apartment.
"Good." Ian hesitated, then added, "Don't stay late this week. And don't come in early. Full recovery means proper rest."
"I understand."
As Ian returned to his office and Jay went about his business, he felt a warmth that had nothing to do with the ginger tea he was already brewing. The care package was evidence that his well-being mattered to someone.
The office was deep in the grip of March's demands, with everyone moving at the accelerated pace. Jay eased back into his tasks gradually, prioritizing the important assignments and letting less urgent matters wait.
The rest of the week passed on self-care. Ian insisted Jay maintain regular hours, no early arrivals or late departures until he was fully recovered. Jay didn't argue, recognizing that his previous approach to work-life balance had been unsustainable. Jay arrived at eight and left at five, taking taxis instead of the public transport, ignoring the daily assault on his budget. Despite his scepticism about their effectiveness, he swallowed the vitamins Ian had provided, drank the ginger tea, and went to bed at reasonable hours instead of staying up late to tackle additional work.
It felt strange, prioritizing his health over productivity. But Ian monitored his schedule, and Jay appreciated the gesture.
The work itself was manageable. Jay focused on Ian's most immediate needs. Ian seemed content with this arrangement, never pressing for more than Jay could comfortably handle.
"You're looking better," Amy mentioned on Wednesday, stopping by Jay's desk.
"Thank you. I feel better."
"Good. You scared us disappearing for a week like that."
Jay managed a smile. "I'll try to avoid it in the future."
But despite the recovery, Jay was subdued. The illness had stripped away more than just physical strength, it had reminded him of his fundamental isolation in the city. A week of fever-induced solitude had driven home the reality that he had no safety net beyond his own resources.
The care package from Ian had been a bright spot, but it also highlighted what was missing. Courteous gestures couldn’t fill the void left by the absence of real connections.
Ian noticed Jay's mood and told himself it was simply the lingering effects of illness. People took time to bounce back from the flu, especially when they'd been pushing themselves too hard beforehand. Spring would arrive eventually, bringing longer days and warmer weather, and Jay would recover his spirit.
But privately, Ian worried. Jay's pale complexion and sluggish movement indicated he was fighting to regain his strength. The way he rationed his energy spoke to a deeper exhaustion than simple physical strain.
"Are you sleeping better?" Ian asked on Friday afternoon as Jay prepared to leave.
"Yes, thank you. The supplements are helping."
"Good. Don't push yourself too hard."
Jay nodded and gathered his things. "I'll see you on Monday."
Ian watched him go, fighting the urge to say more. There were questions he wanted to ask, but they would cross lines he'd drawn for good reason. Jay was his assistant, not his friend, and certainly not anything more than that. The concern felt inappropriate, but Ian couldn't shake the feeling that Jay needed more support than he was receiving.
Jay had established a new order—sustainable, healthy, but somehow diminished. He performed his duties with typical competence, but the eager dedication that had once driven him to arrive early and stay late was gone.
Ian told himself this was probably better. More balanced. Healthier. But he missed the Jay who had stayed late by choice, who had brought an atmosphere to the office that Ian was only now realizing he'd come to depend on.
Chapter 13: Ides of March
Scene 1
Lunch discord
March came with the promise of spring that never materialized. The temperatures had crept up enough to melt most of the snow, but what remained was a persistent chill accompanied by dampness that seemed to seep through every layer of clothing. Gray skies stretched endlessly overhead, broken only by intermittent drizzle that made every outdoor excursion feel like a calculated risk.
The team had begun to cautiously revive their daily walks to nearby restaurants for lunch, venturing out whenever the weather and workload permitted. The outings had been on hold for weeks, because of heavy snow and mounting deadlines, and while neither had improved much, the conditions were tolerable enough, and everyone was tired of takeout eaten at their desks.
Jay still had lingering congestion and his voice held traces of hoarseness. His first week back, he avoided the lunch expeditions entirely, choosing instead sandwiches from the bakery he had discovered during those December days when he and Luc had eaten in the office kitchen.
The sandwiches were substantial—thick slices of fresh bread filled with quality meats and vegetables that made them feel like proper meals. Jay ate at his workspace, reluctant to test his recovering immune system against March's unpredictable weather.
"You sure you don't want to join us?" Luc asked on Wednesday, pulling on his jacket. "We're just going around the corner."
"I think I'll stick with staying dry today," Jay replied, unwrapping his turkey and swiss. "The cold air might trigger another coughing fit. Maybe next week when I'm feeling completely back to normal."
By his second week, Jay felt ready to rejoin the team's lunch outings, but he quickly discovered that the winter's isolation had affected more than just his health. The carefree atmosphere that had characterized their group outings before his illness had developed fractures that exposed everyone's frayed nerves.
"Where are we thinking today?" Amy asked on Monday, checking the weather app on her phone with visible frustration.
"Let's keep it simple. That pasta place nearby. Quick walk, good food, we're back within an hour," Luc said.
Kim looked up from his computer with obvious irritation. "We've been there five times in the past two weeks. There's a new fusion place that opened on Fifth Street that's supposed to be excellent."
"Fifth Street is a ten-minute walk each way in this weather," Luc countered. "Look outside—it's starting to drizzle again."
Amy stood at the window, watching drops streak down the glass. "Maybe we should just order in today. I really don't want to get soaked."
"We've been ordering takeout constantly," Kim replied. "I'm tired of eating soggy noodles from containers. Can't we make an effort to go somewhere decent for once?"
Jay watched the exchange with growing discomfort. The conversation held an edge of irritation that hadn't been present in their previous lunch discussions. Everyone seemed to be operating with shortened patience and elevated frustration levels.
"The pasta place is fine with me," Jay offered diplomatically.
They ended up at the nearest option, but Kim grumbled throughout the meal about the limited menu and predictable atmosphere. The pasta was well-prepared, but Kim's dissatisfaction cast a shadow over the entire lunch that left everyone feeling vaguely annoyed.
On Tuesday skies were clearer, and Kim immediately pushed for his fusion restaurant choice. Luc agreed reluctantly, muttering about the walk and the likelihood that they'd end up rushing back through puddles.
The fusion place turned out to serve inventive dishes in an atmosphere that was both trendy and comfortable, but the longer walk meant they had to eat quickly to return on time. Luc complained about the pace throughout the meal and continued his criticism during the walk back, noting every wet patch they had to cross and every gust of cold wind that cut through their jackets.
"The food was good," Amy said, clearly trying to defuse the tension. "Maybe we can come back when the weather improves."
"If the weather ever improves," Luc replied darkly.
Wednesday brought heavy rain that made outdoor dining impossible. They ordered from the Lotus Kitchen again, but the delivery arrived forty-five minutes late with lukewarm food that had clearly sat in the delivery vehicle too long. The noodles were congealed, the spring rolls soggy, and everyone ate in frustrated silence while watching the rain pound against the office windows.
Jay was caught between his colleagues' competing preferences and deteriorating moods. He tried to remain amiable, agreeing with whoever spoke first and avoiding any comments that might add to the tension. He worried about seeming difficult or high-maintenance by expressing preferences that might complicate the group's already strained decision-making process.
The atmosphere was fragile. Perhaps it was the accumulated stress of the harsh winter and heavy workload, or maybe the persistent gloominess of March's weather was affecting everyone's mood. Whatever the cause, the friendships that had sustained them through previous challenges now seemed strained by the mundane challenge of choosing where to eat lunch.
Through it all, Ian remained completely unaffected by the team's dining dilemmas. He ate his portioned meals at exactly one each day, sitting in the office kitchen with containers that were expertly prepared. The contents varied—sometimes grilled chicken with vegetables, occasionally salmon with quinoa, always balanced and deliberately planned.
Ian never participated in the lunch discussions or seemed bothered by the rain, the cold, or the team's fluctuating moods. His habits remained unchanged regardless of external circumstances, a consistency that Jay found comforting amid the general atmospheric tension.
March was shaping up to be one of the most challenging months Jay had experienced at Turner & Associates. His health was slowly improving, but the combination of persistent weather, workplace stress, and the team's unusual discord created an environment that felt more difficult.
Jay's energy levels remained inconsistent, good days alternating with afternoons when his stamina flagged without warning. The lingering effects of his illness made the gloomy weather feel more oppressive, as if the external atmosphere was amplifying his internal sense of depletion.
At least April was only a few weeks away, and with it the promise of better weather and the quarterly party that might help restore some of the team's camaraderie. For now, Jay focused on diplomatic neutrality and looked forward to the day when choosing a lunch destination would once again be a simple matter of preference.
Scene 2
Failure
The phone call came at three-fifteen on a Thursday, interrupting Ian's review of cash flow forecasts. The lawyer's voice was measured but held urgency that immediately commanded attention.
"We needed that compliance document by noon today, Ian. The deadline was absolute."
"Which document?"
"Subscription agreement addendum for Lagerstrom Holdings. I sent the reminder last week with all the specifics."
Ian pulled up his calendar, scanning for any mention of the deadline. Nothing appeared in his scheduled tasks or flagged emails. "Let me check my communications and call you back."
After ending the call, Ian searched his email inbox systematically. The Lagerstrom Holdings reminder wasn't in his priority folder or his pending actions list. He expanded his search to include all messages from the past two weeks and found it buried in his general inbox, marked as non-urgent.
Ian stared at the email, reading the requirements. The message should have been flagged immediately as high priority, scheduled on his calendar, and followed up with reminder notifications. Instead, it had been categorized as unimportant correspondence and forgotten.
He knew he’d have to bring it to Jay’s attention. Under normal circumstances, it would be a straightforward correction—point out the mistake, explain the proper procedure, and move on. But with Jay still looking pale from his recent illness, Ian was wary of making him dwell on it. The message had to be delivered without softening the facts, yet without making it seem like a disaster.
"Jay, could I speak with you for a moment?" Ian appeared at Jay's desk later that afternoon.
"Of course." Jay looked up from the client reports he had been reviewing, immediately sensing tension in Ian's posture.
They walked to Ian's office, and Ian closed the door before sitting behind his desk. Jay sat down, trying to read Ian's expression for clues about what might have gone wrong.
"There was an issue with Lagerstrom Holdings filing," Ian began. "The deadline was yesterday, and we missed it."
Jay felt his stomach drop.
"The law firm sent notification about the requirement last Tuesday. It was flagged as non-urgent."
The memory hit Jay like cold water. The legal email with its ambiguous subject and dense content, filed away as something that could wait for attention during less hectic periods.
"I'm sorry. I misunderstood the importance."
"Legal communications can be deliberately unclear. The subject lines rarely indicate urgency, and the language is often unnecessarily complex. It's a common challenge, even for experts."
Jay appreciated Ian's attempt to soften the criticism, but the fact remained—he had made a serious error that had real consequences. "What happens now?"
"We'll file a late submission with penalty fees. The client relationship isn't damaged, but it's an unnecessary expense and administrative complication. Going forward, when you're uncertain about a message's importance, the default should always be to flag it for my review."
"I understand."
"Mistakes happen, Jay. The important thing is learning from them and implementing systems to prevent repetition."
Jay managed to nod, but inside he felt like he was crumbling. Ian's patience and constructive approach only highlighted the trust he had violated and the standards he had failed to meet.
"I know. I'll be more careful."
"I'm confident you will be. This was an oversight, not a pattern."
"Is there anything else?" Jay asked in a  strained voice. Ian's reassurance seemed to make him feel worse, as though kindness was harder to bear than criticism.
"No, that covers it."
Jay returned to his desk with rigid movements. Ian watched him sit on his chair and resume working, looking like he was fighting back tears.
By five, Jay was relieved his recent illness had set the expectation that he’d leave at a normal hour. The thought of remaining in the office while struggling to maintain composure felt unbearable. He packed his things  and headed for the metro.
He walked to the station with his head down, replaying the conversation and trying to understand how he had made such a fundamental error. The legal email had seemed unimportant when he'd scanned it, but Ian was right—he should have read it more carefully, should have erred on the side of caution.
It wasn't his first mistake since starting the job. There had been moments when his inexperience showed despite his best efforts. Ian had always been patient with his errors, offering guidance without making him feel incompetent. But this felt different, more serious.
The metro was crowded with commuters, but Jay barely noticed the press of bodies around him. He stared at his reflection in the dark window, seeing someone who looked tired and defeated.
His apartment felt like a refuge when he finally reached it, like a sanctuary where he could safely fall apart. He went straight to his bed and pulled the covers over his head, seeking darkness and isolation from the world that had once again proven too challenging for his capabilities.
The past few weeks had been testing him to a degree he wasn't sure he could handle. The workload, the endless winter, office tensions, persistent illness, and now a failure that called into question everything he thought he had achieved.
Maybe he wasn't cut out for this work after all. Maybe Max's original assessment had been correct, and Jay was nothing more than a joke hire who had temporarily fooled everyone, including himself, into believing he belonged in such a prestigious environment.
The thought of facing Ian tomorrow, of sitting at his desk and trying to act normal while knowing he had disappointed the one person whose respect mattered most, was unbearable. How could he maintain composure when everything pointed to his inadequacy?
Eventually, hunger forced him from bed. Jay reheated his dinner and ate it slouched on the couch, too disconcerted to care about table manners. The food was tasteless, just fuel to sustain him through another evening of self-doubt. He left the dishes in the sink for the night, unable to muster his sense of order. 
The shower helped slightly, the hot water washing away some of the day's tension if not its underlying problems. Jay prepared his clothes for tomorrow with extra care, checking every detail to ensure nothing could go wrong with his appearance. He couldn't give Ian any reason to question his commitment.
Scene 3
Hot chocolate with rum
Jay arrived at the office fifteen minutes early, hoping the extra time would help him compose himself before facing his colleagues. He wore a smile that felt like a mask stretched too tight across his face. Every greeting required conscious effort, every interaction a performance designed to convince people he wasn't falling apart internally.
The effort was unsuccessful.
"Good morning, Jay," Amy said brightly as she passed his desk.
"Good morning!" Jay replied with forced enthusiasm. The smile he had rehearsed felt like a grimace, and Amy's brief look of confusion confirmed his failure to appear normal. Each forced moment of cheerfulness only highlighted his underlying distress.
Ian called him into his office at nine-thirty for their daily briefing, his manner unchanged from any other morning. He reviewed the day's schedule and asked Jay to prepare materials for an afternoon meeting.
Jay found Ian's consistency both comforting and unsettling. Part of him had expected different treatment—perhaps coolness or increased oversight—but Ian behaved exactly as he had the day before the mistake. The normalcy felt like a gift, proof that Ian still trusted him despite yesterday's failure.
But it also left Jay uncertain about where he stood. He wanted reassurance, wanted someone to tell him that mistakes were survivable and that his position was secure. Did Ian's unchanged behavior mean the mistake was truly forgiven, or was he simply maintaining decorum while privately reassessing Jay's capabilities?
Ian, meanwhile, struggled with his own internal conflict. From his office, he could see Jay's rigid posture and forced interactions, could practically feel the anxiety radiating from his desk. Every instinct told Ian to offer comfort, to find ways to demonstrate that the incident was insignificant.
His management training argued for different approach. Drawing more attention to the error might make Jay feel worse, might signal that the mistake was more serious than Ian had indicated. Better to demonstrate through behavior that their relationship remained stable.
Ian knew his concern went beyond appropriate managerial interest in team morale. He was worried about Jay specifically, personally, and it had nothing to do with work and everything to do with the young man's obvious distress.
Lunch provided no relief for Jay. The weather had finally begun to soften, with temperatures climbing and rain subsiding. The team was less grumpy about venturing outside, and they chose a restaurant that actually served appealing food.
But Jay could barely taste his meal. The conversation around him felt distant and unimportant, and his contributions were stilted. He questioned every comment, second-guessing responses that would have been natural weeks ago.
"Everything alright?" Ela asked during a lull in conversation.
"Fine," Jay said quickly. "I slept poorly. Must be the change of weather."
The lie was obvious to everyone at the table, but no one pressed for details.
Back at the office, Jay tried to lose himself in administrative tasks, but concentration remained elusive. Every email required multiple readings, every decision felt fraught with potential for additional mistakes.
"Jay?" Luc appeared at his desk around three o'clock, clearly concerned. "Can I talk to you for a minute?"
They walked to a quiet corner of the break room, away from the afternoon bustle.
"Is everything okay? You look like your pet just died."
Despite himself, Jay smiled at the dark humor. "I'm fine."
"No, you're really not. What's going on?"
Jay's composure finally cracked. "I made a serious mistake yesterday. Missed an important deadline because I misclassified an email. Ian was very patient about it, but..."
"But you're beating yourself up. Jay, these things happen. Trust me, whatever you did wasn't that serious in the grand scheme of things."
"It cost the company money. It was a compliance issue."
"So? Missed deadlines are part of business. We pay fees and move on. It's not career-ending."
Jay wanted to believe him, but the mistake felt too major to dismiss. 
"I let Ian down. He's been so patient with my learning curve, and I repaid that trust by screwing up something important." 
"Jay, if Ian fired everyone who made filing mistakes, this office would be empty. Trust me, you're not the first person to misread a legal notice."
At five, Luc appeared at Jay's desk again. "Come on. Let me buy you a drink. You need to get out of your head."
"I should probably just go home."
"Absolutely not. You're going to sit in your apartment and spiral into a depression about one mistake. That's not happening on my watch."
They walked together through the gradually warming streets, and Jay discovered that Luc lived remarkably close to the office.
"Fifteen-minute walk," Luc explained. "One metro stop if the weather's really terrible. I love this neighborhood, even though the rent is insane. The convenience is worth it."
He led Jay down a narrow side street to a small cafe tucked between a bookstore and a vintage clothing shop. The interior was warm and dimly lit, with atmosphere that invited long conversations.
"Two hot chocolates," Luc told the server. "With rum. And extra whipped cream."
"I don't drink during the week," Jay protested.
"Trust me. Nothing lifts the mood like chocolate, alcohol, and dairy products combined. This place makes the best hot chocolate in the city. Thick enough to stand a spoon in."
The hot chocolate arrived in enormous mugs, topped with clouds of whipped cream and dusted with cinnamon. It was absurdly rich and warming, the rum adding just enough heat to chase away the lingering chill of winter and worry.
"When I first started at Turner & Associates, I sent a confidential client report to the wrong email address. Complete security breach. The client was furious, compliance had to get involved, and I thought I was going to be fired on the spot."
"What happened?"
"Ian handled it masterfully. Took full responsibility, smoothed things over with the client, and then sat me down to review email protocols. My hands were shaking for a week afterward, but he never made me feel like an idiot. A missed deadline is nothing compared to that."
The warmth from the drink was spreading through Jay's chest, and he felt his shoulders relax slightly.
"I just don't want to disappoint him," Jay admitted.
"You won't. Ian values competence and dedication, both of which you have in abundance. One mistake doesn't erase months of great work."
The cafe's gentle atmosphere worked its magic on Jay's frayed nerves. The hot chocolate was exactly what he hadn't known he needed, comforting and shared with someone who understood the pressures of their work environment.
"Thank you," Jay said as they prepared to leave. "This really helped."
"Anytime. We all need someone to remind us that mistakes aren't the end of the world."
The walk back to the metro felt better than yesterday. Jay's mood remained dampened, but the tight knot of anxiety in his chest had loosened. Luc's perspective had provided exactly the reassurance that Jay had been unable to manufacture.
By the time Jay reached his apartment, he felt better. The mistake still troubled him, and tomorrow would still require more vigilance, but perhaps he could face it without the crushing weight of shame that had dominated his thoughts since yesterday afternoon.
Scene 4
Justice
By the end of the week, Jay stopped being so tense and his smile no longer required conscious effort to maintain. The immediate crisis of the missed deadline had passed, leaving behind a manageable residue of embarrassment and heightened caution. The crushing despair that had threatened to consume him seemed overdramatic in retrospect.
He had implemented a new system for email management—a final review of the non-urgent folder at the end of the day to catch any misfiled communications before they could cause problems. The additional step felt like insurance against future mistakes, a small price to pay for peace of mind.
"Looking better," Amy observed during their Friday afternoon coffee break. "Whatever was bothering you earlier seems to be resolving."
"Just had a rough patch. These things pass," Jay replied, and he meant it. Mistakes happened because he was human, not because he was inept. The important thing was learning from errors and implementing systems to prevent repetition. Luc's perspective had helped him understand that career included setbacks as well as successes.
Ian watched this progression with relief. Jay's recovery was proceeding exactly as it should—initial distress followed by practical adjustment and renewed determination. Ian’s choice to continue normal treatment instead of hovering with reassurance turned out to be right.
Luc's intervention had been supportive and perfectly timed. Ian wondered that perhaps Luc deserved recognition for his handling of a sensitive situation. A raise, maybe. 
He caught himself mid-thought and frowned. That was excessive. Luc had simply shown basic collegiality toward a distressed teammate. The situation had resolved naturally through peer-level intervention, nothing more.
He was giving the matter too much attention, creating significance where none existed. Jay was a valued employee who had made a mistake, received guidance, and moved forward. The end. But even as Ian told himself these things, he knew they were excuses. 
Thankfully, he didn't have much time to examine his feelings too deeply. His thoughts had been occupied lately by an entirely different matter, one that had nothing to do with filing systems and everything to do with a man named Ric Cruver, who had cornered Jay at the company gala three months ago.
Orrey Capital Partners maintained accounts worth tens of millions annually to Turner & Associates. They weren't handled by Ian's team directly, but fell under the firm's broader portfolio of institutional clients. Terminating such relationships required justification and senior management approval.
Ian had spent the past three months building that justification.
It had started with research—reviewing Orrey's public filings, examining their transaction patterns. Most companies had irregularities if you knew where to look, and Ian possessed both the expertise and motivation to look very thoroughly indeed.
The first discovery had been relatively minor—dubious accounting practices that didn't quite cross legal lines. Interesting but insufficient grounds for termination. Ian had continued digging. 
The months of investigation had yielded exactly what Ian had expected to find. The company presented a respectable facade that concealed ethical compromises typical of firms that employed predatory individuals in client-facing roles.
Offshore transfers through shell companies. Regulatory filings submitted with suspicious timing. Board members with connections to recently sanctioned entities. Individually, these elements might be explained as aggressive but legal business practices. Together, they created a pattern pointing to deeper issues.
The corruption Ian had uncovered was the final nail in the coffin. Orrey had apparently facilitated payments to overseas officials through a complex series of investment vehicles that provided plausible cover for what were essentially bribes. The transactions were sophisticated enough to avoid obvious detection, but transparent enough that any serious investigation would expose their true nature.
Ian had been careful to build his case through legitimate channels. Anonymous tips to regulatory agencies. Conversations with former Orrey employees who were willing to discuss their experiences. Public records requests that revealed inconsistencies in official statements.
Three weeks ago, a preliminary investigation had been opened. The inquiry was still confidential, but Ian had sources who kept him informed about such developments.
Yesterday, a former Orrey accountant had agreed to cooperate with investigators, providing documentation of internal practices that violated several regulations. The investigation was about to become very public and very serious.
Ian reviewed the memo he had prepared for Turner Senior one final time. The language was dry, focusing on valid business risks.
"Recent regulatory developments concerning Orrey Capital Partners require immediate attention. A formal investigation into the company's practices has been initiated, with particular focus on offshore transaction structures and reporting irregularities. Given the scope of the investigation and potential reputational risks to Turner & Associates, I recommend reviewing our client relationship."
The memo made no mention of Ric Cruver specifically, though Ian had no doubt that a man who would harass people at a corporate event was exactly the type to work for a company with ethical problems. Birds of a feather, as the saying went.
Ian had uncovered corruption through entirely legitimate means. The fact that his investigation had been motivated by personal reasons didn't invalidate the evidence or make his recommendations inappropriate. Orrey Capital Partners deserved whatever consequences their business practices brought them.
And if Cruver ended up unemployed when Orrey inevitably collapsed under regulatory scrutiny, well, that was simply karma operating as it should.
Ian signed the memo and placed it in his outgoing correspondence. Turner Senior would receive it Monday morning, along with supporting documentation that painted a clear picture of a client relationship that had become a liability.
Once submitted, the process would move quickly. Turner Senior trusted Ian's judgment on risk assessment, and the documented evidence was compelling enough to support immediate action. Within a week, Orrey would receive formal notification that Turner & Associates was terminating their business relationship. Cruver would lose his primary justification for attending Turner & Associates events, eliminating any future opportunity for him to come in contact with Jay. 
Jay continued reviewing emails at his desk, completely unaware that Ian had spent three months systematically destroying the life of the man who had made him uncomfortable at a corporate party. Ian intended to keep it that way. Jay didn't need to know about Cruver's impending downfall, just as he didn't need to know that Ian had been unable to forget the sight of Jay's terrified eyes that January evening. Ian returned to his work, confident that one problem was soon to be permanently resolved.
Scene 5
Orrey Fallout
Weather turned mild on the last Monday of March, and Jay's spirits had lifted as he walked to work without needing to brace against bitter wind. His new coat, which had been essential for survival during February's brutal cold, now felt almost too warm in the spring air. The lingering traces of his winter illness had finally disappeared. The sting of his mistake had faded.
The office atmosphere mirrored the seasonal change. Lunch plans were made with enthusiasm, and even Luc cracked jokes that didn't have undertones of weather-related misery.
Around ten-thirty, whispers began circulating through the entire floor. Jay caught fragments of conversations—mentions of investigations, regulatory problems, client relationships under review. The gossip network that connected Turner & Associates was subtle, and news was spreading quickly about something big.
"Jay," Luc appeared at his desk with a coffee cup. "Coffee break. I need to ask you about something."
They went to the kitchen and sat on chairs near the windows, while the coffee machine worked in the background as they talked.
"So," Luc began, "what do you know about Orrey Capital Partners?"
"Should I know something about them?"
"Come on, you manage Ian's email. There's no way you haven't seen communications about what's happening with them."
Even if Jay had seen such emails—which he hadn't, beyond the standard correspondence—he wouldn't have shared details with anyone. Ian's communications were confidential, and Jay treated them with the same discretion he would expect from a doctor or lawyer.
"I haven't seen anything unusual," Jay said honestly. "Why?"
"Word is spreading that Turner & Associates just terminated their relationship. Apparently there's some kind of investigation. Major scandal brewing."
Client terminations were rare events, and clearly serious enough to generate office-wide discussion when they occurred.
"That's only the third time in company history," Luc continued. "Last time was before either of us worked here. It's a big deal."
Amy conspicuously entered the kitchen and joined the conversation. "Official investigation. Major compliance violations, possible criminal charges. Turner Senior decided to cut ties immediately so we don't risk association."
"That's... a lot," Jay muttered.
As the day progressed, the Orrey situation dominated conversation. By lunch, everyone knew that a formal investigation has been opened. The team even changed their choice of restaurant for the day, opting for a small place with dim lighting and music just loud enough to cover hushed voices. Plates of butter chicken sat cooling as conversation circled endlessly around the same points: who had known what, who was likely to be implicated, who might already be cooperating with investigators.
Max claimed to know some of the Orrey partners by name. Luc kept prompting him for more gossip. Every revelation earned a chorus of murmured disbelief or dark amusement, as though the group couldn’t decide whether to be appalled or impressed.
Jay mostly listened. By the time they returned to the office, the Orrey scandal had grown in scope and consequence, reshaped by every retelling. Later that afternoon, details were emerging about offshore transactions and regulatory violations that painted a picture of systematic corruption.
Jay recalled Ric Cruver and felt a surge of vindictive pleasure. The man who had cornered him at the gala worked for a company now facing federal investigation. There was poetic justice in that development.
On Tuesday Ian called for an official team meeting where he formally announced Turner & Associates' decision to terminate the Orrey relationship.
"Effective immediately, we will no longer provide services to Orrey Capital Partners," Ian explained to the assembled staff. "The ongoing investigation presents reputational risks that outweigh any financial benefits of maintaining the relationship."
"What kind of investigation?" Max asked.
"Securities fraud, money laundering, violations of offshore reporting requirements. The scope is impressive."
Jay felt visible relief wash over him. Never having to see Cruver again, never having to worry about encountering him at corporate events, felt like an unexpected gift from the universe. His removal eliminated a source of background anxiety he was only now recognizing. Spring really was bringing good news.
Since Ian's team hadn't directly handled the Orrey account, the termination wouldn't create additional workload for them. But Ian, as CFO, was deeply involved in the transition process, and Jay noticed an immediate increase in legal emails and regulatory correspondence crossing his desk.
Jay flagged every Orrey-related message as urgent. Whatever bureaucratic complications arose from severing ties with corrupt clients, he was determined to ensure Ian had immediate access to all relevant information.
By Friday, major newspapers were reporting on the investigation. They ran a detailed analysis of Orrey's business practices and explored the broader implications for investment management oversight. Turner & Associates was mentioned favourably for their prompt action in distancing themselves from the scandal.
"We dodged a bullet," Ela observed during the afternoon break. "Being associated with this kind of mess would have been a nightmare."
Jay saw Ian read the newspaper coverage. Turner & Associates' reputation remained intact, their decisive action viewed as prudent risk management. But Ian still followed the news with concern.
Ian remembered his own scandal years earlier—the tabloid headlines, the invasive coverage, the way reporters had dissected every detail of his personal life when his relationship with Sam Connelly had exploded into public view. The ruthlessness with which his private affairs had been turned into entertainment for people who didn't know him.
Ian thought he had deserved the consequences. His poor judgement had created the mess entirely. The media attention had been brutal but expected—a natural result of his own foolishness.
Orrey's senior staff would face similar scrutiny, but Ian felt no sympathy for their situation. Unlike his own case, caused by naivety and lack of experience, Orrey's problems stemmed from deliberate corruption and ethical violations. They deserved whatever consequences their actions brought.
But the memory served as a sharp reminder of why personal feelings had no place in the workplace. Ian watched Jay organizing the latest batch of Orrey correspondence, clearly pleased that Cruver's employer was facing investigation and disgrace.
Jay looked better. The combination of improving weather, recovered health, and seeing his harasser's company destroyed had lifted his spirits. Ian was glad to see Jay's confidence returning, but the sight also reinforced his determination to maintain distance.
He could not afford to develop feelings for Jay, no matter how much he enjoyed the young man's company or how protective he felt about his well-being. The Orrey situation had worked out well, but it also demonstrated how quickly personal feelings could drive his decisions. Strictly business, he reminded himself. That was the only safe path forward.
Chapter 14: Spring
Scene 1
Quaterly reports
Bonus?
The beginning of April meant the crushing reality of quarterly reporting deadlines. Jay had experienced two previous quarters since joining Turner & Associates, but his newbie status had insulated him from fully understanding what the process demanded. He had observed his colleagues working longer hours and drinking more coffee, but hadn't grasped the true scope of the ordeal. In October, he had been employed for only two months, handing peripheral tasks without grasping the magnitude of the chaos, while the senior staff managed the critical work. January's year-end crunch had been spread over longer periods, with annual reports following more forgiving timelines than their quarterly counterparts.
The warning signs had been evident throughout the previous week. Overtime became standard, takeout containers once again accumulated in bins, and conversations grew increasingly terse as stress mounted. But Jay had been too absorbed in the Orrey scandal to fully register the building tension. Cruver's downfall had provided distraction from the approaching deadline storm.
Now, with April's first Monday stretching ahead like a battlefield, Jay understood what his colleagues meant when they spoke about quarterly reports with the same tone others reserved for natural disasters.
The office atmosphere was electric with stress. Conversations were reduced to essential communications. Lunch breaks disappeared entirely, replaced by hastily consumed sandwiches eaten at desks while reviewing spreadsheets. The office banter died away, leaving only the sound of keyboards, printers, and the occasional frustrated curse when numbers didn't reconcile properly.
Jay resumed his early arrivals without being asked, arriving at seven to find Ian already at his desk with coffee that indicated he had been there for some time. The change felt necessary—there was simply too much work to accomplish during normal business hours.
"Good morning," Jay said quietly, not wanting to disturb Ian's concentration.
Ian looked up with visible relief. "Thank you for coming in early."
"I figured you could use the support."
"I can. This is going to be an intense week."
Jay organized materials, flagged urgent communications, and handled administrative tasks that would otherwise take Ian's time during critical analysis periods. Everything felt secondary to the quarterly reports that consumed the office's collective focus.
The rest of the team had arrived by eight, each person bearing the determination of soldiers preparing for siege.
Jay spent the morning shuttling between departments, delivering documents, coordinating meetings, and handling the tasks that kept the reporting process functioning. His role had expanded beyond supporting Ian to serving as a general assistant for anyone who needed help maintaining their sanity during the crunch.
Ten PM arrived without anyone acknowledging the hour. Ian remained hunched over his computer, and Jay continued managing correspondence, prepared for this level of sustained effort by his previous experience with late nights.
When Jay finally left the office at eleven-thirty, Ian was still working. The pattern continued Tuesday through Thursday—Jay arriving at seven to find Ian already present, leaving at ten or later while Ian remained behind to refine reports that would be scrutinized by clients, regulators, and senior management.
Jay handled responsibilities he had never imagined fell within his job description. Coordinating with IT when servers crashed under the load of simultaneous report generation. Liaising with building security when access cards malfunctioned during a late-night work session. Managing food deliveries for a team too busy to leave their desks for meals.
By Friday, Jay understood why his colleagues had looked like zombies during previous quarters. Sleep became a scarce commodity. He would return to his apartment near midnight, shower quickly, and collapse into bed for five hours before the alarm demanded another day of relentless focus.
The weekend brought no respite. The entire team assembled in the office on Saturday morning, working through analyses that couldn't wait for Monday's continuation. Jay had never worked weekends before, but the experience felt like a rite of passage—proof that he truly belonged to the team that pushed through impossible deadlines together.
"First weekend crunch?" Max asked as they walked to the elevator.
"Yeah. I had no idea it would be this intense."
"The quarterly bonuses exist for a reason. These hours aren't sustainable without proper compensation."
Jay had wondered about the quarterly bonus system, thinking it seemed generous when he first learned about it. Now he understood it was hazard pay for surviving periods when work consumed every waking hour and personal life ceased to exist.
Sunday was marginally less frantic, but only because the most critical analyses were nearing completion. Jay spent the day formatting reports and ensuring all supporting documentation was properly organized. Ian moved through the office like a man possessed, reviewing every detail.
By Sunday evening, Jay felt a bone-deep exhaustion he had never experienced before. The physical fatigue was manageable, but the mental strain of maintaining perfect accuracy while operating on minimal sleep left him feeling hollowed out.
"We're almost through it," Luc said, appearing at Jay's desk with yet another cup of coffee. "Tuesday morning everything gets submitted, and we can return to merely overwhelming workloads instead of impossible ones."
"How do you do this every quarter?"
"Practice. And the knowledge that it's temporary. Plus the bonus makes the suffering worthwhile."
Jay glanced toward Ian's office, where the light burned as it had for days. Ian's dedication was absolute, his focus unshakeable even when exhaustion was clearly taking its toll. Jay had stayed late and arrived early, but Ian had been there before him every morning and remained after he left every night.
The realization that Ian was pushing himself even harder than the rest of them filled Jay with concern and admiration in equal measure. This was leadership—not just directing others through difficult periods, but bearing the heaviest burden personally.
Jay returned to his formatting tasks, determined to handle every possible detail so Ian could focus on the complex analysis work that only he could complete. If Ian was going to sacrifice sleep and personal time to meet their deadlines, Jay would ensure that sacrifice wasn't wasted on mundane tasks he could manage himself.
Tuesday finally arrived, and  Jay watched Ian submit the final file at six PM, then slump back in his chair exhausted. With it came the completion of reports that represented three months of complex financial management distilled into documents that would be scrutinized, analysed, and filed away until the next quarterly deadline demanded similar sacrifice.
Scene 2
Retreat arrangement
The insane workload of the first quarter was finally easing. The office atmosphere lightened, though everyone remained busy enough to still feel the strain.
Another quarterly party was approaching, and Jay was calm about it. The company events no longer felt like elaborate tests of his social adequacy. Eight months of experience had taught him what to expect—a sophisticated gathering with some clients, but nothing like the intimidating gala that had left him shaken in January. His colleagues, even those from other departments, had always treated him with respect.
The May retreat, however, remained a source of persistent anxiety. HR's continued updates painted a picture of three days of opulence that sounded simultaneously appealing and terrifying. Jay had cautiously asked his colleagues what to expect, hoping for reassurance.
"It's actually fun. Not like those corporate retreats where you have to do trust falls." Ela said.
Their enthusiasm did little to ease Jay's concerns about spending an entire weekend in such an intimidating environment with his colleagues.
The latest email from HR brought an unexpected twist: in the spirit of teamwork and mentorship, senior employees were encouraged to pair with junior ones for the trip. Everyone would be sharing a room—something that rarely happened at these events, where private accommodations were the norm. The change was presented as a way to promote better integration, though it seemed to catch most by surprise.
Jay watched as his team began to sort themselves out. Ela immediately claimed Kim, with whom she regularly socialized outside work, even if she was technically only a year ahead of him. Amy, one of the most senior employees, paired with Zoe, who had joined just over three years ago, before Luc. 
“You should stay with Max,” Luc said to Jay. “I can find someone in another department.”
“That works for me. Even out the numbers.” Max added cheerfully. 
Jay felt gratitude for his colleagues' consideration, but before he could respond, Leo appeared in their workspace with a grin that immediately put everyone on alert.
"Perfect timing," Leo announced. "I've been thinking about the retreat room assignments, and I have a brilliant idea."
Ian emerged from his office, clearly recognizing the tone. "Leo, what are you planning?"
"Team integration," Leo continued, undeterred. "The CFO should set an example by sharing a room with his assistant. Perfect even numbers, no one gets stuck with strangers, and it demonstrates that we're all equals here."
The silence that followed was deafening. Jay felt heat rise in his cheeks as he processed Leo's suggestion, immediately certain that Ian would find the idea appalling.
"That's completely inappropriate," Ian said, his voice tight with barely controlled anger.
Jay's stomach dropped. Of course Ian wouldn't want to share a room with him. "He's right," Jay said quickly. "It would be completely unthinkable for the CFO to stay in a room with someone of my calibre. Or with anyone at all, for that matter."
The hurt in Jay's voice was unmistakable, and Ian's expression fell. Leo's grin widened.
"Actually," Leo said smoothly, "all the C-suite managers are participating. I'm rooming with my junior staffer, and we've encouraged the same throughout the company. It's about breaking down hierarchies, not reinforcing them."
"Max would be the obvious choice for Ian," Amy said uncertainly.
"But that's hardly in the spirit of integration," Leo replied. "Max is already senior staff. Pairing with junior employees like Luc promotes better teamwork practices. Don't you think, Max?"
Max's jovial laugh filled the awkward silence. "Brilliant idea, Leo. Nothing builds team spirit like sharing a bathroom for three days."
"The rooms are quite spacious," Leo added. "Employee comfort is paramount. Two beds, sitting area, private balcony. No one will be roughing it."
Ian's jaw was clenched so tightly Jay worried he might crack a tooth. "I don't have any concerns beyond the well-being of my subordinates. I don't want to make anyone uncomfortable."
"Then it's decided," Leo said brightly. "I'll make the arrangements with HR immediately. This is going to be fun."
He departed with obvious glee, leaving behind a group of colleagues trying to process what had just happened.
"Jay," Luc said quietly, "if this makes you uncomfortable, I'll talk to Ian. Leo can be put in his place."
"I'm not uncomfortable," Jay said, though his voice lacked conviction. "I just don't think I'm quite worthy of sharing a room with Ian."
Luc laughed. "Ian's not a medieval lord, Jay. We're all coworkers of the same standing. He can be intimidating, but—"
"He's not intimidating," Jay interrupted. "He's stern, but he's very comfortable to be around."
"Alright then," Luc said with a smile. "You'll have a great time."
Jay nodded, trying to convince himself that was true. At least he knew Ian was trustworthy and kind. Whatever his reservations about the arrangement, Jay was certain he wouldn't suffer any grievances.
Twenty minutes later, Ian cornered Leo in the break room.
"What the hell do you think you're doing?"
Leo's expression remained cheerful. "Helping my dearest friend find happiness, even if it means I have to suffer extreme violence in the process."
"You're going to suffer more than violence if you don't fix this."
"Think about it rationally," Leo said, switching to a more diplomatic tone. "An event like this is going to be overwhelming for Jay. Having you in his corner will actually make it easier for him. You'll be protecting him from discomfort."
"I'll be crossing every line."
"Imagine if Jay got paired with Max and had to listen to his crass comments half the night. Or ended up with some stranger from accounting."
Ian's anger faltered slightly. The thought of Jay feeling vulnerable or out of place at the retreat was distressing.
"You're manipulating me," Ian said.
"Absolutely. But I'm not wrong about Jay needing someone safe in his corner. And whether you want to admit it or not, you're the person he trusts most."
Ian stared at his friend, recognizing the truth in Leo's words despite his frustration. Jay had looked hurt when he'd protested the arrangement, as if Ian's objection had been personal.
"Three days, Leo. Three days of temptation I've been carefully avoiding."
"Three days of making sure one of your employees feels supported and comfortable. That's what good managers do."
Ian's resistance crumbled under the weight of his own protective instincts. "I'm going to make your life miserable for this."
"I'm counting on it," Leo said with a grin. "But you'll thank me eventually."
Ian doubted that, but as he returned to his office, he couldn't deny that the prospect of spending three days ensuring Jay's comfort felt less like a burden and more like a privilege he didn't deserve. The retreat was still weeks away, but already it loomed as a test of every defence Ian had built against his growing feelings.
Jay, meanwhile, returned to his work with cautious optimism. Whatever his initial anxiety about the arrangement, he trusted Ian more than anyone else at the company. If he had to manage three days of splendour and team-building activities, there was no one he'd rather have watching his back.
Scene 3
Spring has sprung
As April went on, spring came into full bloom. The city shed its winter coat, revealing patches of green that emerged from every crack and corner. Jay felt his energy returning with the season, and he tackled the backlog of life that had accumulated during his illness and the intense work period.
He set aside an older suit to keep at work—still presentable, if not as refined as his current rotation. It was the perfect choice for emergencies. He slipped it into a garment bag and brought it to the office, hanging it discreetly in the small coat closet near his desk. Better to be prepared than caught off guard again.
The rain-soaked suit had been rescued from the dry cleaners the week before, returned to its former condition without any trace of its ordeal. Jay examined it, running his fingers along the fabric. The relief was disproportionate to the cost of replacement, but he couldn't shake his ingrained frugality despite the increase in his bank account.
The lavish boutique outfit hung in his closet like a monument to poor decision-making. Every time he saw it, he winced at the memory of spending thousands on clothes he never wanted to buy. 
The begging of the month had brought a sizable quarterly bonus, pushing his financial situation into a comfortable territory. Yet the emergency shopping spree still rankled. He'd grown up counting every penny, and old habits died hard.
His apartment needed better preparation for future crises. The medicine cabinet overflowed with Ian's care package, but he'd been caught unprepared in other ways. He spent an afternoon organizing supplies: shelf-stable canned soups, crispbread, bottled water, ice packs, wet wipes, tissues. Everything placed strategically wherever his studio permitted.
The gym membership had been on his mental to-do list for months. He'd been thinking about Ian's obvious fitness, his perfect posture. Jay's own physical condition was embarrassing by comparison. 
He'd researched options in his neighborhood months ago but never followed through.  He opted for a modest facility in a nondescript building near his apartment. Their website promised beginner-friendly programs—exactly what he needed.
Turner & Associates provided memberships to upscale fitness centers in the financial district, but the thought of running into colleagues while sweating through a workout made him uncomfortable. This place felt manageable.
The gym occupied the ground floor, with painted concrete floors and equipment that looked worn but was well-maintained. The front desk clerk, a woman in her fifties, handed him a clipboard. "First time?"
"Yes. I saw you have a beginner program?"
"Absolutely. Rus will be your trainer today. He's great with people who are just starting out."
Rus turned out to be younger than Jay expected, with a patient demeanour. He was neither intimidatingly muscular nor dismissively casual—just encouraging.
"What are your goals?" Rus asked as they walked through the gym floor.
"I'm completely out of shape. I got sick recently and realized I need to take better care of myself."
"Good motivation. We'll start easy and build from there."
The first ten minutes on the treadmill were humbling. Jay's breathing became labored faster than he'd expected, and sweat soaked through his new gym shirt before he'd even broken into a proper jog. Rus noticed his struggle and guided him to a rowing machine.
"This is better for building endurance without impact. Try it for five minutes."
The rowing was easier on his lungs but brutal on muscles he'd forgotten he had. By the end of the hour, Jay felt simultaneously exhausted and energized. His legs shook as he walked to the locker room.
"How do you feel?" Rus asked as Jay gathered his things.
"Like I haven't moved my body in years."
"That's normal. Try to come back twice a week. Build the habit first. Intensity comes later."
Jay walked home slowly, but the soreness was not entirely unpleasant, giving him a sense of finally taking action instead of just thinking about it.
His phone rang that afternoon while he was cooking dinner. His mother's name appeared on the screen, and he answered with the slight wariness that family conversations always brought.
"Jay, sweetheart, how are you?"
"I'm good, Mom."
"Good, good. I'm so glad. Listen, I wanted to talk to you about something exciting. Ema's graduating from middle school this year."
Jay waited for more information, unsure why this required a phone call. His half-sister was fifteen, which made middle school graduation fairly predictable.
"She's been working so hard on this cheerleading act for the ceremony," his mother continued. "The whole squad is performing, and it's really important to her. She's been practicing for months."
The request was coming. Jay could hear it building in his mother's phrasing.
"The graduation is at the end of June, and we're making it a real family celebration. Your aunt and uncle are coming, and even your cousin Min. It's been so long since we've all been together."
Jay's stomach tightened. He hadn't been back to his hometown in over a year, not since the awkward Christmas visit before last. The idea of handling family dynamics felt exhausting.
"Ema specifically asked if you were coming," his mother continued. "She says you're the only one who never treats her like a little kid."
That was news to Jay. His interactions with Ema had been minimal and mostly centered around polite small talk during holiday visits. Maybe the Christmas present he’d sent had an impact.
"I'll have to check my schedule. Work's been really busy lately."
"Of course, honey. I know your job is important. But it would mean so much to her—to all of us—if you could make it. We hardly ever see you anymore."
The guilt came wrapped in affection, voiced with concern that made it impossible to ignore. His mother had a gift for that—never demanding, never harsh, just earnest enough to make refusal feel ungrateful. While Jay loved her, unease stirred beneath the warmth. Going home always felt a little like stepping into someone else’s life.
"I'll try, Mom. I really will. But I can't promise anything right now."
"That's all I ask. Just think about it, okay? It's been too long since you've been home."
After the call ended, Jay sat in his apartment, dinner preparations forgotten. Home. The word felt strange, disconnected from the small town where he'd grown up feeling like an outsider. His mother's house, filled with his step-father's family photos and his half-siblings' achievements, had never quite felt like his place.
He pushed the decision aside for now. The company retreat loomed in his immediate future, and that felt like enough stress to handle at the moment. June was still months away. By then, maybe he'd have a better sense of whether he could face going back to where he'd started.
Scene 4
Confidence
The night of the quarterly gathering crept up quickly, and Jay set about getting dressed without the apprehension he once felt. The navy suit felt like an old friend when Jay pulled it from his closet. The same outfit that had made him feel like a fraud at his first quarterly party now seemed perfect—elegant but conservative, well-fitted without being flashy. He selected a tie with subtle burgundy stripes, bolder than his normal choices but not enough to make him feel exposed.
The evening ahead didn't trigger the anxiety that had plagued him before. He understood these events and knew what to expect now. 
The venue was an upscale hotel, as always. Jay walked through the entrance without the awkward scanning he'd done at his first company event. He didn't need to search for familiar faces or worry about standing alone looking lost. He headed straight for the buffet, knowing exactly what he wanted. Experience had taught him that Max would materialize near the food within minutes of his own arrival, drawn by an infallible instinct for quality catering.
He was working on his second helping of an outstanding meat pie when Max appeared with Ela and Kim in tow.
"Started without us, I see," Max said, loading his plate with generous portions.
"The lamb is great," Jay replied, cutting another piece. "I wasn't about to let it get cold."
Kim sampled something that might have been duck confit. "They really outdid themselves this time. Last quarter's spread was great, but this restaurant is spectacular."
"The wine selection is impressive too," Ela added, returning from the bar with a glass of something that caught the light like liquid amber.
The conversation flowed around food and ambiance, comfortable topics that required no performance. Jay was relaxed, which would have been impossible months ago.
The rest of the team filtered in gradually. Jay tried the colorful cocktails without worrying about maintaining perfect composure, sampled appetizers without calculating whether he looked appropriately sophisticated doing so.
When Ian appeared, he moved through the room with grace, exchanging pleasantries with each group. Jay watched him approach their circle without the sharp awareness that had once made every interaction feel like a test.
"Evening, everyone. I trust you're all enjoying the hospitality."
"The catering budget was well spent," Amy replied. "Though I suspect we'll be hearing about it in the next expense review."
“Worth every penny,” Ian remarked as he took a bite.
He included Jay in the brief conversation that followed, nothing more or less than he offered the others. Jay felt neither snubbed nor singled out, just part of the group. When Ian moved on to entertain the senior partners, Jay realized how foolish his previous anxiety had been.
The evening dispersed into smaller conversations, people drifting between groups as mood and interest dictated. Jay remained near the buffet, no longer self-conscious about his appetite.
Luc returned after a circuit of the room to find Jay working on a tropical pudding topped with crystallized ginger.
"Still eating?" Luc asked with amusement. "You've been at this for an hour."
"The food is superb," Jay replied without shame, taking another spoonful. "It deserves to be appreciated."
"You look more at ease than during previous events," Luc observed.
"After the trauma of the gala, a small company party feels almost like home. I recognize nearly everyone in the room now. Maybe not on speaking terms with all of them, but I know the faces."
"That's progress," Luc said. "Though I'm not sure your relationship with the dessert table qualifies as friendly anymore. It's more like devotion."
Jay laughed. "I prefer to think of it as mutual attraction."
Near the end of the event, Leo approached carefully, as if he was testing uncertain waters. They hadn't spoken privately since his visit to Jay's apartment months ago, when the conversation had ended with tension and unresolved feelings.
"Jay. Enjoying yourself?"
"The food is outstanding. The company is tolerable."
"I thought you'd forgiven me," Leo said, though his tone made it clear he’d expected this reaction.
"I have. But I still don't trust you at all."
"Fair enough. I'm glad you made the best of the opportunity that was presented to you, regardless of what the underlying motives were."
"So am I. The opportunity turned out well. No thanks to your methods."
"Undoubtedly. But I'm still taking credit for the introduction."
Jay returned home that evening content. He'd survived the event without anxiety, without the desperate need to prove himself that had characterized his early months at Turner & Associates.
From across the room, Ian had watched Jay's confidence with relief. He remembered the deliberate coldness he'd shown at Jay's first quarterly party, the way he'd let his own emotional turmoil dictate his behavior. The memory made him feel ashamed.
Jay had looked lost that night, unsure of his place. Ian had recognized the vulnerability and responded by making it worse, using his own authority to reinforce Jay's sense of exclusion. He'd been shielding himself from feelings he didn't want to acknowledge, but Jay had paid the price for Ian's emotional confusion.
Tonight, Jay had needed no protection from the environment or the people in it. He'd moved through the evening freely, at ease with colleagues who had become friends. Watching him laugh at something Luc said, Ian felt Jay had found his place here. Ian had played a role in that success, but he'd also created unnecessary obstacles along the way.
Whatever complicated feelings Jay stirred in him, they were his burden to bear. Jay should never again be on the receiving end of Ian's struggles, never again made to feel unwelcome because of battles he hadn't chosen to fight.
The resolution sat heavy in Ian's chest as he made his final rounds of the evening, a promise to himself that felt both necessary and impossibly difficult to keep.
Scene 5
Coffee gesture
The quarterly party had come and gone, a pleasant enough evening, but unremarkable enough that Monday morning brought minimal discussion of who had attended and who had managed graceful early exits. 
April had delivered an unpleasant surprise from the weather gods. After a few days of spring warmth that had everyone shedding heavy coats and planning outdoor lunch destinations, the temperature had plummeted overnight, returning the city to winter's grip.
"I'm not going out in that," Luc declared, staring through the office windows at the gray sky that threatened rain or possibly snow. "Let's just order from the usual places."
"Agreed," Amy said.
Zoe also nodded. "I spent all morning looking forward to not having to wear my heavy coat anymore. I'm not changing my mind now."
But Kim was undeterred by the hostile weather. "There's a new place I want to try. Sweet and spicy with tropical influences. Could be interesting."
"Or terrible," Max grumbled, but he was already reaching for his coat. "But I suppose terrible food beats another day of noodles."
Jay became part of a smaller expedition—just the four of them braving the cold while half the team remained in the office's climate-controlled comfort. It felt different, like a specialized mission.
"Spicy with fruit," Kim read from his phone as they approached the restaurant. "The reviews are either raving or completely horrified. No middle ground." 
"That's a good sign," Max said dryly. "Nothing quite like polarizing opinions about food."
The restaurant was decorated with bright murals that seemed to mock the gray weather outside. The menu contained a bewildering array of dishes that combined flavors Jay would never have imagined together.
"Mango habanero chicken with coconut rice," Kim read enthusiastically. "Or pineapple curry beef with plantain chips."
"I'm getting a normal sandwich," Ela announced after scanning the options with obvious skepticism. "This is too experimental for a Monday."
Jay ordered something described as "glazed chicken with lychee and pickled dragonfruit," uncertain whether he was ordering lunch or volunteering for torture. The quarterly reports marathon had left him feeling more adventurous about small risks, as if surviving that ordeal had earned him permission to be slightly bolder in other areas.
Kim and Ela fell into animated conversation about flavor combinations and restaurant concepts. Max provided commentary that grew increasingly amused as their meal progressed.
"This is actually interesting," Jay admitted, surprised by how the unusual combinations somehow worked together.
Kim was delighted with his choices, while Ela remained unconvinced that experimental cuisine was an improvement over traditional seafood restaurants.
"It's fine for a one-time experience," she concluded, "but I'll stick with places that do one thing really well."
The walk back to the office reinforced Jay's gratitude for his expensive winter coat. The wind cut through the business district, making April feel more like February. His colleagues hunched into their outerwear while he remained comfortably insulated from the elements.
Halfway back, Jay noticed a new coffee shop that had opened recently in a space formerly occupied by a cellular phone store. The interior looked warm and inviting, with chalkboard menus advertising seasonal specials that seemed perfect for combating the unexpected chill.
"What if we brought coffee back for everyone? Something to help with team morale after this weather disappointment. I can use the company card."
Kim brightened immediately. "Good thinking."
Jay had been managing the department's discretionary expense account for months but had found few opportunities to use it for team benefits. Coffee seemed like an appropriate expenditure for boosting spirits during dreary weather.
Inside the coffee shop, they examined the seasonal offerings with the same adventurous spirit that had guided their lunch choices. Spring blend with lavender and honey. Cardamom spice latte with oat milk foam. Cherry blossom white chocolate mocha that seemed designed specifically for April's conflicted weather.
"Let's get everyone something different," Jay decided. "Make it an adventure for the whole team."
They placed orders for seven specialty drinks, each person receiving whatever struck the group as interesting or appropriate. Jay deliberated over Ian's selection longer than the others. Ian typically drank black coffee from a specific blend. Consistent, no surprises.
But Jay felt reckless. He ordered Ian a maple bourbon latte with cinnamon, knowing it was nothing like his preferences but hoping the gesture would outweigh any reservations.
The walk back to the office involved some coordination to prevent spills while avoiding wind that seemed determined to test their balance. They entered the building with the triumphant air of explorers returning from successful expedition.
"Coffee delivery service," Kim announced to the office at large, distributing the various drinks while explaining their selections.
Jay approached Ian's office with the maple bourbon latte, suddenly uncertain about his impulsive choice. Ian looked up from his computer with mild curiosity as Jay placed the cup on his desk.
"What's this?"
"Seasonal coffee from the new place down the street. Thought it might help with team morale given the weather."
Ian's expression was complicated—surprise mixed with something that might have been amusement or concern. "You didn't have to do that."
"I know. But everyone seemed to need something to lift their spirits."
Ian lifted the cup and took a sip, his face registering the unexpected flavors with diplomatic neutrality. "It's... interesting."
"You don't have to drink it if you don't like it. I know it's not your usual style."
"No, it's fine." Ian took another sip, seeming to consider the taste more thoughtfully. "Actually, it's quite good. Different, but good."
Jay felt relieved. "The company card has been sitting unused for months. Seemed like a good opportunity."
After Jay returned to his desk, Ian continued sipping the unfamiliar coffee. The maple sweetness was foreign to his palate, more dessert than beverage, but the gesture made it oddly enjoyable.
Jay had felt confident enough to make an independent decision about team morale, comfortable enough to use discretionary funds without seeking approval first. The coffee was evidence that Jay felt at home at Turner & Associates, that he saw himself as someone with agency to improve his colleagues' day.
The sweetness of the drink reminded Ian uncomfortably of Jay himself—kindness offered without calculation or expectation of reward. It was rare to encounter such generosity in their industry, where most gestures had hidden motives or strategic considerations.
Ian finished the entire cup despite his preference for savoury flavors, reluctant to waste something Jay had chosen specifically for him. The gesture had been small, but this thoughtfulness made long workdays more bearable.
He would have to be careful not to read too much significance into this, Ian reminded himself. It was a good development for Jay. Nothing more than that.
Chapter 15: Inferiority
Scene 1
Industry reading
The cold snap persisted throughout the week, generating daily debates about lunch destinations that had evolved from frustrated complaints into good-natured banter. The team's disposition had improved markedly since the brutal winter months—even when the weather disappointed, conversations held undertones of amusement.
"I'm staging a protest," Luc announced Wednesday morning, staring out the windows at yet another gray sky. "This is supposed to be spring. Where are the flowers? Where is the warmth? I demand answers from the meteorological authorities."
"File a complaint with nature. I'm sure they'll get right back to you," Kim said.
"At least it's getting warmer each day," Amy pointed out. "Yesterday was definitely less miserable than Monday."
She was right. Despite the continued overcast skies, the temperature had been climbing, making the walks to restaurants more tolerable even if they remained unpleasant. The promise of spring weather felt tantalizingly close.
The lunch expeditions varied in composition throughout the week. Some days half the team ventured out while others remained behind for delivery orders. Other days, everyone braved the weather with good-natured grumbling about April's fickleness.
But each day brought subtle improvement—a degree or two warmer, slightly less wind, occasional glimpses of sun that promised better weather ahead. By Thursday, even Luc had stopped lamenting the cold, though he continued to wear his winter coat with pointed emphasis on his suffering.
The approaching Easter weekend dominated conversation as the afternoon arrived. Four days off stretched ahead like a gift, the first extended break since the Christmas holidays.
"Family dinner at my parents' place," Max explained during their afternoon coffee break. "My mother has been planning the menu since February. She treats Easter like a culinary competition."
"Sounds lovely," Amy said. "We're driving to my aunt's farm. Fresh air, home cooking, absolutely no internet connection."
"I'm jealous," Zoe admitted. "I might hang out with some friends, but nothing definite. Probably just catch up on sleep and maybe see some movies."
"What about you, Luc?" Kim asked.
Luc's expression darkened comically. "Spending the weekend with my girlfriend's family. Three days of being interrogated about my career prospects and long-term intentions. I may not survive."
"It can't be that bad," Jay said.
"You don't know her father. He views every conversation as a job interview." Luc slumped in his chair dramatically. "I'd rather work through the holiday."
"No, you wouldn't. Nobody would rather work through Easter." Kim corrected.
"Fair point. But the family visit is still going to be torturous."
The group turned to Jay expectantly. "What about you? Any plans?"
"Nothing special. Rest, relaxation, maybe catch up on some industry reading I've been meaning to finish."
The reaction was immediate and unanimous.
"Industry reading? During a holiday weekend?" Max exclaimed.
"Jay, you're supposed to be resting. No work thoughts, no business materials, nothing related to Turner & Associates," Amy said.
Ela chimed in with equally dramatic warning. "You'll turn into Ian if you're not careful. He probably has financial statements bookmarked as leisure reading."
Jay laughed at their collective horror. "It's not really work reading. The industry publications  are interesting. Market analysis, regulatory developments, case studies of successful investment strategies—it's fascinating material."
"That's what Ian would say. Next you'll be telling us you enjoy reviewing compliance manuals for fun."  Luc observed darkly. 
"I don't enjoy compliance manuals. But understanding how markets function, learning about different investment approaches, reading about economic trends—that's actually engaging. It helps me understand the context of what we do here."
Kim shook his head in mock despair. "He's lost to us. Another casualty of corporate ambition."
"I'm not ambitious in that way. I just find it interesting to learn about the industry. It's not about getting ahead, it's about understanding."
"Promise us you'll do something purely recreational. Watch terrible television, read a novel, take long baths. Something completely unrelated to finance." Amy insisted. 
"I'll probably visit the library near my apartment. They have a good fiction section."
This seemed to satisfy his colleagues somewhat, though they continued to tease him about his idea of holiday relaxation. Jay didn't mind the gentle mockery—it felt affectionate, evidence of how comfortable he had become with the team.
By five, the office had begun its exodus for the long weekend. Jay remained at his desk longer than the others, organizing files and clearing his inbox for Tuesday's return. The administrative tasks that accumulated during busy periods required attention, and he preferred returning from breaks to clean systems without backlogs.
By five-forty-five, the office was nearly empty except for the cleaning staff. Jay gathered his things and prepared to leave, looking forward to four days without alarms or deadlines. But as he looked towards Ian's office, he could see him still absorbed in his tasks, surrounded by papers that indicated hours of additional work ahead. Ian showed no signs of preparing to leave, no indication that he recognized the approaching holiday weekend.
Jay paused in the hallway, wanting to say something but uncertain what words would be appropriate. He could suggest that Ian take the evening off, but that felt presumptuous. He could ask if Ian needed assistance, but that would obligate Jay to stay when he had already completed his own responsibilities. Instead, Jay approached Ian's doorway and knocked gently on the frame.
Ian looked up with mild surprise, as if he had forgotten other people existed in the building.
"I'm heading out. Just wanted to wish you a good spring break."
"Thank you. Enjoy your time off."
"Are you planning to leave soon?"
Ian glanced at the papers scattered across his desk. "I have a few things to finish up first."
Jay suspected that "a few things" actually meant several hours of complex tasks. The same deflection Ian employed whenever anyone said he might be working too much.
"Well, don't stay too late," Jay said, knowing the words were pointless but feeling compelled to say them anyway.
"I won't. Have a good weekend, Jay."
Jay left the office with Ian's response echoing in his mind, looking back as he headed for the elevator. Through the glass walls, he could see Ian already reabsorbed in his work, the papers and computer screen commanding his complete attention.
The sight made Jay feel something unfamiliar—less like admiration for Ian’s dedication and more like sadness. Everyone else was heading home to family dinners, countryside retreats, or simple relaxation. Ian remained alone in an empty office, choosing work over whatever personal life he might have waiting elsewhere.
As the elevator took Jay toward the lobby and the weekend beyond, he hoped that Ian would eventually recognize the value of rest and companionship. But he suspected that hope was probably futile.
Scene 2
Easter
Jay spent Easter weekend exactly as he had planned—alone in his apartment with a stack of economics texts spread across his dining table. While his colleagues enjoyed family gatherings and countryside retreats, he immersed himself in monetary policy analysis and emerging market trends.
The decision wasn't born from fascination with macroeconomic theory, though he had grown to appreciate the subject's complexity. It stemmed from a persistent anxiety about his credentials that no amount of workplace success seemed to alleviate.
His economics degree from a local university had none of the prestige that seemed to follow his colleagues. Just a middling education from a third-tier institution that had been affordable.
Jay had never heard anyone at Turner & Associates make disparaging comments about his academic background. Ian treated him with consistent respect, his colleagues included him in discussions without condescension, and his work was valued regardless of where he had learned to perform it. But the knowledge of his inferior credentials gnawed at him regardless.
Leo's original hiring rationale—that Jay was attractive enough to serve as decoration while performing basic administrative tasks—had wounded him precisely because it highlighted what he already suspected. He would never have secured such a prestigious position based purely on qualifications. The bitter truth was that his looks had opened a door that merit alone would have kept firmly closed.
The economics textbooks represented his attempt to bridge that gap through self-directed learning. He had recently ordered them online, deliberately choosing volumes more advanced than the ones he had kept from his college days, that spoke more directly to the demands of his current position. If he couldn't change his educational pedigree, he could at least expand his knowledge base beyond what his modest degree had provided.
Friday and Saturday passed in concentrated study, interrupted only by meals and brief walks to prevent the eye strain that came from hours of reading. Jay worked through chapters on international finance, took notes on concepts that challenged his understanding, and flagged sections for future review.
Sunday morning brought his single concession to holiday tradition—a breakfast that echoed childhood Easter meals with his grandmother. Hard-boiled eggs prepared exactly as she used to make them, served with specialty ham and lamb that lent a festive touch to his simple kitchen.
The memory of those breakfasts was among the few pleasant recollections from his early years. His grandmother had been a stern woman, made bitter by the burden of raising her unwed teenage daughter and the illegitimate grandson who came with her. Love had been scarce in that household, but basic care was provided with grudging reliability.
Jay understood now that his grandmother had been overwhelmed by responsibilities she hadn't chosen. A woman in her fifties suddenly caring for a baby while supporting her own daughter through the consequences of poor decisions. What he remembered as coldness was more likely exhaustion.
But Easter breakfasts had been different. The holiday had softened his grandmother's severity, creating space for small kindnesses that made the meal feel special. Jay recreated that atmosphere as best he could in his adult kitchen, enjoying the memory despite the complicated emotions it brought.
His mother called during the afternoon, her voice holding the warmth that always made Jay feel guilty about their limited contact.
"How are you spending Easter, sweetheart?" she asked.
"Quietly. Reading, relaxing. How's your celebration?"
She updated him about the holidays and his half-siblings' school achievements. Ari was excelling in mathematics, Ema had joined the debate team, Tim was already considering college applications.
Jay felt happiness for his siblings, who would never experience the uncertainty that had defined his own childhood. They had a father who was present and engaged, a stable household where children were not accidental burdens.
"I'm glad they are doing well, Mom," Jay said, meaning it completely.
"Are you taking care of yourself? You work so hard."
"I'm fine, Mom. Really. The job is good, the people are nice. I'm exactly where I want to be."
It was true, mostly. After the call ended, Jay thought about the contrast between his siblings' secure upbringing and his own fractured early years. But he felt no resentment toward his mother or her husband, no bitterness about the different treatment. His mother had been barely eighteen when he was born, unprepared for the responsibilities that followed. She deserved the happiness she had found with his stepfather and the family they had built together.
Jay's circumstances were his own to manage. He had been dealt a particular hand—modest background, limited resources, questionable academic credentials—and it was up to him to play it as skilfully as possible.
He took a walk through his neighbourhood in the late afternoon, happy the weather was warm enough to make outdoor exercise pleasant. The streets were quiet, most people apparently occupied with family gatherings or social activities. Jay preferred the solitude, using the time to process the morning's reading while enjoying the physical movement.
Back in his apartment, he returned to the economics texts with renewed focus. On Monday he started the second, more challenging book—a dense analysis of global financial systems that required frequent breaks and repeated reading of complex passages. Jay made notes, flagged concepts for further research, and pushed through sections that tested his comprehension limits.
By evening, he had completed one book entirely and made some progress through the second. The weekend felt productive, a feat that purely recreational activities wouldn't have matched.
The irony wasn't lost on him—just days earlier, he had felt sad watching Ian work alone in the empty office, viewing such dedication as somehow tragic. Now Jay realized he had spent his own holiday in almost identical fashion, choosing development over social activities.
But he felt no self-pity about the parallel. Quite the opposite—he felt fortunate beyond reasonable expectation. Tomorrow he would walk into Turner & Associates and collaborate with brilliant, accomplished people who treated him as an equal despite his inferior credentials. That opportunity was far more than someone with his background had any right to expect.
The least he could do was work continuously to deserve it. If self-directed education during holidays was the price of maintaining his position among people who belonged in that environment, it seemed like a bargain worth accepting.
Scene 3
Return to normalcy
The morning air was warm as Jay walked toward Northlight Financial Center at seven-twenty. He had shed his winter coat permanently, trading it for a light jacket. The earlier sunrise made the city feel more alive.
Turner & Associates' floor was empty when he arrived. Jay sat at his workstation and powered up his computer, scanning through emails that had accumulated over the holiday weekend. Nothing urgent waited for his attention—a comfort that would have been impossible during the brutal first quarter.
Ian arrived precisely at eight, looking more refreshed than he had in months.
"Good morning, Jay. How was your Easter?"
"Productive, thanks. How was yours?"
"Much the same. I managed to avoid checking emails for almost twenty-four hours. Consider it a personal victory."
Jay smiled. "That does sound like progress. At least you weren't here at six this morning."
"The early starts were getting ridiculous, even by my standards." Ian moved toward his office, then paused. "Did you do anything special for the holiday?"
"Read some economics texts, made myself a proper breakfast. Nothing elaborate." Jay kept his voice casual, not wanting to emphasize how solitary his weekend had been.
"Sounds perfectly reasonable. Better than the alternative of forced family gatherings."
Jay didn't press. He had learned to appreciate these brief moments of conversation without trying to extend them beyond their natural course.
By eight-thirty, the office filled with returning colleagues. Luc arrived looking distinctly less cheerful than normal, dropping into his chair with an audible sigh.
"Rough weekend?" Jay called from across the room.
"Girlfriend's family reunion. Her uncle monopolized every conversation with political rants, her grandmother criticized my table manners, and her cousin's children treated the place like a playground."
Amy emerged from the elevator wearing an expression of mild exasperation. "At least you had indoor plumbing. My daughters spent the entire weekend complaining about the lack of internet access at the cottage. Apparently, disconnecting from social media for three days constitutes cruel and unusual punishment."
"How old are they again?" Zoe asked.
"Fifteen and thirteen. Prime drama queen ages. They acted like I was punishing them personally by choosing a spot without reliable WiFi."
Max appeared cheerful, though he patted his midsection ruefully. "My mother outdid herself this year. Ham, roast, three different lamb dishes, and enough dessert to feed a small army. I may need to spend the next month living on salads."
Zoe pulled out her phone and scrolled through photos. "I went hiking with some university friends. We found this amazing trail system about two hours north of the city. The wildflowers are already blooming, and the views were incredible."
She showed the screen to anyone within range, displaying pictures of rolling hills dotted with early spring colours.
Kim and Ela arrived together, exchanging what could only be described as conspiratorial glances. When Max asked about their weekend, they both became unusually evasive.
"Oh, you know. Relaxing. Nothing special," Ela said, avoiding eye contact.
"Very relaxing," Kim agreed, then caught Ela's expression and stifled what sounded suspiciously like a laugh.
The exchange didn't go unnoticed by the rest of the team, but nobody pressed for details.
"What about you, Jay?" Amy asked. "Please tell me you did something more interesting than studying."
Jay hesitated, knowing his answer would provoke exactly the reaction he wanted to avoid. "I spent most of the weekend reading. Picked up some economics textbooks I'd been meaning to get through."
The response was immediate and unanimous.
"Jay, no," Luc groaned.
"Please tell me you're joking," Amy said.
"Economics textbooks? During a holiday weekend?" Max shook his head. 
Jay felt heat rise in his cheeks but tried to keep his tone light. "I enjoyed it, actually. Besides, it's useful knowledge for this job."
"You already do excellent work," Max said. "You don't need to study during your time off."
The conversation moved on to other topics, but Jay caught several concerned glances directed his way throughout the morning. He appreciated their worry, even if he couldn't explain why the weekend had felt exactly right to him.
The office resumed its previous pace. Projects moved forward without the frantic urgency that had characterized the first quarter. When noon arrived, the team gathered near the elevators to decide on their destination.
"Where are we going?" Max asked.
"Ela's been talking about that seafood place," Amy said.
Ela's face lit up. "The one with the incredible crab cakes? Yes! I've been craving them for weeks."
The suggestion met with general approval, and the group headed out into the warm afternoon air. Jay walked beside Kim, who was still exchanging secretive smiles with Ela.
The seafood restaurant was an excellent choice. The spring weather made outdoor seating comfortable, and the relaxed atmosphere encouraged conversation. Jay listened to his colleagues discuss work projects and the general improvements in everyone's mood now that the intense workload had eased.
He realized how much he had grown to value these moments. Six months ago, he would have been terrified of these gatherings, worried about saying the wrong thing or revealing his inadequacy. Now he contributed naturally to conversations.
The afternoon passed smoothly, with everyone handling their respective assignments at a sustainable pace. When five o'clock arrived, most of the team began packing. Jay, however, remained at his desk, pulling up formatting templates for reports that Ian would need the following day.
The office gradually emptied until only Jay and Ian remained. The workload didn't truly justify staying late, but the idea of Ian working alone evening after evening continued to bother Jay. He couldn't articulate why the image of his boss maintaining solitary vigil in the empty office seemed so troubling, but the feeling persisted.
He tackled minor tasks that had accumulated during the busy period. These could wait until later, but doing them now meant fewer distractions during regular hours.
Jay arranged his workstation thoughtfully, thinking how it might look to someone observing the space. His colleagues had personalized their areas with pictures, small decorative items, books. Zoe kept a small succulent plant, Kim displayed an action figure from some science fiction series, and Max had framed photographs of his family.
Jay's desk remained notably bare by comparison. He decided to bring one of the economics textbooks tomorrow—specifically the one he had finished over the weekend but found useful enough to keep as a reference. Perhaps some magazines as well, for the slower periods that might eventually arrive.
At eight o'clock, Ian emerged from his office carrying his briefcase and jacket.
"Ready to head out?" he asked.
Jay saved his work and gathered his belongings. They walked to the elevators together, the building now mostly empty except for security staff and cleaning crews.
"Thank you for staying late," Ian said as they waited for the elevator. "The extra preparation time helps with tomorrow's schedule."
"It's no trouble. Besides, the workload is finally manageable enough to catch up on things."
The elevator arrived, and they stepped inside. Jay pressed the lobby button while Ian selected the garage level.
"The pace is definitely more reasonable now. I appreciate everyone's patience during the difficult months."
"Everyone understands. Results like ours don't come without some sacrifice."
The elevator stopped at the lobby level, and Jay stepped out.
"Have a good evening," Ian said.
"You too."
The lobby doors closed, and Jay walked out into the spring air. The temperature had dropped enough to make his light jacket useful, but the evening remained pleasant as he walked toward the metro station.
The spring break had helped put the ordeal of the first quarter behind them. Jay felt a calm he wouldn’t have believed possible just weeks earlier, when every day brought new crises and impossible deadlines. The desperation of the winter months had finally lifted, leaving space for regular work that Jay had always preferred.
Scene 4
Comfortable warmth
The weather turned pleasant as April progressed, warm enough for lunch outings to consistently happen without the constant complaints about the cold. Jay seized every opportunity to steer the group toward Willow & Sage, which had become his personal mission to explore completely.
"Their spring menu is great," he mentioned during Tuesday's morning coffee break.
"Not the bistro again," Kim groaned.
"The tomato basil soup is amazing. And I'm working through their entire soup menu systematically,"  Jay replied, unrepentant.
"How many varieties do they have?" Amy asked.
"Fourteen rotating options. I've tried eight so far."
He no longer flinched at spending so much money on lunch, his budget comfortably accommodating what had once felt like extravagance. The bistro's rotating soup menu had become his personal challenge—he was determined to sample every variety they provided.
The lunch crowd no longer required complex negotiations about time and location. Jay was at the centre of these casual arrangements, his enthusiasm for the bistro powerful enough to overcome any reluctance about the prices.
At Willow & Sage, he worked his way through a bowl of roasted fennel bisque while listening to Ela's gossip. The spring air drifted through open windows, bringing the scent of flowering trees from the nearby park. He couldn't remember the last time he'd felt this consistently content.
The workload had returned to manageable levels. The team rarely stayed past six anymore, the crisis-driven overtime becoming an exception. Ian still stayed late most nights, a habit that seemed ingrained regardless of actual necessity.
Jay occasionally remained when his own work warranted it—maybe once or twice a week, when documents required an urgent review. During these late evenings, it was mostly just the two of them in the office, working diligently side by side. Conversation, when it happened, was minimal and strictly confined to the task at hand. 
Even after all these months, Ian remained reserved, and Jay had learned not to expect more. They established a comfortable, if dull, pace. Ian didn't discouraged these stays. He was secretly elated by Jay's soothing company that brought some joy to those otherwise solitary hours.
The Friday drinks tradition had resumed with the return of reasonable schedules. Jay's refusal had become expected, meeting Luc's good-natured persistence with dry humour.
"Come on, Jay. Tomorrow's supposed to be beautiful. We could even sit outside at Murphy's."
"I'm sure the weather will be just as beautiful from my apartment window."
"You're missing out on valuable team bonding," Luc insisted.
"I'm bonding with this grilled vegetable panini right now. It's very fulfilling."
That afternoon, instead of heading straight home, Jay took a detour to the small park he'd discovered during his first weeks at Turner & Associates. He'd never returned since that initial exploration, too caught up in the anxiety of fitting in to spare time for simple pleasures.
The spring bloom had made the space more charming. Trees displayed clouds of pink and white blossoms, and flower beds showed the first bright colours of the season. The park felt more tranquil than he remembered, insulated from the city's noise by landscaping and the gentle murmur of a small fountain.
An artisanal ice cream truck had parked near the main path, with hand-painted menu board advertising flavours Jay had never heard of. He ordered something called sea buckthorn with honey and cream, curiosity overcoming caution with unfamiliar foods.
The bench where he sat faced west, catching the afternoon sun through the new leaves. Jay ate slowly, savouring the unexpected combination of flavours while watching office workers cut through the park on their way to metro stations and bus stops.
The contentment was unfamiliar, this desire to sit and simply exist without purpose or agenda. He'd never been someone who sought out moments of leisure, too accustomed to the anxiety that made stillness feel like wasted time. But here, with the sun warm on his face and the strange, delicious ice cream melting on his tongue, he felt at peace.
The lack of anxiety was still new enough to notice, like the absence of a headache that had been ignored until it disappeared. He thought about joining the team for drinks next Friday, imagining their surprise when he actually showed up. The idea made him smile.
Tuesday afternoons had become gym days, scheduled around Rus's availability. The trainer turned out to be a pleasant, easygoing man in his thirties who managed Jay's pace expertly, clearly accustomed to guiding beginners.
"Let's add five minutes to the treadmill today," Rus said during Jay's third week of regular attendance. "You've been building good endurance."
Jay could manage the treadmill with less difficulty than before, breathing steadily even as the minutes passed.
"How are you feeling?" Rus asked after twenty-five minutes.
"Less like I'm going to die," Jay admitted, stepping down from the treadmill  "Though still moderately terrible."
"That's progress. Your stamina is definitely improving."
Jay nodded, the five additional minutes feeling like a step forward.
"I've put together a simple set of exercises you can do at home," Rus continued, handing Jay a printed sheet. "Nothing that requires equipment or much space. It should help with overall conditioning."
The plan looked manageable: stretching, squats, pushups, and basic core work. Jay grudgingly committed to fifteen minutes every other day, fitting it into his morning, though he suspected his enthusiasm for home exercise would be limited.
The gym felt less intimidating than he'd feared. The other members were focused on their own workouts, paying no attention to his efforts. Jay took pride in the visible improvements—he could spend longer on the treadmill now before running out of breath, manage more pushups before his arms gave out. It was enough to maintain his motivation.
In the evenings, he'd taken to reading management books, studying team dynamics and effective leadership, on top of the economics literature he was already working through. The theoretical frameworks helped him understand the mechanisms behind Ian's seemingly effortless authority.
Every chapter reinforced his admiration for Ian's approach. What had appeared straightforward from the outside revealed itself as complex orchestration, requiring constant attention to individual personalities, group dynamics, and organizational pressures. Ian made it look easy, but the books made clear how much skill and experience went into that appearance of ease.
Jay closed the volume and set it aside, looking out at the city lights through his apartment window. The spring evening was warm enough to leave the windows open, bringing the sounds of traffic into his quiet space. Jay was content to savour this season of unexpected peace.
Scene 5
Intrusion
Ian watched from his office doorway as Jay gathered his belongings at precisely five o'clock, the same pattern he had observed for the past several weeks. Every Tuesday without fail, Jay departed at closing time while other days he might stay late to tackle additional work.
Despite months of demonstrated reliability and competence, despite Jay's obvious dedication and honest character, Ian still paid him far more attention than necessity warranted. Not from suspicion anymore, but from fascination.
"Goodbye, Ian," Jay said as he was leaving.
"Have a good evening," Ian replied.
The office emptied gradually as the rest of the team left as well. Ian remained, reviewing performance reports. By six-thirty, the floor had fallen quiet. Ian emerged from his office, needing to retrieve files from the main storage area. But instead, he paused beside Jay's workstation, examining the small changes that had accumulated over recent weeks.
The space no longer maintained its original sterile state. Jay had added subtle personal touches that spoke to growing comfort with his environment. A spare suit hung in the small closet—a sensible precaution after the winter storm incident that had forced him to purchase emergency clothing. The desk drawers now contained basic medical supplies, evidence he had learned to prepare for unexpected circumstances.
Two items particularly caught Ian's attention: an economics textbook and several current issues of financial journals. The book was a respected academic text that Ian recognized from his own university years—intermediate level material that covered monetary policy, international finance, and market dynamics relevant to their daily work.
Ian picked up the textbook and immediately noticed the abundance of small coloured tabs protruding from its pages. Jay had marked passages extensively, creating a reference system. The sight triggered a memory of similar study habits from his own academic years, when textbooks became personal guides.
Ian knew he was crossing a line, but curiosity overcame his better judgement, and he opened the book to a random page. Jay's handwriting filled the margins—the same beautiful script that appeared on document annotations and project notes throughout their shared work. It created an unexpected sense of intimacy, as if Ian were reading private correspondence.
The notes revealed a structured approach to learning. Jay had not simply highlighted important passages but had engaged with the material, asking questions, drawing connections, and referencing additional sources. Comments like "check acquisition model—similar approach?" and "correlation with policy discussion from Monday's meeting" demonstrated that Jay was connecting theoretical concepts to their practical applications.
Ian sat on Jay's chair, drawn deeper into this accidental glimpse of how Jay's mind worked. The margins contained tiny revelations: moments where Jay had clearly struggled with complex concepts, breakthrough insights marked with enthusiastic exclamation points.
One dense section on international capital flows contained a series of increasingly confident notes. Jay had initially written "need to review this again—I don't get it," but subsequent annotations showed his growing understanding of the material. By the chapter's end, his notes had evolved into a detailed analysis.
The progression charmed him more than he cared to admit. Here was evidence of intellectual curiosity combined with effort—someone who refused to accept limitations imposed by his educational background and instead committed to continuous improvement.
Ian turned pages slowly, discovering more about Jay through his private academic conversations with himself. The young man emerged as someone who questioned assumptions, sought multiple perspectives, but at the same time remained humble. Comments like "am I understanding this correctly?" and "need to verify this interpretation" revealed someone more concerned with accuracy than appearing knowledgeable.
Some notes made Ian smile involuntarily. Jay had written "finally makes sense!" beside a complex explanation of derivative markets, and "why didn't they explain it this way initially?" after working through a challenging mathematical proof. The enthusiasm was endearing.
The journals contained similar annotations, though focused on current events. Jay had connected recent market movements to broader economic principles, noted discrepancies between different analysts' interpretations, and identified trends that related to their clients' investment strategies.
Ian had been reading for over an hour, completely absorbed in Jay's private educational journey. The invasion of privacy should have troubled him, but instead he felt a surge of affection he couldn't suppress.
These notes painted a picture of a person who approached learning with curiosity and without superficial ambition. The contrast with his own privileged educational background was stark—Ian had attended elite institutions, enjoyed access to the best tutors and materials.
Another lengthy note caught his attention: "The relationship between interest rate policy and employment figures is more complex than I originally understood. Need to reconsider some of my assumptions about decision-making. Maybe the delayed effects explain why Ian always seems to anticipate policy changes before they're announced?"
The mention of his own name made his heart skip a beat. Jay was trying to understand not just abstract economic principles, but the practical wisdom Ian applied in his daily decisions. It warmed him to know Jay’s thoughts had turned to him even in his private moments.
The building had grown completely quiet around him, the city lights beginning to dominate the view from the large windows. Ian closed the textbook, returning it to its exact position on Jay's desk. He remained in the chair for several more minutes, surrounded by the evidence of Jay's pursuit of knowledge.
Sitting in the empty office, Ian acknowledged what had been building for months despite his resistance. His attention to Jay's schedule, his awareness of Jay's reactions, his concern for Jay's well-being—none of it stemmed from obligation or suspicion.
It was becoming increasingly difficult to maintain the distance he had imposed between them, especially when every interaction revealed new reasons to be fond of the young man. Jay's dedication, modesty, consideration for others despite his own circumstances—all of it contributed to a growing attachment that Ian knew he should resist.
The feelings were dangerous and entirely inappropriate. Ian had learned that lesson the hard way, though he understood now that what he felt for Jay was fundamentally different from that earlier infatuation. Sam had been exciting—charming and magnetic, disarming Ian's caution. Jay was none of those things, but his warmth had somehow become essential. Whatever he felt for Jay, it had grown beyond his ability to rationalize it away.
Freefall
Chapter 16: Preparations
Scene 1
Client meeting
The morning sun streamed through Ian's office windows as he reviewed the final details for the Calder Wetherby Trust meeting. Outside, the city basked in a spring weather so perfect that it made even the most dedicated workaholic consider taking lunch outdoors.
"Jay, could I speak with you for a moment?" he called through his open office door.
Jay appeared within seconds. "Yes?"
"I have a meeting tomorrow with Calder Wetherby Trust. It's scheduled for one o'clock at their offices. I'd like you to accompany me."
Jay felt his stomach tighten. Client meetings represented territory he had barely explored during his time at the company. "What would you need me to do?"
"Take notes, primarily. Handle any documentation that comes up during the discussion. It's not complicated, but having someone there to track details allows me to focus on the conversation itself."
The request was reasonable—assistants accompanied executives to important meetings regularly. But Jay had grown comfortable with his behind-the-scenes roles. He rarely needed to participate in high-stakes client interactions.
"Is there anything specific I should prepare for?"
"Not particularly. Tomorrow's meeting is more relationship maintenance than active negotiation." Ian paused, seeming to consider Jay's obvious apprehension. "You'll do fine. Just bring your laptop and take notes on anything that seems important."
Jay nodded, already mentally reviewing his limited experience with client-facing responsibilities. The prospect made him nervous, but Ian's confidence was reassuring.
"We'll leave at noon to allow plenty of time. The meeting shouldn't run longer than an hour."
Ian rarely attended client meetings personally—that responsibility typically fell to Leo or the dedicated client relations team. Leo possessed the natural charm and social grace that made him perfectly suited for client schmoozing.
As CFO, Ian's role centred on internal operations and strategic oversight, and not the social management that such encounters required. But Ken Wetherby had specifically requested Ian, and when one of Turner & Associates' four largest clients made such requests, exceptions were made.
After Jay returned to his desk, Ian thought about the decision to include him. Officially, having an assistant present for note-taking was perfectly standard. Unofficially, Ian had grown accustomed to Jay's company and found the prospect of handling the meeting alone less appealing than it should have been.
The next morning brought cloudless skies and temperatures that made the walk to work pleasant. Jay arrived early, wearing what he considered his most formal suit—gray with a black tie. The combination was conservative to the point of severity, clearly chosen to project maximum professionalism. He took special care to ensure that every detail appeared flawless, from his precisely knotted tie to his polished shoes. The last thing he wanted was to embarrass Ian in front of such an important client.
At his desk, he spent extra time reviewing the Calder Wetherby file, but since it was one of the most important clients in their portfolio, he was already well-acquainted with their account history. 
At noon precisely, Ian appeared at his desk. "Ready?"
They descended to the garage level where Turner & Associates' company car waited. The driver held the rear door open as they got in. Jay had ridden in the company car before, but the vehicle still felt incongruous with his modest background. Leather seats and a partition separating them from the driver created an atmosphere of affluent privacy.
"The drive should take about thirty minutes. Traffic permitting," Ian said.
Jay watched the cityscape change as they moved from the financial district toward residential areas he had never visited. Glass towers and concrete gave way to tree-lined streets and architectural grandeur that belonged to a different era entirely. The buildings grew larger and more ornate, set back from the street by manicured lawns and elaborate landscaping. Even the sidewalks looked more expensive.
"I've never been to this part of the city," Jay admitted, unable to hide his fascination with the scenery.
"It's quite different from downtown. More space, obviously. Different pace of life."
The understatement was remarkable. Jay stared at mansion after mansion, each more impressive than the last. Wrought-iron gates, circular driveways, gardens that probably required entire teams for maintenance. The wealth on display was almost abstract in its magnitude.
Ian had grown up in this world and rarely thought about its impact on newcomers. Watching Jay's reaction reminded him of the first time he had brought Sam to similar areas, though Jay's response was more reticent than Sam's had been.
Where Sam had made jokes about excessive wealth and ostentatious display, Jay simply observed with appreciation for beauty. His wonder seemed untainted by resentment or cynicism. Ian looked away before Jay caught him staring. The comparison to Sam was unfair and unhelpful—Jay had never given him reason to doubt his sincerity. The awe in Jay’s expression was endearing, though Ian tried not to find it as charming as he did.
"We're making good time," Ian observed, glancing at his watch. He spoke to the driver through the intercom. "We have some extra time. Take us through Riverside Park  before heading to the office building."
The detour revealed a street lined with what could only be described as architectural masterpieces. Victorian mansions competed with modern estates, all surrounded by grounds that resembled public parks. Jay tried not to gawk, but the sight was spectacular.
One particular mansion caught his attention—a limestone structure with towers and bay windows that looked like something from a historical drama. The grounds included a golf course and a guest house larger than Jay's entire apartment building.
"Impressive," Jay said quietly.
Ian didn't comment, but Jay thought he detected the hint of a smile on his face.
The Calder Wetherby Trust occupied a building that seemed to have been transported from nineteen-century. Dark wood panelling, crystal chandeliers, and soft rugs created an atmosphere of established wealth that made Turner & Associates' modern style seem almost casual by comparison.
Jay's eyes widened slightly as they were escorted through the entrance hall, but he quickly composed himself and followed Ian's lead toward the executive offices.
Ken Wetherby greeted them in a reception area dominated by oil paintings of stern-looking men in formal attire. He was perhaps sixty, with silver hair and confident bearing that came from generations of inherited authority.
"Ian, excellent to see you," Ken said, extending his hand.
"Ken, thank you for accommodating our schedule. This is Jay Hall, my assistant."
The introduction was polite but perfunctory. Jay understood immediately that his role was to remain largely invisible while the important conversation took place.
They moved to Wetherby's office, where leather-bound books lined the walls and afternoon light filtered through leaded glass windows. Jay positioned himself at a small side table with his laptop while Ian and Wetherby sat on armchairs near a fireplace.
The meeting that followed was unlike anything Jay had expected. Instead of financial analysis or contract negotiations, the conversation meandered through topics that seemed almost social. Tennis, mutual acquaintances, a brief discussion about whiskey that led Wetherby to pour drinks despite the early afternoon hour.
Jay typed diligently, capturing what little business content emerged from the discussion. A  mention of "exploring opportunities in the emerging markets," and a casual comment about "moving forward with the infrastructure investment we discussed."
Each seemingly offhand remark involved sums that made Jay's head spin. Hundreds of millions addressed as casually as discussing weekend plans. When Ken mentioned expanding their portfolio by another two hundred millions, Jay's typing intensified slightly, but he showed no other reaction to figures that would have represented astronomical sums to most people.
After about one hour, Ian glanced at his watch and made polite excuses about not taking up more of Wetherby's time. The farewell was warm but brief, with promises to "do this again soon" and instructions to "give my regards to Leo."
"That was more politics than business," Ian explained as they walked back to the car. "But sometimes these relationship visits are more important than formal presentations. Wetherby likes to feel that his account receives personal attention from senior leadership."
Jay processed this information as they got back into the car. The meeting had been essentially a social call dressed up as business—an expensive way to maintain goodwill with a client who could afford to demand such treatment.

Scene 2
Tingling
"Since we're out during lunch hours, we might as well make the most of it. There's a restaurant nearby that's worth trying," Ian said.
"That sounds good."
The car delivered them to an establishment that epitomized the district's sophisticated atmosphere. The building was elegant, with the entrance marked by brass fixtures and flowering plants.
The server led them to a private dining room with views of a small garden courtyard. Jay felt the unease of being surrounded by extravagance beyond his reach, but Ian’s relaxed demeanour helped him ease into the experience.
"Order whatever appeals to you," Ian said, scanning the menu. "It's a business expense."
Jay appreciated the clarification because the prices were shocking. Despite the reassurance, he selected one of the more modest options while Ian selected items that made it clear he was treating the meal as an indulgence.
"I don't often deviate from my meal plan. But occasional exceptions are worth making," Ian admitted when the server left.
"I imagine your gym trainer wouldn't approve."
"What my trainer doesn't know won't hurt him."
The food, when it arrived, justified its cost. Jay's salmon was prepared with a complexity of flavours he had never experienced, while Ian's selections created a meal that seemed designed for savouring.
"The Wetherby family has been in this area for generations. Ken's grandfather established the trust in the 1920s. Old money, established connections, a client that values tradition over innovation."
Jay listened carefully, filing away information that might prove useful in future interactions. Ian rarely shared private background details about clients, and Jay was fascinated by the insights into the world they just witnessed.
"The Calder Wetherby Trust has been with us since Leo's father started the company. Ken inherited the relationship along with the fortune, but he's been remarkably hands-off about management decisions."
"Is that common with clients of that size?"
"Depends on the individual. Some want detailed reports and frequent updates. Others prefer to review annual summaries and leave the details to experts they trust."
Ian continued sharing background information about various clients and the different approaches required for each relationship, and Jay absorbed every detail.
"I grew up not far from here," Ian eventually said, indicating a tree-lined street visible in the distance.
The revelation didn't surprise Jay—he knew about Ian's affluent origins. But hearing it confirmed created a new understanding of the gulf between their backgrounds.
"It must have been incredible, growing up surrounded by all this." 
"It had its advantages," Ian said. The conversation was veering toward personal territory he usually avoided, but Jay's honest interest made the disclosure feel natural.
"I can't imagine having access to so much beauty and culture from childhood."
"Beauty doesn't necessarily translate to happiness."
The comment hinted at complexities Jay didn’t feel comfortable exploring, though it brought out a human side of Ian that their relationship seldom revealed.
"Where did you grow up?" Ian asked, though he already knew the basic details from Jay's employment file.
"Small town about four hours south. More farmland than culture, but it had its own appeal. Different kind of beauty."
"More freedom to roam without worrying about property lines."
The comment hinted at the constraints of Ian's privileged upbringing. Jay wanted to ask more questions but didn't dare push beyond what Ian volunteered.
"There was nice countryside nearby. I used to ride my bicycle to explore forests and follow the river, during the moments when I was allowed to."
Ian detected a slight defensiveness that hinted at complicated feelings about his origins. He didn't press for additional details. Instead, he continued describing the neighbourhood's history, pointing out architectural details that most visitors missed. 
Dessert appeared without Jay ordering it—Ian's suggestion that they share something described as "seasonal fruit with champagne reduction." The presentation was more art than food, and the taste was subtle enough to make Jay wonder if his palate was adequately developed to appreciate what he was experiencing.
"This has been really nice," Jay said, meaning it completely.
"I'm glad. You handled the meeting well."
The praise created warmth in Jay's chest that seemed disproportionate to the simple compliment. But Ian's approval meant more to him than he cared to examine too closely.
When they finally left the restaurant, the afternoon had advanced to past three o'clock. The leisurely meal had stretched far beyond Jay's expectations, creating an experience that felt personal despite the business context.
Traffic had thickened during their extended lunch, turning the return drive into a slow crawl through city streets. Jay stole glances when he thought Ian wasn't paying attention, struck by details he rarely allowed himself to observe. 
The cologne was particularly distracting—something that Jay had begun to associate with their morning conversations. In the car's narrow space, the scent seemed more noticeable, making his thoughts wander in directions he tried to avoid.
Sitting so close to Ian, watching the afternoon light play across his features, breathing in the scent of his cologne—it reminded him of those winter evenings when they had worked late together, surrounded by the festive glow of decorations, the dreamlike warmth creating a closeness that felt almost intimate.
Ian didn’t seem irritated by the delay, leaning back in his seat with the same ease he had shown all day. He looked out at the landscape sliding past, his thoughts elsewhere, the stillness sharpening the refined lines of his profile.
The traffic jam forced them into closer proximity than their usual interactions allowed. Ian could sense Jay's occasional glances, could see the slight flush in his cheeks. The younger man's fascination with the day's experiences, his transparent reactions,  his obvious efforts to appear collected despite his nervousness combined to create a portrait of earnest determination that Ian found almost irresistible. The atmosphere in the limousine felt charged, becoming increasingly difficult to dismiss.
When they finally arrived at Northlight Financial Center, Jay stepped out into the fresh May air and felt a flutter in his stomach. The afternoon had been unlike anything in his previous experience at Turner & Associates—formal yet somehow personal.
As they rode the elevator back to their floor, Jay realized the day had changed something in his understanding of his relationship with Ian. Not dramatically, but enough to leave him feeling slightly off-balance.
"Thank you for today," he said as they reached their floor.
"You're welcome. I hope it was informative."
Jay returned to his desk with the lingering awareness that the afternoon had been more than informative. It had been enjoyable, probably more than was entirely appropriate.
The day had shown him glimpses into Ian's world—both the privileged background that had shaped him and the personal qualities that made him such an exceptional leader. Those insights felt precious, not for advancing his career, but for deepening his understanding of the man he had grown to admire so deeply.
Jay gathered his belongings and prepared to leave for the day—it was already past normal closing time, and the extended lunch had disrupted his schedule.
"Have a good evening," he said, then headed toward the elevators.
Ian watched Jay leave, then sat behind his desk without immediately beginning any work. The afternoon had been unexpectedly pleasant, and that created complications he wasn't sure how to address.
He told himself it was nothing more than the charm of an unusual day, a pleasant deviation that would fade once normal schedules resumed. The attraction he felt toward Jay was manageable as long as he maintained distance.
But without suspicion to color his perceptions, Ian found Jay's earnest dedication almost impossibly endearing and increasingly difficult to resist. He sat alone in his office the whole evening, trying to convince himself that he could keep his heart on a leash despite mounting evidence to the contrary.
Scene 3
Disgusting beer
Jay had spent Friday in unusually high spirits, buoyed by the success of the previous day's client meeting and the growing confidence that came from nearly a year of achievements.
As the clock neared five, Luc appeared at Jay's desk with a resigned expression that had become part of their weekly ritual.
"Murphy's is doing happy hour for their craft beers tonight," Luc said with theatrical casualness. "You interested?"
"Sure," Jay said, not looking up from his computer screen.
The silence that followed was so complete that Jay finally raised his eyes. Luc stood frozen, mouth slightly open, as if he'd forgotten how to process unexpected information.
"I'm sorry, what did you say?"
"I said sure. Seven o'clock, right?"
"Are you serious?" Luc's voice cracked slightly on the last word.
"Completely. Though I reserve the right to leave if the beer is terrible."
The team had gathered near his desk on their way to the elevators, and Jay's casual acceptance drew surprised laughter from everyone within earshot. Amy raised an eyebrow, Ela looked delighted.
"About time you gave in to peer pressure. We were beginning to think you were morally opposed to fun." Max said.
Kim made a show of checking his phone calendar as if to mark the historic moment. "Did hell freeze over? Should we be worried about the apocalypse?"
From his office, Ian observed the scene through his open door. The sight of Jay's warm smile, his integration into the group that had once seemed so impossible, made Ian happy for an instant, but left behind a dull ache of wanting something he knew he shouldn’t.
"Have a good evening, Ian," Jay called out as he left.
"You too."
The team headed for the elevators and Ian was unable to focus back on the reports waiting on his desk. The office felt too quiet after the laughter that had echoed from Jay's corner. The thought of staying late felt unbearable, so he gathered his things and headed home, something he rarely did before seven.
His penthouse's gym provided the outlet he needed, and he pushed himself through an exhausting workout that left him too tired to think about Jay's smile or the way his colleagues had embraced him so completely.
Instead of commuting home and back, Jay decided to try a local restaurant he'd passed countless times but never entered. Dining alone had never held any appeal, but tonight it served its function well enough. The pasta was adequate and the experience satisfactory if not memorable.
Murphy's was already crowded when he arrived at seven, the happy hour crowd creating an animated atmosphere that usually made Jay want to retreat. But tonight, surrounded by familiar faces, the energy didn't feel as overwhelming. Max dominated the space with his booming voice and endless supply of stories, Amy provided dry commentary, and Kim and Ela continued their subtle flirtation that nobody acknowledged directly.
Jay ordered whatever Luc recommended and immediately regretted it. The craft beer was aggressively bitter, an assault on his palate that made him wince with each sip.
"This is awful," he announced, earning sympathetic laughter from the group.
"It's an acquired taste," Amy said diplomatically.
"I'm not sure I want to acquire it," Jay replied, though he continued drinking.
"So the retreat is coming up in two weeks. Has everyone figured out what they're wearing?" Zoe asked.
The comment triggered a general discussion about the upcoming event. Suddenly everyone was discussing preparations with the enthusiasm of people planning a military campaign.
"The weather forecast looks perfect. I packed three different swimsuits just in case." Amy said.
"I finally found the perfect evening dress. Midnight blue with just enough sparkle to catch the light without being overdone." Ela added.
Jay listened with growing awareness of his own lack of preparation. Swimming shorts, resort-appropriate clothing, luggage that didn't look like it belonged in a thrift store—he'd given none of it serious thought.
"What about you, Jay? Ready for three days of indulgence?" Kim asked.
"I should probably think about packing soon," Jay responded with forced casualness.
"You haven't started yet? The dress code for the evening events alone requires serious planning." Luc asked.
"The dinner on the first night is always elegant. Business casual at minimum, though most people dress up more than that." Amy explained. 
"And the pool parties can get pretty wild," Max added with obvious enthusiasm.
Jay's anxiety began to spike as the conversation continued. Pool parties, bonfire nights on the beach, sunset dinners with senior partners—none of these activities fit with his limited wardrobe of work suits and basic casual wear.
"What about the beach bonfire? What does everyone usually wear for that?" 
"You want to look good but not overdressed. Think expensive jeans, quality polo shirts, maybe a nice jacket for when it gets cooler," Ela said immediately. 
"The key is looking effortless. Like you just threw on whatever was closest but it happened to be straight off this season’s runway," Kim chimed in.
Everyone laughed at the comment, but Jay recognized the underlying truth. His colleagues possessed an intuitive understanding of social dress codes that he had never developed. They knew how to calibrate their appearance for different contexts, oscillating between formality and sophisticated casual wear.
"I should probably do some shopping," Jay admitted, hoping his voice didn't betray his growing panic. 
"Definitely. There are some great places downtown if you want to invest in pieces you'll actually wear again." Ela agreed enthusiastically.
"Ela and I can give you some recommendations. There are a few boutiques that specialize in exactly what you'll need." Amy said.
"The important thing is getting the foundation right. A few really good pieces that you can mix and match for different events." Ela added.
Jay felt overwhelmed as his colleagues began discussing specific stores, brands, and styling approaches. Their advice came from a desire to help, but it also highlighted how much he still didn't know about the social aspects of this world.
"Don't worry," Max said, apparently noticing Jay's expression. "Everyone feels underprepared for their first retreat. The important thing is showing up and being yourself." 
"Easy for you to say," Luc replied. "You've been doing this for years. Jay's only just walking into social events with senior partners. The pressure is real."
The observation did little to calm Jay’s nerves, though he appreciated Luc’s recognition of the subtext. This wasn't just casual socializing—it was networking disguised as recreational activity. Jay made mental notes about everything his colleagues mentioned, each detail added to his growing to-do list for the weekend.
By the time Jay made his excuses two hours later, he had barely managed half of the terrible beer. He thanked everyone for their patience with his beverage complaints and headed home feeling both invigorated by the friction-free social outing and increasingly anxious about his lack of preparation.
Scene 4
Shopping spree
Jay spent Friday evening turning his dining table into a strategic planning centre, spreading out handwritten notes with his colleagues' advice alongside printouts of store locations and hours. The boutiques Ela and Amy had recommended clustered in the fashion district, an area of the city he had visited perhaps twice in his entire life. He studied the information, creating a route that would maximize his time. The prices he had researched online made his stomach clench, but he reminded himself that this was an investment in his future.
Dinner attire occupied the top priority, but he also needed swimming shorts, casual resort wear, and something appropriate for other evening events. The challenge was finding clothes that looked suitable without making him stand out as either under-dressed or trying too hard. 
Jay woke Saturday morning determined, approaching the shopping trip as though it were a mission. He ate a big breakfast, knowing from experience that shopping required sustained energy, then reviewed his notes one final time before heading out, armed with his itinerary.
His first stop was a menswear boutique that Ela had specifically recommended for "foundation pieces that work across multiple contexts." The sales associate was an impeccably dressed man in his thirties, clearly used to sizing up customers’ needs and budgets, and he assessed Jay with a critical glance.
"I need clothes for a corporate retreat. Pool parties, beach events, dinners with clients." Jay explained.
"Certainly. Let's start with the basics and build from there."
The associate steered Jay toward pieces that could transition between formal and everyday settings, explaining the differences between resort casual and weekend casual that Jay would never have understood independently.
"This polo is versatile enough for pool events but sophisticated enough for dinner if you pair it with the right trousers," he explained, adjusting the collar.
Jay tried on several polo shirts, examining himself in mirrors that seemed designed to highlight every flaw in his posture and bearing. The associate offered guidance about fit and styling, suggesting choices that would work for multiple occasions.
A warm sand blazer that could work for the sunset dinner but also evening drinks. Chinos in earthy colours that paired with both polo shirts and button-downs. A selection of shirts that looked effortless but refined.
"Quality over quantity. Better to have fewer pieces that work perfectly than a closet full of clothes that never quite fit the occasion," the associate advised.
By the time Jay left the boutique, he had acquired two bags full of clothes, but his list remained only partially complete. Pool attire, beach outfits, casual shoes, and various accessories still needed attention.
The second boutique focused on what they called "resort wear," and Jay discovered that clothes designed for wealthy people's vacations constituted an entire category he had never known existed. Linen shirts with, lightweight trousers, jackets that could transition from beach to dinner settings.
"The key is quality fabrics that photograph well. Natural fibres, good drape, colours that work in different lighting conditions", the sales associate explained while showing him a selection of shirts.
Jay hadn't considered that his clothes would need to photograph well, but the comment made sense given the likelihood of group photos during retreat activities.
By the third store, Jay's decision-making abilities had deteriorated. The constant choices between similar-looking items and the pressure to understand distinctions he had never needed to consider started to create mental exhaustion.
Nearly four hours had passed since he’d left home, and he was already tired and hungry. Still, with plenty left on his list, he grabbed a quick, unremarkable lunch at a nearby restaurant before heading back out. There was no time to linger or enjoy the break, so he simply regrouped and continued his shopping spree.
The swimming shorts required more consideration than he'd expected. The swimwear boutique salesperson assured him that board shorts in blue were both practical and appropriate for any setting. Jay trusted her judgement, having no framework for evaluating swimwear beyond basic coverage. He finally selected swim shorts in classic navy and a more adventurous pair with subtle patterns, hoping they struck the right balance between appropriate and interesting.
Three stores later, laden with shopping bags and feeling the fatigue that came from making countless micro-decisions about style and fit, Jay sought refuge in a café. The establishment catered to shoppers taking breaks from their retail expeditions, offering comfortable seating and prices that matched its exclusive neighbourhood.
Jay ordered coffee and a pastry, spreading his remaining shopping list across the small table. He had completed most of his intended purchases, but the process wa far more exhausting than he had anticipated. Every item required consideration of versatility, quality, and cost. The sheer number of variables involved in selecting clothes that would allow him to blend into his colleagues' social world felt overwhelming.
Jay finished his coffee and returned to his mission. The afternoon progressed through a succession of boutiques, each specializing in different aspects of his wardrobe requirements. Casual shoes that looked expensive but comfortable enough for walking on sand. A lightweight jacket for evening beach gatherings. Short sleeved shirts in colours that complemented his complexion without being too bold. At each store, he relied heavily on sales associates' guidance, acutely aware of his own ignorance about fashion matters.
His biggest purchase was a new suitcase, an upgrade from the secondhand case that had served him since college. The quality luggage commanded prices that made him pause, but his tolerance for necessary expenses had grown. The investment felt justified by the battered condition of his current case.
The total bill was another blow to his frugal sensibilities, though not the devastating expense of his winter emergency shopping—roughly equivalent to two months of his previous salary, which was still less that he earned now. He consoled himself that at least this time he hadn't spent thousands on a single outfit. More concerning was his uncertainty about whether the assembled wardrobe would actually achieve its intended purpose.
When he returned home with a suitcase full of expensive clothing, Jay sighed heavily at the sight of his overcrowded closet. He'd have to donate another round of older pieces to make room, a cycle that was becoming unfortunately familiar.
He tried everything on again, critically examining his reflection. The clothes fit well enough, though he looked pale and slightly too thin. The winter flu had taken weight he hadn't quite regained, leaving him with sharper angles than he remembered. At least he didn't have to worry about a beer belly.

Scene 5
Growing uncertainty
Jay returned to work Monday satisfied. His new wardrobe hung neatly in his closet, tags removed and items organized by function, ready for the upcoming retreat. The weekend's shopping expedition had been exhausting but productive, and he felt reasonably confident about his preparations. 
That confidence lasted exactly three days.
By Wednesday, as the retreat discussion intensified around the office, Jay began to understand that he had seriously miscalculated the sunset dinner's importance and dress expectations. 
Amy and Ela exchanged recommendations for designer evening wear, their casual mentions of brand names and price ranges making Jay realize he’d underestimated the event’s formality.
“I’m thinking the Cél d’Ambroisie wrap dress with the Aul Ciel sandals for the sunset dinner,” Amy explained during lunch.
“I’m going with the Bas Roque jacket with the new Eno Aquila shirt. Classic but not boring,” Max added.
Even Kim, who typically dressed simply, mentioned designer pieces that Jay recognized from his brief exposure to high-end fashion magazines. The casual way his colleagues discussed garments costing thousands suggested that such expenditures were routine.
Jay cornered Luc on Thursday, trying for casual curiosity. "What's the actual dress code for the dinner party?"
"It's probably the single most important social event of the year. The black-tie gala is elegant, sure, but it's also pretty conservative. Everyone wears standard formal wear and calls it a day. The annual retreat dinner is where people really outdo themselves."
Jay's stomach dropped. "No pressure, right?"
"Of course not. Just wear the best suit you have so Ian doesn't have to be ashamed of our team."
The comment was clearly meant as friendly teasing, but it landed heavily. Jay spent the rest of the afternoon reviewing his wardrobe mentally, finding it increasingly inadequate.
That evening, Jay stood in his bedroom surveying his closet with growing dismay. His suits were well-made, but they were also clearly designed for office environments. The cuts were too formal, the overall effect too business-like for an event that apparently required sophisticated leisure wear.
He had made a fundamental error in understanding the retreat's social dynamics. This wasn't travel with recreational activities—it was social theatre with business implications.
With less than a week remaining before departure, Jay faced the uncomfortable reality that his wardrobe preparations remained incomplete. His casual resort wear would serve adequately for most activities, but the sunset dinner required something he didn't possess and couldn't acquire through normal retail channels in the time available.
He regretted not buying a lighter summer suit when there was still time. The weather forecast promised hot, sunny days that would make his winter-weight clothing uncomfortable. His new casual pieces would work fine during the day, but they were absolutely unsuitable for a prestigious evening event. 
He considered the extravagant outfit from his last shopping emergency, but the memory of the attention it drew still made his skin crawl. It had been far too flashy for his taste, and wearing it again was out of the question.
After a day of internal debate, Jay accepted that desperate times called for desperate measures. On Friday afternoon, he walked reluctantly toward Hathaway’s Menswear, the boutique where he had previously spent an unconscionable amount of money on a single outfit. That purchase had been too beautiful, too expensive, and too conspicuous for his taste. He regretted the cost every day, yet here he was again, hoping for something equally polished but less likely to draw every eye in the room.
The same sales associate recognized him immediately, greeting him warmly. This time, at least, Jay wasn’t in such a desperate hurry. He could appreciate the quality of the service.
“Good afternoon, sir. How did the earlier purchase work out for you?”
“Very well, thank you,” Jay replied, and it was true, though the success of that outfit came with complicated emotions.
“What can I help you with today?”
Jay took a breath, deciding honesty would serve him better than trying to project sophistication he didn’t possess. “I need something suitable for a very high-level evening event. But I’d prefer not to bankrupt myself in the process.”
The associate’s expression suggested he understood both requirements perfectly. “Of course, sir. Let me show you some options.”
The fitting process was far more deliberate than during Jay’s previous, frantic visit. The associate began with a round of bold runway pieces, a silk shirt missing half its buttons, trousers that clung to him like a second skin.
Jay stepped out of the fitting room, tugging at the waistband. “I think these might be… a little ambitious for me.”
The associate’s mouth twitched in what might have been amusement. “Too fashion-forward?”
“Yeah, something like that. Can we try something more conservative?”
“Of course, sir. Something more classic.”
The next selections were much closer to his comfort zone. Dress shirts with subtle textures, trousers that followed his frame without advertising it, jackets that felt structured but not stiff. The fabrics were exquisite, the cuts flattering.
When he finally stepped out in a beige sport coat over a light gray shirt and perfectly fitted trousers, the associate nodded once. “That works. Understated, but you won’t disappear in a crowd. Both the jacket and trousers are from van Haaren’s current collection, and the shirt is Mai Huysmans. Au courant choices, guaranteed to make a proper impression.”
Jay had never heard of either brand in his life, but judging from the success of his previous outfit, he could trust his word.
“This one,” he said. It was the least expensive option so far, though it still claimed a significant portion of his monthly salary. At least this time, the cost stayed below his paycheck, and the overall look felt presentable without screaming for attention.
The associate handled the transaction with the same discretion Jay remembered, arranging for minor alterations to be completed by Monday morning and ensuring every detail met his requirements.
Walking to the metro, Jay thought that his change from someone who had shopped exclusively at department stores to someone who could walk into Hathaway’s Menswear and purchase designer garments felt surreal.
The financial damage from his retreat preparations hurt. Between the weekend shopping expedition and today's purchase, he had spent the equivalent of five months' salary from his previous job. But he had also acquired a wardrobe that would allow him to participate fully in Turner & Associates' traditions without embarrassment or anxiety about his appearance.
Most importantly, Jay was satisfied with his choices. The clothes looked good, fit well, and projected exactly the image he wanted to present. He felt confident that his appearance wouldn't undermine his social integration. Whatever the retreat would demand of him, at least he'd be appropriately dressed for it. The knowledge provided some comfort, even as his bank account protested the expense.
Chapter 17: Retreat
Scene 1
Arrival
The buses waited outside Northlight Financial Center at ten sharp, five pristine carriages that could have transported twice their number in comfort. Jay had risen at seven for his eight o’clock appointment at the same salon where he’d had his hair cut months earlier, having booked an early slot in advance so he wouldn’t spend the day worrying about his appearance.
The stylist remembered him, working to create something polished but not overly formal. Jay left feeling properly groomed for whatever the evening would demand, a small weight lifted from his shoulders.
He wore his new cream slacks and a short-sleeved button-down shirt, aiming for semi-business casual since his standard weekend attire consisted of sweatpants and old t-shirts with strategic holes. Around him, his colleagues had embraced the casual dress code with obvious relief. Luc appeared in jeans and a vintage band t-shirt, while Kim wore an actual tracksuit that somehow managed to look expensive.
The women had clearly spent their mornings at beauty appointments, their hair and makeup immaculate. They'd all had the same thought—get the grooming done early so the evening preparations would be simple.
Ian was the sole exception to casual Friday, wearing a summer-weight suit in pale gray that looked both elegant and seasonally appropriate. He sat down with his laptop, clearly intending to work the entire journey.
The team claimed places near the front of the first bus, everyone granted a double seat to themselves. Their luggage had been expertly loaded by staff, requiring no effort from the passengers beyond showing up on time.
Jay sat by a window, watching the city buildings give way to suburbs and then open countryside. The bus was more comfortable than any vehicle he'd ever ridden, with leather seating and climate control that made the journey feel effortless.
Amy, Ela, Max, and Luc shared stories from previous retreats. Kim remained absorbed in his phone, while Zoe dozed peacefully across the aisle. Ian's keyboard provided a soundtrack of white noise.
"The spa at last year's location was incredible. I still think about that hot stone massage," Amy said.
"Remember the golf tournament? Leo spent more time in the sand traps than on the fairway," Max added with a chuckle.
"At least he didn't fall off the yacht during the regatta. Though watching him try to sail was entertainment enough," Ela replied.
Jay was caught between listening to the office gossip and absorbing the changing landscape outside his window. He rarely traveled beyond the city limits, and the rolling hills and distant mountains felt like a revelation.
Quality snacks appeared at regular intervals, served by attentive staff who seemed to anticipate every need. Jay helped himself to things he found delicious. The entire experience felt way too fancy for a simple bus ride.
As they approached the coast, the scenery became breathtaking. Jay pressed closer to the window, watching the land flatten and the air take on a different quality. When the ocean finally appeared, vast and glittering in the afternoon sun, he forgot to participate in conversation entirely.
"Do you like the seaside?" Ian's voice came from directly behind him, quiet enough not to interrupt the others.
Jay turned, surprised by the personal question. "I love it, actually. Though I've only visited once in my life."
"The ambient noise of the waves and the salt air are delightful," Ian said.
"Very calming. The large expanse of water puts everything in perspective."
"If the city were closer to the shore, I'd probably get a yacht."
Jay laughed. "You definitely look like someone who owns a yacht."
"I'll take that as a compliment. Though I'm not sure what yacht-owning appearance entails."
The resort appeared as they crested a hill, a collection of elegant buildings nestled between manicured gardens and pristine beach. Staff waited at the entrance with welcome drinks and clipboards, orchestrating the controlled chaos of hundred-odd people disembarking simultaneously. Jay accepted a glass of a fruity and tropical cocktail, marvelling at the seamless organization. 
"Mr. Hall?" A young woman with a tablet appeared at his elbow. "You're in Seaview Suite fourteen with Mr. Hagen. Here's your keycard and welcome packet."
She handed him a leather folder containing his room key, a detailed schedule, and a map of the property. Everything was handled like a military operation.
Most of his colleagues headed directly to their accommodations to change into something more suitable for the seaside setting. Jay examined his current outfit and decided it would suffice—he had no desire to change clothes three times before dinner.
Instead, he explored the premises, impressed by the top-tier amenities. The grounds were immaculate, the architecture designed to complement the natural beauty of the coastline.
Lunch began at one-thirty on a spectacular patio overlooking the ocean. Small tables dotted the space, encouraging mingling while offering various vantage points for the view. Chefs worked at outdoor stations, preparing dishes Jay couldn't identify but found irresistible.
He claimed a table with the best ocean view and lounged there like a true country bumpkin, alternately staring at the waves and sampling tropical skewers that combined sweet and spicy flavours.
The atmosphere was so relaxed it seemed to affect everyone, even Ian, who actually joined in with the joking. The sea breeze kept the temperature comfortable despite the warm sun, and Jay enjoyed every aspects of the meal.
After lunch concluded, people dispersed to their rooms to prepare for the afternoon's activities. Jay consulted his materials, locating his room number on the provided map. When he finally found it, Ian was already there, sitting at the desk with his laptop open.
"Shouldn't this be time for rest, not work?" Jay asked, setting down his keycard.
"Don't mind me. The habit is too ingrained to change now." Ian replied without looking up.
Ian had claimed the bed closer to the window, leaving Jay the one near the bathroom. The room was comfortably spacious, with a seating area and a secluded balcony with an excellent view of the coastline.
Jay took time to explore, amazed by the quality of everything. The bathroom was enormous, every fixture speaking to the standard of the hotel. The beds looked like they could accommodate three people comfortably.
He lay down for a moment, listening to the rhythmic clicking of Ian's keyboard. The sound was soothing, reminding him if countless late evenings at the office.
"I hope you don't snore," Ian said suddenly, his tone light with attempted humour.
"Not to my knowledge. But if I do, feel free to strangle me in my sleep."
Ian's chuckle indicated the comment had achieved its intended effect. Jay unpacked, inspecting his evening outfit for wrinkles before hanging it in his designated closet. Everything looked acceptable, though he still felt under-dressed compared to what his colleagues would likely wear.
The afternoon's first event was scheduled for four o'clock—an art exhibition featuring renowned local painters displaying their works in a gallery space adjacent to the main resort. Jay left early, while Ian insisted he needed to finish whatever demanded his attention.
The team gathered in the exhibition hall, consulting their informational booklets while examining the displayed pieces. Jay knew nothing about art, so he adopted a strategy of walking slowly and appearing thoughtfully engaged.
Ian appeared eventually, moving through the space as if he was deeply knowledgeable about art. He paused before a landscape piece, studying it with obvious interest.
"That one's charming," he commented when Jay approached.
"I wouldn't know charm from disaster. My cultural education was somewhat limited."
"When in doubt, comment on the bold artistic expression. It's always safe."
They walked together for a while, with Ian commenting occasionally on the artworks. Jay drew reassurance from having Ian beside him in the intimidating environment, though he tried not to depend on him too obviously.
Eventually their paths diverged, and Jay gravitated toward Luc, who was examining a sculpture.
"Everyone looks so impressed. I have no idea what's happening," Jay said quietly.
"Neither do I. But we're doing an excellent job of pretending otherwise."
Artists in flamboyant outfits circulated through the space, explaining their work to anyone who would listen. Jay made it his mission to avoid them, while Ian moved between conversations, even purchasing some pieces.
Jay noticed small ribbons appearing on certain frames—sold pieces, he assumed, though the prices remained absent from public view. Ian's choices seemed random to Jay's untrained eye, no more notable than the works that remained available.
Jay eventually stopped before a large abstract piece, bright colours arranged in harmonious patterns that somehow pleased his eye despite his general confusion about art.
"Do you like it?" Ian asked, appearing beside him.
"If I'm being honest, this is the only one here I actually like," Jay admitted.
"I find it appealing as well. If you don't mind, I'd like to purchase it."
Jay laughed. "There's no way in hell I could afford something like this. I can only assume that this exhibition is way above my pay grade."
An attendant appeared within minutes, attaching a ribbon to the frame. The artist materialized shortly after, effusive in his gratitude and eager to discuss his inspiration with the buyer. Ian responded diplomatically while Jay tried to edge away unnoticed. But the painter caught sight of him and asked for his opinion on the piece.
"Bold choices," Jay mumbled, remembering Ian's earlier advice.
Ian's mouth twitched with suppressed amusement, but he maintained his serious expression throughout the artist's enthusiastic explanation of colour theory and emotional resonance.
As people began leaving the gallery, Jay seized his opportunity and made his escape as soon as politeness allowed. He definitely didn't belong at such events, but all things considered, it hadn't been terrible.
Scene 2
The sunset dinner
Jay returned to their room directly from the gallery, wanting to prepare without rushing. The bathroom was spacious enough to serve as a dressing room, with mirrors that provided every possible angle. He spread his evening outfit across the marble counter, taking inventory of each piece.
The ensemble from Hathaway's Menswear looked great, suggesting expensive taste without shouting about it. Jay changed, checking his reflection from multiple angles. The clothes fit him well, transforming his plainness into sophistication. His hair still held its morning styling, and overall he looked polished without appearing to try too hard. The investment had been worth every uncomfortable penny.
When he emerged from the bathroom, Ian was already in the room, laying his own evening wear across his bed. Both men froze momentarily.
"You look..." Ian began, then stopped, his composure faltering slightly. "Very appropriate for the evening."
Jay felt warmth rise in his cheeks. "The salesman knew what he was doing."
"Clearly." Ian's response was brief, but his gaze lingered before he turned back to his preparations.
Jay sat on the plush armchair by the window, watching the sun begin its descent toward the horizon. Ian moved around the room, gathering his clothes before disappearing into the bathroom. Jay tried to focus on the ocean view, but his thoughts kept circling back to Ian's reaction.
Ten minutes later, Ian emerged wearing a perfectly tailored three-piece navy suit with a white shirt and silver tie, a folded silk pocket square sitting neatly in his breast pocket. A platinum tie pin and discreet cufflinks completed the ensemble. The cut sharpened his already commanding silhouette, and the colour set a cooler edge to the blue of his eyes.
"Ready?" Ian asked.
"Ready," Jay confirmed, though he felt anything but.
They left the room together, walking toward the elevator, both lost in their own thoughts. Jay wondered if he would embarrass himself at dinner, while Ian struggled with the fact that "appropriate" had been a woefully inadequate description of how Jay looked.
The dinner venue occupied the entire top floor, with panoramic windows showcasing the spectacular sunset. Round tables draped in cream linen bore plate settings that belonged in museums. The decor managed to be both opulent and tasteful, with fresh flowers arranged in crystalline vases and ambient lighting that made everyone appear touched by golden hour magic.
Jay was struck by how beautiful his colleagues looked in their evening wear. The casual atmosphere of the afternoon had given way to glamour that belonged in magazines. Ela wore a flowing midnight blue dress, while Amy had chosen emerald green that complemented her dark hair.
They found their assigned table near the windows, where the sea stretched endlessly beyond the glass. Jay took his seat between Luc and Amy, with Ian directly across from him.
"This is incredible," Amy said, gesturing toward the view. "Look how the light hits the water."
Foreign chefs from renowned restaurants had been brought in specifically for the evening, and each course arrived like a small work of art. Jay studied the first dish, unsure what half the ingredients were but willing to try everything. The presentation was so elaborate it seemed wrong to disturb it with his fork.
"What do you think that is?" Luc asked, pointing to a delicate purple garnish.
"Bold artistic expression," Jay replied without thinking, then caught Ian's amused look across the table.
The wine pairings were explained with each serving, and despite his caution with alcohol, Jay accepted each glass. Everything was more complex and sophisticated than anything he'd experienced before, yet somehow the unfamiliarity felt manageable with his colleagues around him.
As the evening progressed, live music began and desserts appeared that looked too beautiful to eat. The wine and cocktail bar opened in full swing, with bartenders creating drinks that sparkled and smoked. Jay accepted whatever was offered, more relaxed than usual in such a formal setting.
Turner senior gave a brief speech about company achievements and future goals, his words predictably dull but mercifully short. When he finished, the formal structure dissolved into mingling and conversation that flowed as freely as the alcohol.
Jay chatted easily with people he barely knew from other departments. The wine had mellowed his social anxiety, making conversations feel less fraught. When Jen from accounting approached, he welcomed her into the group without suspicion.
"You look wonderful tonight, Jay," she said, moving closer than necessary.
"Thanks. The salesman picked everything out for me."
"I bet you could wear anything and look good."
"I think that's giving me too much credit."
Her laugh seemed disproportionate to his comment, but Jay was too focused on the conversation around him to analyse why. 
"Your shirt really brings out your eyes," she said, moving closer.
"Bold choice by the designer," Jay replied seriously.
"I love a man who pays attention to fashion."
"The fabric quality is quite good."
Jen laughed, moving even closer. "You're funny when you're relaxed."
Luc watched this exchange with growing discomfort before finally intervening. "Jay, want to see the balcony? The view from up here is supposed to be amazing."
"Absolutely," Jay agreed readily, following Luc outside.
The balcony wrapped around the building's corner, offering an unobstructed view of the water. The sunset painted everything in shades of gold and pink, and Jay stared in wonder at the sight.
"Everyone's being super friendly tonight," he observed, swaying slightly in the evening breeze.
"That's one way to put it," Luc replied dryly.
Jay continued admiring the view, oblivious to the rescue that had just occurred. The alcohol had made everything seem pleasant and unthreatening, including attention he would normally find uncomfortable.
From inside, Ian watched through the glass doors with frustration. Leo appeared at his side, clearly entertained by the evening's developments.
"Your assistant has become quite the social butterfly."
"He's enjoying himself."
"Jen certainly thinks so. She's been circling him all evening."
Ian's grip tightened on his glass. "She's being friendly."
"That's one word for it. Though he seems completely oblivious to her intentions. Actually, he seems oblivious to most things right now."
"He doesn't drink often," Ian said, his attention fixed on Jay's animated conversation with a group from the risk management.
"Protective of him, aren't you?"
Ian ignored him completely, watching Jay's profile against the sunset. The evening light caught in Jay's dark hair and emphasized the delicate lines of his face.
When Jay returned inside, he drifted through the crowd with a dreamy smile, nodding agreeably at whoever spoke to him. His responses had devolved into variations of "bold artistic expression" regardless of the topic, which amused some people and confused others. It was the first time Ian had seen Jay truly drunk, and the change from his usual restraint was both endearing and concerning.
Ian tracked Jay's movements from across the room, monitoring his comfort level and ready to intervene if the conversation overwhelmed him. By eleven o'clock, Jay was visibly unsteady but still smiling, accepting drinks from anyone who offered them. Jen had made several more attempts to capture his attention, each more obvious than the last, but Jay responded to her flirtation with the same oblivious politeness he showed everyone. 
Ian finally approached when Jay nearly stumbled while reaching for yet another cocktail, placing a steadying hand on his elbow.
"I think it's time we called it an evening."
Jay looked up at him with glassy eyes and a docile expression. "If you think so."
The compliance was a welcome development. He guided Jay toward the exit, nodding politely at colleagues who called out goodnight wishes.
The elevator ride passed in silence, Jay leaning against the wall with his eyes half-closed. When they reached their room, Ian unlocked the door and ushered Jay inside.
"Will you be alright?" Ian asked, watching Jay sway slightly on his feet.
"Going right to sleep," Jay mumbled, already tugging his shirt over his head.
Ian caught a glimpse of pale skin and the lean lines of Jay's torso before panic seized him. He fled the room without another word, his heart hammering against his ribs as he made his way back to the elevator.
Back at the venue, Ian made his way directly to the bar and ordered something strong enough to burn away the image seared into his memory. The party continued around him, colleagues laughing and dancing, but he remained focused solely on the task of drowning his inappropriate thoughts in liquor. Shortly after midnight, worry finally overcame his need for distance.
When Ian returned to their room, alarm shot through him at the sight of Jay's empty bed. Then he noticed light spilling from beneath the bathroom door.
"Jay?" He knocked gently. "Are you alright?"
Splashing sounds were followed by Jay's voice, slightly slurred but coherent. "I'll be out in a minute."
Ten minutes later, Jay emerged in loose gray pyjamas and with damp hair. The bathroom released a cloud of floral-scented steam.
"Sorry. I wanted a bath and I think I fell asleep in there."
He dropped onto his bed with a contented sigh, pulling the covers up to his chin. Within moments his breathing had evened out into sleep, leaving Ian alone with thoughts that grew more complicated by the minute.
Ian stepped onto the balcony, retrieving the pack of cigarettes he kept for emergencies. He'd quit smoking years ago, but tonight qualified as a crisis that warranted breaking old promises to himself. The nicotine helped steady his nerves, though it did nothing to stop the yearning that seemed to grow stronger with every innocent gesture Jay made.
After finishing his cigarette, Ian returned inside and prepared for bed, moving quietly to avoid waking Jay. He lay awake long after his shower, listening to Jay's peaceful breathing and wondering how much longer he could maintain the charade.
Scene 3
Pool party
Jay woke to a pounding headache that felt like someone was using his skull as a drum. He groaned and pressed his palms against his temples, trying to block out the morning light filtering through the curtains.
"There's water and painkillers on the bedside table," Ian's voice came from across the room.
Jay shuffled around blindly until his fingers found the glass and pills. The water was blissfully cold against his parched throat, and he drained half of the glass before collapsing back onto his pillow.
"What time is it?" he mumbled.
"Seven. You can take it slow—breakfast runs until eleven."
Jay forced himself into a sitting position and saw Ian propped up in his own bed, laptop balanced on his knees. He wore silk pyjamas in silver, looking elegant even first thing in the morning. The sight made Jay acutely aware of his own rumpled state.
He finished the glass of water and groaned again. "I can't remember how I got back here."
"I helped you to the room when you looked like you'd had enough," Ian replied without looking up from his screen.
Heat flooded Jay's cheeks. "God, I'm sorry. I hope I didn't make a scene."
"You didn't. These events are specifically designed for employees to get drunk and blow off steam. You have nothing to apologize for. Did you have fun?"
"I did. The evening was lovely, though I wish I hadn't drunk quite so much."
"Good wine can sneak up on you."
Jay rubbed his forehead. "Thanks for looking out for me."
"Would you like coffee?" Ian asked, closing his laptop.
"You don't need to tend to me."
"I want coffee myself. I would have made it earlier, but I didn't want to wake you."
Jay nodded, and Ian rose from bed to operate the coffee machine tucked into the room's small kitchenette. Jay was surprised such equipment existed in hotel rooms, but then again, this wasn't exactly a typical hotel.
The rich smell of brewing coffee gradually filled the space. Ian returned with two steaming cups, handing one to Jay before sitting back on his bed with his laptop.
"Do you always work?" Jay asked, cradling the warm mug.
"Not always, but often enough. A company retreat feels like the perfect environment for uninterrupted productivity."
Jay dropped back onto his pillow and whimpered pitifully. His head still felt like it was splitting open, and his stomach churned with every movement. The painkillers couldn't start working fast enough.
They sat in silence for a while, Ian typing while Jay focused on not dying. The coffee helped marginally, warming his throat and providing something to concentrate on besides his misery.
"You talk in your sleep," Ian said suddenly.
Jay's eyes snapped open. "That's impossible."
"Who's Rus?"
Jay felt his face burn with mortification. "He's my gym trainer."
Ian looked surprised. "You go to the gym?"
"Sporadically. Just to stay in minimal shape."
"You were whimpering as if Rus was causing you great distress."
"He might as well be. The rowing machine leaves me crying."
Ian's mouth quirked upward slightly before he returned to his work. They lapsed back into silence, Jay slowly sipping his coffee and willing himself to feel human again.
Eventually the painkillers began to take effect, dulling the worst of his headache. He managed to drag himself to the bathroom for a cold shower, letting the water shock some life back into his system.
When he emerged, dressed in fresh cream slacks and a light green shirt with rolled sleeves, he felt marginally more like a functioning person. Still wobbly and slightly nauseous, but no longer actively dying.
"You'll feel better once you eat breakfast," Ian observed.
Jay weighed the prospect with uncertainty. "I'm not sure I'm quite ready to tackle the world outside."
"Sit on the balcony for a bit. Fresh air will help."
Jay followed the suggestion, stepping onto the small balcony and breathing deeply. The view was spectacular in the morning light, waves catching the sun like scattered diamonds. The salt breeze did help clear his head, though his stomach remained unconvinced about the wisdom of existing.
When he returned inside, Ian was dressed in his usual impeccable style—a lightweight suit that looked both elegant and appropriate for the seaside setting. Jay wondered if Ian owned anything that didn't fit perfectly.
"Ready?" Ian asked, adjusting his tie.
"As I'll ever be."
They made their way to the breakfast restaurant, which offered an impressive array of fresh options spread across multiple stations. Jay filled his plate with whatever looked appealing and was unlikely to make him sick, while Ian selected mostly vegetables and fish.
They claimed a table with a clear view of the sea, and other guests moved at the leisurely pace of people recovering from the previous evening's festivities. Jay discovered that food did indeed help—after working through his selections and another cup of coffee, the worst of his hangover began to retreat.
The rest of their team trickled in gradually, looking various degrees of worse for wear. Amy appeared with sunglasses despite being indoors, while Luc moved slowly, trying not to disturb his own head.
"At least this time Jay didn't hide in the bathroom," Max said with a grin as he joined their table.
"I was perfectly social," Jay protested mildly.
"You were chatting with everyone. Very unlike your usual wallflower routine," Ela added, holding coffee and a plate with exclusively fruit.
The teasing was good-natured. They lingered over breakfast, no one eager to move faster than absolutely necessary.
Eventually someone reminded everyone that the pool party was scheduled to begin at eleven, which prompted a gradual exodus back to rooms for swimwear changes.
Jay and Ian returned to their shared space, where the prospect of changing clothes created a new source of anxiety for Jay. His new swim trunks were supposed to be appropriate for a resort, but he still felt self-conscious, imagining everyone else would be dressed in designer beachwear.
When Ian emerged from the bathroom in shorts that emphasized his athletic build, Jay felt his self-consciousness spike dramatically. Ian's physique was exactly what Jay had suspected—broad shoulders, defined muscles, and proportional perfection that came from dedicated fitness routines. His skin had a light tan that hinted at regular outdoor activity, and everything about him screamed peak physical condition.
Jay felt like a pale, soft slug by comparison, but Ian offered no commentary as they gathered towels and headed to the pool area.
The resort's pool was enormous, with multiple sections for different activities. Some colleagues were already splashing around with pool balls, while others floated lazily on inflatable devices, clearly still recovering from the previous evening.
Jay found a quiet corner where he could wade around without calling attention to himself. Ian headed directly to the lap lanes and began swimming with a beautiful stroke that indicated serious training.
"Of course he's doing actual exercise," Luc said, appearing beside Jay with a shake of his head. "Either working or working out, just like we said."
Jay watched Ian cut through the water with powerful movements. Even at a company retreat designed for relaxation, Ian couldn't resist optimizing his time.
"Some people never turn off," Jay observed.
Scene 4
Scuba diving
After the pool party ended, lunch was served on the seafront terrace—light fare designed for people planning to spend the afternoon underwater. Jay selected grilled fish, his appetite finally returning to normal. The hangover had mostly ended, leaving him with anticipation for the day's main event.
The scuba diving excursion had been the retreat's centrepiece since the planning stages. Jay had signed up despite his limited swimming ability, drawn by the novelty and the promise that extensive instruction would be provided. Now, watching the sleek diving boats being prepared at the resort's private dock, his excitement mixed with nervousness.
"First time diving?" asked one of the instructors as she checked equipment lists.
"First time doing anything more adventurous than a public swimming pool," Jay admitted.
She smiled reassuringly. "You'll love it. The conditions here are perfect—calm water, excellent visibility, and marine life that's used to divers."
Most groups were divided by skill level, but at Ian’s request, Jay was placed with him and the others to make sure he felt comfortable. Both Ian and Zoe could offer guidance—Ian and Luc had extensive training, and Zoe, who actually held an instructor certification, seemed excited to get back underwater.
"You'll be fine," Zoe told Jay as they boarded their designated boat. "The hardest part is remembering to breathe normally. Everything else is just floating around and looking at pretty fish."
"I had no idea you were certified," Jay said.
"There's a lot we don't know about each other. I've been diving since college. It's the closest thing to flying I've ever experienced."
The boat ride took them to a protected cove where the water was crystal clear and teeming with colourful marine life. Glass-bottom boats hosted the non-divers, offering views of the underwater world from above along with cocktails and music. Jay almost envied their safer option as he struggled into his wetsuit.
Ian appeared beside him, already fully equipped and looking completely at ease. "Need help with anything?"
Jay fumbled with his mask straps. "I'm starting to think this was overly ambitious."
Ian adjusted the straps. "The equipment does most of the work. You just have to trust it."
The instructor gathered their small group for final instructions, covering hand signals and emergency procedures that made Jay's stomach flutter with anxiety. When they finally entered the water for practice runs, Jay's natural clumsiness seemed magnified by the unfamiliar gear.
"Breathe slowly and deeply," Ian said, his voice muffled but calm through the underwater communication system. "Don't fight the water."
Jay tried to follow the advice, though his instinct was to panic at the strange sensation of breathing through the regulator. Ian stayed close, occasionally reaching out to steady him when his buoyancy control faltered.
Once they descended to the reef proper, Jay forgot his nervousness entirely. The underwater landscape was unlike anything he'd imagined—coral formations in impossible colours, schools of tropical fish that moved like living rainbows, and a sense of weightless peace that made the surface world feel distant and unimportant.
He watched Ian almost as much as the marine life. Ian moved through the water with the same grace he brought to everything else, pointing out interesting creatures and staying within arm's reach without making it obvious he was monitoring Jay's comfort.
Zoe lived up to her reputation, swimming circles around them in fluid movements, completely at home underwater. She guided them toward a small cave where larger fish sheltered in the shadows, her enthusiasm infectious even through diving masks and regulators. When they finally surfaced, Jay felt exhilarated.
"That was incredible. I can't believe I've never done this before."
"The reef here is spectacular. Most diving locations don't offer this variety of marine life," Ian replied, helping him climb back aboard.
Back on the boat, Jay watched the underwater world through the glass bottom while the others prepared for a second dive. The peaceful rhythm of fish movements and swaying coral was hypnotic, and he understood why people became obsessed with the sport.
By late afternoon, everyone had returned to shore with stories of underwater encounters and waterproof camera shots to share. Jay felt proud of conquering something that had seemed impossible that morning, and deeply aware of how much Ian’s patient guidance had helped him through the experience.
The evening's bonfire dinner took place directly on the beach, with multiple fire pits creating warm circles of light against the darkening sky. Tables groaned under the weight of grilled seafood, roasted vegetables, and tropical fruits, while staff tended enormous bonfires that sent sparks dancing toward the stars.
Jay claimed a spot near one of the fires, mesmerized by the flames dancing against the darkening sky. Colleagues wandered between different activity stations—some playing beach volleyball, others wading in the gentle surf, and a few constructing elaborate sand sculptures.
Jay filled his plate with grilled fish and roasted potatoes, avoiding alcohol entirely. His stomach still rebelled at the thought of wine or cocktails, earning him sympathetic looks from colleagues.
"There's a sandcastle competition with actual prizes," Luc announced, dropping onto a nearby lounger. "Want to team up and embarrass ourselves publicly?"
"What kind of prizes?" Jay asked, intrigued despite his complete lack of sand-building experience.
"Spa treatments, wine selections."
Max overheard and decided to join their team, though his enthusiasm exceeded his architectural ability. Their construction efforts quickly devolved into a sad pile of sand with a few shells pressed into strategic locations.
"We're definitely not winning anything," Jay observed, watching a neighbouring team create an actual castle.
"The effort counts," Max replied cheerfully, adding another shell to their crumbling walls.
Their creation was indeed pitiful compared to the intricate fortresses taking shape around them, but Jay found the collaborative failure enjoyable. They abandoned the project in favour of food when their tower collapsed for the third time. The grilled seafood was exceptional. Jay worked through several varieties of fish while watching his colleagues gathering around fires for conversation.
As the evening progressed, Ian spent time with various senior partners and executives, conducting networking that seemed to happen automatically at company events. Jay was content to lounge by the fire, watching waves crash against the shore and listening to his teammates share stories.
Near the end of the evening, Ian came to Jay's fireside spot, sitting on an adjacent chair with a glass of whiskey. The alcohol had mellowed his rigidity slightly, though he maintained perfect posture even while relaxed. They sat watching flames dance and listening to the rhythmic sound of waves. Jay felt more content than he could remember being, the day's adventures leaving him peaceful.
Ian ate grilled vegetables observing the chaos. The firelight softened his angular features, and Jay watched Ian's profile when he thought it wouldn't be noticed.
"This has been an excellent day," Jay said eventually.
"You did well for a first-timer. Most people panic during their initial dive."
"Thanks for keeping me from drowning or floating to the surface accidentally."
"The equipment prevents most dramatic failures. Though staying calm underwater does require practice."
When the night fell for good, they walked back to their room together along the moonlit beach path. Ian moved slowly, though his control remained impressively intact.
"Bathroom's yours first," Jay offered once they were inside.
Ian nodded and disappeared while Jay stepped onto the balcony to watch the sea. The sound of running water was relaxing, and when Ian emerged twenty minutes later wearing only a bathrobe, Jay felt momentarily unbalanced by the domesticity of the scene.
The bathrobe was long and properly tied, but Ian's damp hair and casual posture made Jay acutely aware they were sharing sleeping quarters like an old married couple.
"Your turn," Ian said, sitting on his bed with a tablet.
Jay intended only to shower, but the enormous bathtub looked too inviting to resist. He filled it with hot water and bath products, letting the rich scents and silken water pamper him. The scents of lavender and lily filled the steamy air, and Jay lost track of time entirely.
When he finally emerged an hour later, Ian was propped against his pillows in silver silk pyjamas, reading news on his tablet.
"Even when you're drunk, you can't rest properly."
"Old habits," Ian replied without looking up.
The day's shared experiences had created an unusual sense of closeness, and Jay felt emboldened to step outside the safe topics they usually stuck to. "What do you even do for fun?"
"Nothing, really. Everything I do serves a purpose."
The honest answer was somehow both expected and sad. Jay got into his bed and pulled the covers up to his chest.
"What about you?" Ian asked, turning the question back.
"I read. Walk around parks. Sit in cafes."
Ian's mouth curved slightly. "That sounds almost as lonely as my own choice of free time activities."
Jay laughed softly. "Solitude is comfortable."
"On that, we both agree."
Jay knew fragments of Ian's history—the family ostracism, the betrayal that had shaped his isolation. He understood they'd both experienced things that had turned them into the guarded people they'd become.
The sense of connection felt deeper than proximity or shared circumstances, though Jay reminded himself it might be an illusion created by too much excitement.
Ian felt the same pull, the same recognition of similar wounds and defences. The urge to reach across the space between their beds was almost overwhelming, but he remained still, tablet balanced on his knees like armour against impulses he couldn't allow himself to acknowledge.
They eventually turned off the lights, listening to waves crash against the shore outside their window, each man acutely aware of the other.
Scene 5
Finale
Jay woke up before seven to find Ian already awake, propped against his pillows with a tablet in his hands.
"Morning," Jay whispered groggily.
"Good morning. Did you sleep well?"
Jay stretched and sat up. "Much better than yesterday. Let me make coffee this time. Fair's fair."
Ian accepted graciously and Jay headed to the kitchenette. Despite the early hour, neither seemed inclined to sleep longer.
They sat back on their respective beds with steaming mugs. Ian returned to his reading while Jay sprawled on his stomach, checking his phone and swinging his feet in the air. Jay had expected to feel self-conscious sharing space with Ian, but the opposite had happened. Ian didn't make him feel watched, but safe.
Ian stole glances over his tablet. Jay looked like a carefree teenager, unburdened by the weight he usually bore. These glimpses of spontaneity felt precious.
They eventually dressed and packed at a languid pace, neither eager to rush their final morning. Jay chose slightly more casual clothes—summer-weight slacks and a polo shirt. Ian maintained his usual standard with another perfectly tailored suit, though this one was lighter in both colour and fabric.
Only now did Jay notice that Ian's luggage was easily twice the size of his own single bag, which made sense given the variety of outfits Ian had produced over the weekend. Where Jay had brought selected basics, Ian clearly traveled with options for every conceivable situation.
Breakfast with the team was bittersweet, everyone aware the retreat was ending. The final day offered leisurely activities—massages, garden tours, art classes with Friday's featured artists, and various resort amenities.
Jay chose a massage straight from breakfast, his first ever spa treatment. The experience was revelatory, leaving him relaxed to a degree he hadn’t known was possible. He emerged feeling like he was floating, every muscle loose and warm.
He'd sat on the patio with an activities leaflet when Luc appeared, slightly frantic.
"We absolutely must do the treasure hunt. The prizes are incredible—tickets to an exclusive arthouse concert that are normally impossible to get. But we need four-person teams and we're running out of time."
Jay looked up from his pamphlet. "What kind of treasure hunt?"
"Problem-solving, riddles, physical challenges. Kim, Ela, Amy, and Zoe already registered as a team, and I can't find Max anywhere. We need two more people."
They eventually located Max by the pool, and after considerable persuasion, he agreed to participate. But Max had conditions.
"If we're doing this competitively, we need Ian," Max declared. "There are teams from other departments, and we can't let them show us up."
Finding Ian was easier than convincing him. "It's hardly appropriate for a CFO to take a spot in such an event," Ian protested when they cornered him.
"It's team building. We have to show these youngsters who runs things," Max insisted. 
Ian's resistance crumbled under Max's enthusiasm, and soon they were gathered at the starting line with seven other teams. Each group received a sealed packet of instructions, and they had exactly one hour to complete the course.
Jay had never participated in anything similar and felt immediately out of his depth. Max seemed equally confused by the cryptic clues, but Ian's demeanor sharpened the moment he opened their packet.
"This isn't my first team-building exercise," Ian explained, already deciphering the first riddle.
Luc was practically vibrating with excitement. "What do we do first?"
Ian solved the opening puzzle before the rest of them had finished reading it, then moved seamlessly to the next challenge. His capabilities was breathtaking—he absorbed each clue, processed the logic, and produced solutions almost instantly.
"Should we give the rest of you a chance to solve these?" Ian asked after handling three riddles in rapid succession.
"Absolutely not," Luc replied firmly. "We have to win this."
Jay followed Ian's lead like a devoted sidekick, impressed by skills he'd never suspected Ian possessed. When physical challenges required teamwork, Ian coordinated their efforts, his own conditioning compensating for Max's middle-aged limitations and Jay's mediocre fitness. Luc was surprisingly athletic, helping them complete tasks that demanded strength and agility.
They finished in record time, watching other teams struggle with puzzles Ian had solved in minutes. Amy's team came in fourth, stalled on a particularly complex challenge that required both mental and physical coordination.
"Unbelievable," Kim muttered when the results were announced, clutching his consolation prize of assorted chocolates and spa products. "Of course Ian turns out to be some kind of puzzle savant." 
Luc grinned shamelessly. "Pure skill and superior strategy."
The farewell lunch had a wistful atmosphere, everyone slightly melancholy about returning to normal life. Jay spent the remaining time on the beach, eventually joining Luc in the sea to splash around in the warm water.
When departure time arrived, they received gift bags of resort merchandise and packed containers of tropical food for the journey home. Jay's hair was still damp from his final swim, and he looked more youthful than Ian could remember seeing him—no tense shoulders, no carefully maintained polite expression, just comfortable contentment.
The bus ride back was quiet and lazy, everyone reclining in their seats and eating occasionally from the scattered containers. Even Ian abandoned his laptop, choosing instead to watch the landscape roll past his window.
Jay felt tired but deeply satisfied. He'd experienced more new things in three days than in months of regular life, and all of them had been first-class. More importantly, he'd seen different sides of his colleagues, particularly Ian, who'd revealed himself to be less tightly wound than Jay had imagined, almost relaxed at times. 
Jay dozed fitfully, waking to find they were entering familiar territory. The sight of downtown buildings created a feeling of homecoming, as if he were returning from a much longer journey than a few days. 
When they finally arrived at Northlight Financial Center, the contrast with their departure was stark. Instead of excited chatter and anticipation, people moved sluggishly, eager to reach their own beds. Luggage was retrieved with minimal fanfare, and goodbyes were exchanged with promises to share photos and plan future adventures. Jay waited for his suitcase, surprised by how reluctant he felt to leave the group. The retreat had created bonds that felt meaningful, and he wondered how those connections would translate back to the office environment. 
"Need a ride?" Ian asked.
"The metro's fine. I'm probably going in the opposite direction anyway." 
Ian hesitated, and Jay thought he might insist, but instead he simply nodded. 
"See you Monday, then." 
"See you Monday." 
Jay watched Ian disappear into the executive parking level before making his way to the metro station.  
Back in his apartment that evening, Jay unpacked immediately, doing laundry and returning items to their proper places. The routine was grounding after so much novelty. The studio felt smaller than he remembered, and somehow shabbier despite being exactly as he'd left it.  
He marveled at how comfortable and unthreatening the retreat had been. Even his hangover had been bearable thanks to Ian's unobtrusive care. The whole weekend had felt like a gift, leaving him energized.
In a burst of optimism, Jay made a decision that surprised him. He would attend his half-sister's graduation after all. Tomorrow he'd ask Ian for the day off, confident now that such a request wouldn't be viewed as presumptuous.
Meanwhile, Ian stood in his penthouse living room, studying the wall where he'd cleared space for the painting from Friday's exhibition. The piece Jay had admired would be delivered within days, though it didn't quite match his existing decor.
He chastised himself for the sentimental gesture even as he finalized the arrangement. It was a small concession, surely harmless in the long run. The painting would serve as a pleasant reminder of a successful company retreat, nothing more.
But as Ian prepared for bed, he found it increasingly difficult to silence the longing that had grown stronger with each passing day. The distance he'd maintained felt more precarious than ever.
Chapter 18: Artistic merits
Scene 1
After the retreat
The Monday morning was unlike anything Jay had experienced at Turner & Associates. The office buzzed with animated conversations and bursts of laughter. People clustered around computers, viewing the photo albums HR had posted overnight, and the casual atmosphere made everything feel more like a party than a workplace.
"Jay, come look at this. You can actually see the moment you stopped panicking and started enjoying yourself," Zoe called from her desk, where she'd pulled up footage from the diving session.
Jay walked over, grinning at the screen. "I look terrified in that first shot."
"You were terrified. But you got over it fast. Natural instincts, maybe?" Luc added, appearing with coffee.
"Hardly. I was just following Zoe's instructions. You mentioned there are places in the city where beginners can dive?" Jay turned to her.
"Absolutely. There's a fantastic pool facility about twenty minutes from here that offers certification courses. The instructors are excellent, and they have equipment rental. I could give you the details if you're interested," Zoe said, her face lit up.
"I think I am interested. It was incredible down there. The whole experience," Jay said, the words surprising him even as they left his mouth.
"Are we still talking about the diving? Because I'm pretty sure everyone saw Ian basically turn into a personal instructor for you," Kim wandered over with his own coffee, catching the end of their conversation.
"He was just being helpful," Jay replied, though he felt warmth creep up his neck.
"Ian doesn't do helpful for most people. Must have been your natural charm," Amy observed from her nearby desk.
Jay might have once taken the teasing as pointed, but now it felt good-natured. "More likely he didn't want to explain to HR why his assistant drowned during a company retreat."
Their laughter drew more people over, and soon they were all rehashing various moments from the weekend. The atmosphere remained loose through the morning, with work getting done but at a leisurely pace that acknowledged everyone's post-retreat mood.
Lunch extended well beyond the usual hour as conversations continued. Jay was at the center of one particularly animated discussion about the art exhibition.
"I still can't believe you'd never heard of mixed media installations. How is that even possible?" Ela said, shaking her head in mock despair.
"Very easily. I know absolutely nothing about art. I walked through that entire exhibition feeling completely lost," Jay replied with a self-deprecating smile.
"But you seemed engaged when we were there," Zoe pointed out.
"I was engaged. It was fascinating. I just had no idea what I was looking at or why it was supposed to be important."
"Art appreciation isn't innate. It's learned. You pick it up through exposure," Max chimed in.
"Or you don't. Some of us are hopeless cases," Jay said cheerfully.
Meanwhile, Luc had been practically bouncing in his seat throughout lunch, clearly bursting to share something. "I have to tell you all about these concert tickets. My girlfriend nearly fainted when I told her what we won."
"What's the big deal? It's just a concert, right?" Jay asked.
The table went quiet for a moment, then erupted in collective disbelief.
"Just a concert? Jay, these tickets are impossible to get. The artist only performs maybe ten times a year, always in tiny venues. People pay thousands on the secondary market," Kim said.
"I've literally never heard of them," Jay admitted.
"That's because they don't do commercial releases. Everything is limited edition, vinyl only, sold exclusively at performances. It's like this whole underground art scene thing," Amy explained.
Luc nodded enthusiastically. "The waiting list for tickets is supposedly years long. My girlfriend has been trying to get in since college."
Jay looked around the table, puzzled. "So what kind of music is it?"
"Experimental electronic with classical influences. Very atmospheric, very cerebral," Ela said.
"That sounds... not like something I'd understand," Jay said, tying to find diplomatic words.
This admission triggered another wave of laughter, but it felt warm. Jay was surprised by how comfortable he felt being the target of their amusement.
"We could educate you. Start with some basics, work up to the complex stuff," Ela suggested.
"I appreciate the offer, but I think I'll stick to what I know. Which apparently isn't much," Jay replied.
When lunch finally ended and everyone returned to the office, Jay felt a flutter of anxiety. He'd been putting off his conversation with Ian all morning, but it couldn't wait much longer. The graduation was only a few weeks away, and he needed to make arrangements. Jay knocked on the doorframe of Ian's office.
"Do you have a minute?"
Ian looked up, gesturing to the chair across from his desk. "Of course. What do you need?"
Jay sat down, suddenly feeling awkward. "I wanted to request a day off. It's for a family thing, my half-sister's graduation. In June."
He fumbled in his pocket for his phone, checking the date. "June twenty-fourth. It's a Friday. Assuming that's acceptable."
Ian looked at for a long moment, and Jay felt his confidence waver. Maybe this was presumptuous after all. Maybe he'd misread how things worked here.
"Where is the graduation?" Ian asked finally.
"My hometown. About four hours south. Just family obligations, you know. I haven't seen them in a while, and my mother..." Jay trailed off, realizing he was rambling.
"That's fine. Mark it on the calendar and notify HR. Do you need to borrow a company car for the trip?"
Jay was caught off guard. "A company car? I couldn't possibly—"
"Why not?"
"It just seems inappropriate. Using company resources for personal travel."
"It's standard procedure. Employees borrow company vehicles for personal needs regularly. There's a whole protocol for it."
"There is?"
"Check the employee handbook. Section twelve, I believe. Fleet vehicle policies."
Jay fidgeted in his chair, feeling out of his depth again. "I'm not the most confident driver, especially on highways."
"The cars are well-maintained and insured. If you're comfortable driving in the city, highway driving isn't much different."
"I'll consider it. Thank you for approving the time off."
"Of course. Family commitments are important."
Jay stood to leave, then paused. "Should I let you know about the car situation by a certain date?"
"A few days' notice is sufficient. The vehicles are usually available."
Walking back to his desk, Jay pulled out his phone and composed a quick text to his mother: "I'll be there for Ema's graduation. Driving down Friday morning, back Saturday."
Her response came within minutes: "Wonderful! Can't wait to see you. Ema will be so thrilled. We have so much to catch up on!"
Jay stared at the enthusiastic message, and he discovered he looked forward to the visit despite his reservations. Maybe this trip home wouldn't be as complicated as he'd imagined. Maybe, like everything else lately, it would turn out better than expected.
The afternoon passed quickly, work flowing smoothly after the relaxed morning. As people began packing up for the day, the retreat continued to provide conversation material. Someone had apparently started a group chat for sharing additional photos, and Jay was included without being asked.
"Check your phone," Zoe called over as she gathered her things. "I sent you that diving information."
Jay pulled up her message, finding a detailed list of facilities, instructors, and beginner programs. 
"This is incredibly helpful. Thank you."
"Let me know if you decide to try it. I'd be happy to go with you for moral support."
As the office emptied, Jay worked slightly later than usual, making up for the extended lunch and generally leisurely pace of the day. When he finally packed up, the building felt unusually comfortable.

Scene 2
Tickets
The retreat faded from conversation faster than Jay expected. By Wednesday, the diving stories and treasure hunt victories had been replaced entirely by intense discussions about the concert tickets. What started as casual mentions over coffee breaks had evolved into the primary topic at every lunch, and Jay was surprised by how invested everyone seemed.
"I still can't believe we actually won these," Luc said for what felt like the dozenth time as they sat in a new restaurant they'd discovered recently. "My girlfriend practically screamed when I told her. She's been following this artist since their first EP."
"How did you even hear about them?" Jay asked, still puzzled by the whole phenomenon.
"Underground music blogs, mostly. Word of mouth. The exclusivity is part of the appeal."
Kim, who Jay had never pegged as someone interested in experimental music, was equally enthusiastic. "The production quality is supposed to be incredible. They use custom sound systems, specially designed venues. It's more like an art installation than a traditional concert."
"Which explains why it's in a basement," Ela added with a grin. "Industrial chic is very on-brand for this scene."
Jay tried to imagine Ela, with her designer clothes and deluxe handbags, in what Luc had described as an underground club. The mental image didn't compute.
"We need to talk to Ian about his tickets," Kim said suddenly. "I mean, he's probably not planning to use them, right?"
"You can't just ask the CFO for his concert tickets," Amy protested.
"Why not? Worst case, he says no."
Max, who'd been quietly working through his curry, looked up. "Ian's reasonable about these things. If he's not interested, he'll probably just give them away."
The opportunity presented itself later that afternoon when Max encountered Ian at the coffee machine. Jay happened to be refilling his water bottle nearby and witnessed the entire exchange.
"Ian, about those concert tickets. Any chance you're planning to use them?"
"I hadn't really considered it. Why?"
"Well, Kim and Ela were hoping to go. And honestly, it seems like more of a group thing at this point."
"Kim and Ela want them?"
Max gestured toward the main office area, where Kim and Ela were huddled over Ela's computer, presumably looking at something related to the concert. "They're pretty excited about it."
Ian watched them for a moment, then turned back to Max. "They can have them."
"Just like that?"
"It's not really my type of event. Better that someone who'll appreciate it should go."
Kim and Ela's reaction when Max delivered the news was almost comical. Ela clapped her hands together, and Kim broke into a wide smile.
"This is perfect," Ela announced. "Kim knows all about the technical aspects, and I'm curious about the artistic vision. We'll complement each other's perspectives."
Jay watched the exchange with growing bemusement. "I had no idea you were into experimental music, Kim."
"There's a lot about me people don't know," Kim replied with a shrug. "I've been following electronic music production techniques for years. This artist is supposedly seriously challenging conventions."
By Friday's lunch the final arrangements had crystallized. Luc would attend with his girlfriend, Kim and Ela would use Ian's tickets, and Max had decided to give one of his tickets to Amy.
"My wife thinks it sounds pretentious," Max explained cheerfully. "And Amy's husband isn't the experimental music type either. So we figured, why not make it a company outing?"
Amy laughed. "He would rather spend the evening reorganizing our tax documents. He actively avoids anything he calls artistic."
That left Jay with his two tickets and no obvious companion. He'd been mulling over the situation all week, not particularly concerned but aware that everyone expected him to attend.
"Zoe, you should take my extra ticket," he offered as they waited for their food.
Zoe shook her head immediately. "Thanks, but no. I'm really more of an outdoors person. Give me a hiking trail or a diving reef over a basement club any day."
"Are you sure? Everyone else seems to think it's going to be amazing."
"I'm sure it will be, for people who are into that scene. But I've got plans anyway, mountain climbing weekend with some friends from my old job."
Everyone accepted her refusal. Jay wasn't particularly invested in finding a companion, and while the idea of experiencing something completely new had a certain appeal, he wasn't all convinced he even wanted to go. "I don't really have anyone to bring. If someone wants my tickets..."
"Absolutely not," Max interjected firmly. "This is basically a team event at this point. You have to come."
The conversation continued as their food arrived, and by the end of lunch, it had been decided that Jay's attendance was not optional. More surprisingly, Max had somehow roped Ian into the plan as well.
"It was his puzzle-solving that won us the tickets in the first place. It's only fair that he should experience the reward."
Jay wasn't present for that particular negotiation, but Ian's capitulation surprised everyone. By Friday afternoon, the plan was set: the entire team would attend, minus Zoe, plus Luc's girlfriend.
"It's next Friday at nine," Luc informed Jay as they packed up for the weekend. "The venue is called Substrate. It's in this industrial space in the art district. Very underground, very casual."
"What exactly does that mean?"
"Exposed pipes, concrete floors, dramatic lighting. The crowd will be pretty alternative, lots of black clothing, creative types, art students, music industry people."
Jay tried to imagine himself in such an environment. "What should I wear?"
"Whatever you're comfortable in. It's not like there's a dress code, but most people go for the scene look. Dark colours, interesting textures, that sort of thing."
"Scene look?"
Luc grinned. "You know, whatever aesthetic they're into. Goth, punk, avant-garde fashion, vintage counterculture stuff. It's part of the whole experience. Just avoid anything too corporate."
As Jay rode the metro home that evening, he thought about how much he'd learned about his teammates over the past week. Luc's girlfriend was apparently a serious music enthusiast with encyclopedic knowledge of underground artists. Kim had revealed an unexpected passion for sound engineering and music production. Ela, despite her polished appearance, was excited about experiencing something edgy and unconventional.
Max and Amy seemed more opportunistic about the whole thing, happy to try something new and spend time with colleagues outside the office. Their approach felt more relatable to Jay, who was curious but not particularly invested in the artistic merits of experimental electronic music.
Ian's decision to attend was the most puzzling. He'd seemed indifferent to the tickets when he'd given them to Kim and Ela, yet he'd eventually agreed to Max's pressure to join the group. Jay couldn't imagine Ian in an underground club, surrounded by art students, but then again, Ian had surprised him before.
Meanwhile, Ian sat in his penthouse that same evening, questioning his decision. He'd told himself it was a reasonable team-building exercise, a way to show support for the group dynamic. But he knew the real reason he'd agreed to go, and it had everything to do with his curiosity about Jay's reactions to new experiences.
He knew it was a dangerous indulgence. His resolve to maintain distance had been steadily eroding, and deliberately placing himself in a social situation with Jay was probably the opposite of prudent. But the rationalization came easily: it was a work-related event, attended by the entire team. Nothing inappropriate about supporting office morale.
Even as he made the argument to himself, Ian knew he was compromising his own rules. But the temptation to see Jay in yet another new environment was stronger than his caution.
Scene 3
Concert night
The week passed quickly, and Friday evening arrived before Jay had properly figured out what to wear. His casual wardrobe was limited and showing its age, but he decided against overthinking the situation. He'd considered buying something new but couldn't justify the expense for one event, especially when he had no idea what would be appropriate anyway.
He wore his least faded jeans, a plain black t-shirt, and his gym sneakers. Comfort seemed more important than whatever constituted "scene" fashion. Hopefully the alternative crowd would be forgiving of his shortcomings.
The team had arranged to meet at a sleek bar close to the venue, at eight o'clock. Jay arrived precisely on time to find Max and Amy already claiming a table, both dressed in what could generously be called business casual.
"You look sensible," Amy observed approvingly as Jay joined them. "I was worried I'd under-dressed."
"Drink?" Max offered, gesturing toward the bar. 
"Beer sounds good," Jay replied, happy for something to occupy his hands.
Luc appeared next with his girlfriend, who was undeniably gorgeous and in an extravagant dress that managed to be both elegant and edgy. She radiated excitement about the evening, but Jay couldn't help noticing the undercurrent of tension between them. 
Luc had turned himself into a walking advertisement for leather accessories, with an impressive array of belts, chains, and buckles adorning his black outfit.
"I told him the chains were excessive," his girlfriend announced to the table. "But does he listen? Never."
"You love my chains," Luc protested, sitting on a chair with a metallic clanking sound.
"I tolerate your chains. There's a difference."
Jay buried his face in his beer, trying to escape the awkwardness of witnessing their bickering. This was exactly the relationship dynamic that made him glad to be single.
Kim and Ela arrived moments later, both sporting dark eye makeup and wearing matching leather jackets over dramatically torn jeans that looked like they'd been coordinated down to the last zipper. The effect was so deliberately over-the-top that it had to be intentional.
"Please tell me this is some kind of inside joke," Jay said.
Ela grinned. "We decided if we were going to do this, we might as well commit to the aesthetic."
"You look like you're in a band," Amy observed with amusement.
"That's the idea," Kim replied, clearly pleased with the effect.
Luc studied Jay's outfit with theatrical concentration. "Normalcore," he announced finally. "Very cutting edge. The vibe is exactly what the scene needs right now."
Jay had no idea what normalcore meant, but he nodded as if it made perfect sense.
Ian appeared just as they were finishing their first round of drinks, and Jay had to suppress a double-take. Gone was the usual immaculate suit, replaced by what was clearly an expensive ensemble of dark slacks, a fitted black shirt and a jacket. The effect was striking. It was unmistakably designer, unmistakably elegant, and somehow managed to look both casual and formal simultaneously.
"Sorry I'm late," Ian said, claiming the remaining chair. "Traffic was heavier than expected."
Jay stole glances, trying not to be obvious about it. He made a point of not thinking about Ian's appearance, but this outfit made it impossible to ignore how attractive his boss actually was.
They finished their drinks amid increasingly animated conversation, with Luc's girlfriend providing a running commentary on the artist's previous performances, discography, and artistic evolution. Her enthusiasm was infectious, even if most of the technical details went over Jay's head.
When they finally made their way to Substrate, Jay trailed at the back of the group. Max and Ian had fallen into what sounded like a good-natured argument about municipal bond strategies, while the others chattered excitedly about what to expect from the performance.
The venue lived up to its underground reputation. They descended concrete steps into a converted basement space where exposed pipes and industrial lighting created exactly the aesthetic Luc had described. The crowd was smaller than Jay had expected, but every person seemed to embody some version of artistic expression, from elaborate makeup to avant-garde clothing combinations.
"There you are!" a familiar voice called out.
Jay turned to see Leo approaching with an elegantly dressed woman on his arm. Leo looked perfectly at home in the underground setting, which somehow wasn't surprising.
"I was hoping you'd all make it," Leo continued, beaming at the group. "Come on, I'll get you set up with good spots."
"What are you doing here?" Ian asked with suspicion.
"Same as you, I imagine." Leo's smile was entirely too innocent. "Though I have to admit, putting these prizes in the hunt was my idea. I thought we might enjoy something a bit different."
Ian's eyes narrowed. "How convenient."
"Isn't it?" Leo replied cheerfully, apparently oblivious to Ian's scepticism.
Ian's expression made it clear he wasn't buying this explanation, but Leo had already moved on, guiding them toward a cluster of plush couches near the performance area. Jay suspected Leo might actually own the venue, given how confidently he moved around the space and spoke to the staff.
"Best seats in the house," he announced. "Well, best couches. There aren't really seats."
They arranged themselves across several low couches with an excellent view of the makeshift stage in the center of the room, drinks in hand, as the performance space gradually filled with an audience that Jay estimated at maybe two hundred people. The exclusivity that everyone had mentioned was immediately apparent—this felt more like a private gathering than a commercial concert.
The performer was surrounded by an elaborate array of equipment that had Kim practically vibrating with excitement. "Look at that setup," he murmured to Ela. "That's a custom modular synthesizer."
The music was unlike anything Jay had experienced. It was aggressively experimental—layered electronic sounds that seemed to follow no recognizable structure, punctuated by periods of silence and sudden bursts of noise, accompanied by lighting effects that ranged from strobing intensity to near-complete darkness. The volume was punishing, and Jay felt a headache within the first fifteen minutes.
He glanced around at his colleagues. Luc and his girlfriend were swaying to rhythms Jay couldn't identify, while Kim and Ela sat with the focused attention of students analysing a complex theorem. Max and Amy looked politely interested but not particularly engaged.
Ian, seated nearby with his drink untouched, appeared to be barely enduring the experience.
Scene 4
Respite
After what felt like an eternity but was probably only thirty minutes, Jay decided he needed a break. He excused himself and made his way to the bar at the far end of the venue.
The noise level dropped once he got some distance from the speakers, and he gratefully ordered a whiskey despite knowing he'd hate the taste. Ian liked whiskey, though, which somehow made Jay's feelings about the drink warmer than they should be. The bartender poured a generous measure of something that smelled harsh and medicinal.
He was halfway through the glass, trying to look like someone who belonged in an underground club, when Ian appeared beside him.
"So I'm not the only one who had the same idea," Ian said, gesturing to the bartender. "Whiskey, please. Whatever you have that's actually drinkable."
The bartender produced a different bottle, and Ian sampled it cautiously. He looked disappointed.
"Well. It's better than the music," Ian said, sitting on the adjacent bar stool.
Jay felt a surge of relief at finding someone who shared his lack of enthusiasm. "I was beginning to think I was completely uncultured."
"High art is frequently indistinguishable from elaborate practical jokes," Ian replied.
"The noise was getting to me. I thought maybe some distance would help."
Ian drank and made a face. "This is terrible quality."
"I don't actually like whiskey at all. I just thought it seemed appropriate for the setting," Jay admitted.
"Appropriate for what? Punishing ourselves?"
Jay laughed, surprised by Ian's dry humour. "I guess high art is lost on me. I feel like I should be having some kind of profound experience, but mostly I just want the volume turned down."
"If it helps, I'm equally unimpressed. Though I suspect admitting that makes us philistines."
"What kind of music do you like?"
"Classical, mostly. Occupational hazard of the upbringing I had. I actually play violin."
Jay stared at him, momentarily speechless. "You play violin?"
"Played. I haven't touched it seriously in years."
"That's incredible. I should have guessed. You seem like someone who'd have classical training."
"Every privileged child's burden. My parents insisted on lessons from age five. I hated every minute of it as a child, wanted to play outside instead of practising scales," Ian said with a self-deprecating smile.
"But you kept playing?"
"Through college, yes. I was actually quite good, for a while. But it's not like riding a bicycle—without constant practice, the skills deteriorate rapidly. I play occasionally now, just to keep my fingers from forgetting completely, but I'm nowhere near performance level."
Jay listened with fascination, trying to imagine Ian as a child forced into music lessons, then as a young man skilled enough to perform publicly. It explained a lot about his composure.
"Do you miss it?"
"Sometimes. There's something meditative about playing well, when muscle memory takes over and you stop thinking about technique. But it takes years to reach that level, and more years to maintain it. What about you? What kind of music do you enjoy?"
"I don't really have preferences. I listen to whatever's on the radio, but I never pay attention to who's performing or what genre it is. I'm probably the least musical person you'll ever meet."
"I doubt that's true."
"You know what this reminds me of?" Jay said, gesturing toward the exposed pipes and concrete aesthetic. "The laundromat in my building's basement. Same industrial pipes, same dampness, same inexplicably loud mechanical noises. I've never understood why anyone would voluntarily spend time in an environment that feels like doing chores."
This observation sent Ian into laughter, a spontaneous reaction Jay had rarely witnessed from him. "That's remarkably apt. Though I suspect saying so would get us expelled from the artistic community."
"Our secret," Jay agreed solemnly.
They spent the remainder of the performance at the bar, occasionally commenting on the music and comparing their shared bewilderment at the venue's appeal. The conversation felt natural, more so than their office interactions ever managed, as if the bizarre environment had temporarily suspended their usual dynamics.
When the music finally ended and applause filled the space, they were joined by their colleagues, who appeared energized and slightly deaf.
"You missed the best part! The final movement was incredible," Kim exclaimed.
"Absolutely devastating. I'll never forgive myself," Jay replied with exaggerated sorrow.
"The regret will haunt me forever," Ian said, adopting a similarly theatrical expression.
Their mock despair sent Ela into fits of laughter, while Luc shook his head in disappointment. Leo, Jay noticed, was watching the exchange with a distinctly pleased expression.
"We're going to try to meet the artist. Kim and Ela want to discuss the technical aspects of the sound design," Luc's girlfriend announced.
"Count me in," Leo said, offering his arm to his companion.
As the group migrated toward the backstage area, Ian caught Leo's theatrical wink and rolled his eyes.
"Those two seem to have plans," Jay observed.
"Leo always has plans. Most of them involve other people's business," Ian replied.
Max and Amy excused themselves shortly after, declaring the evening "definitely an experience" with the diplomatic tone of people who'd fulfilled a social obligation.
"I think we've done our cultural duty. Amy's husband is picking us up in ten minutes," Max announced.
"Thank you for including me. Even if I didn't entirely understand what we just witnessed," Amy added.
Ian and Jay were alone again, slowly making their way toward the exit. The warm evening air felt like a blessing after hours in the stuffy basement.
"My driver is waiting around the corner. Can I give you a lift home?" Ian said.
Jay hesitated, but his usual reservations about imposing on Ian's politeness felt less pressing after their shared evening of cultural suffering. "That would be great, thank you."
The car ride was short—downtown traffic was minimal at this hour—but they managed to continue their discussion of whether artistic merit was inversely proportional to audience comprehension.
"So what's the verdict on avant-garde music?" Ian asked as they arrived at Jay's building.
"I think I'll stick to whatever's on the radio. Though I suppose it was educational."
"Educational is a diplomatic way to put it."
"Thank you for the ride. And for the company. The evening was much more tolerable with a fellow philistine."
"Anytime. Though next time, perhaps we could find an event that serves better whiskey."
Jay watched the car disappear into the night before heading upstairs to his apartment. The evening had been a disaster from a cultural perspective, but Ian's unexpected companionship had turned it into something almost enjoyable. There was something reassuring about discovering that his usually composed boss was just as bewildered by experimental music as he was.
As he prepared for bed, Jay thought that even the most challenging experiences seemed manageable with the right company.
Scene 5
Early June
The office reverberated with the aftermath of the concert for days afterward, though opinions remained sharply divided. Luc and Kim had formed an unexpected alliance, bonding over their shared marvel at what they'd witnessed and discussing nothing but experimental electronic music during every break.
"The way they manipulated the spatial acoustics was revolutionary," Kim explained to anyone within earshot.
"Exactly!" Luc agreed. "And the visual integration with the sound design created this completely immersive experience."
Max rolled his eyes whenever their conversations drifted in this direction. "Young people and their incomprehensible aesthetic preferences," he muttered to Amy during one particularly lengthy discussion about post-industrial soundscapes.
Jay agreed with Max's assessment, though he kept his opinions to himself. The concert had been memorable, but not for the reasons Luc and Kim seemed to think.
As May gave way to June, the weather changed from pleasantly warm to oppressively hot. The city sweltered under an intense heat wave, and Jay quickly discovered that his studio apartment's aging air conditioning unit was no match for the soaring temperatures. By contrast, the Turner & Associates offices maintained perfect climate control, making them infinitely more comfortable than anywhere else he could think of.
"I'll be staying late tonight," he mentioned to Ian on a particularly brutal Monday. "My apartment's basically uninhabitable until the sun goes down."
Ian accepted this explanation without question, probably because the heat was truly unbearable. The city's infrastructure seemed to be struggling under the extreme temperatures, with rolling blackouts affecting older buildings and the metro system running on reduced schedules.
Jay's late work days became more frequent, though the extended hours weren't really justified by increased workload. He simply found the office more pleasant than his overheated studio.
Ian, predictably, was always there during these late afternoons. His long hours weren't situational, they were routine. He rarely left before eight, often working well into the evening. Jay began to feel complicated emotions about this pattern, something that moved increasingly into the territory of worry as the days passed. 
"Don't you ever take breaks?" Jay asked one evening as they worked in the quiet office, the rest of the building mostly empty.
Ian looked up from his laptop, seeming puzzled by the question. "I take lunch breaks every day."
"For twenty minutes. That doesn't count."
"It's thirty minutes."
Jay let it drop, but the concern lingered.
Their time together in the mostly empty building felt more relaxed than their usual interactions, as if the circumstances had dissolved some invisible barrier between them.
"Any progress on those summaries?" Ian would ask.
"Almost finished. The heat makes it hard to concentrate."
"I can imagine. Take your time."
These conversations were brief but comfortable, both of them seeming to appreciate the other's company without feeling obligated to fill every silence with discussion.
Jay maintained his gym routine despite the weather, though he adjusted his schedule to accommodate the temperature. Tuesdays remained sacred, spent under Rus's patient guidance in the mercifully air-conditioned facility.
"You're getting stronger," Rus observed during a particularly challenging session. "Not dramatically, but consistently. Your form is much better."
"I don't really see much difference."
"Progress isn't always visible immediately. But your endurance has improved, and your posture is better throughout the day."
Jay felt pleased by the assessment. Physical fitness had never been a priority, but the gradual improvements were encouraging. He was even considering taking up Zoe's offer to try diving lessons, though he hadn't mentioned that possibility to anyone yet.
The weather also prompted another wardrobe overhaul. Jay's dark wool suits were torture in the current temperatures, forcing him to invest in lighter alternatives. He'd finally bit the bullet and purchased lighter options in muted beige and light gray.
While shopping, he also made another significant purchase, a second formal evening suit for upcoming company functions. He'd worn the same outfit to every elegant event since starting at Turner & Associates, and the prospect of arriving at July's quarterly party in identical attire felt embarrassing.
His closet had undergone yet another complete transformation. Gone were almost all of his old jeans and sweatshirts, replaced by an increasingly sophisticated collection of suits and dress shirts. He was running out of space, having to arrange things carefully to fit everything properly.
The apartment's limitations were becoming more apparent with each passing day. Jay had calculated his financial situation after nearly a year at Turner & Associates and realized he was in a position to consider a significant upgrade. He could afford a down payment on a one-bedroom apartment, and the monthly mortgage payments would be similar to his current rent.
He'd started browsing listings during his late afternoon hours in the office, looking for places in quiet neighbourhoods slightly closer to the financial district. It wasn't urgent, but the idea of having proper closet space and reliable air conditioning was increasingly appealing.
"Looking at real estate?" Ian asked one evening, noticing Jay's computer screen as he passed by.
"Just browsing. My current place is getting a bit cramped."
Ian paused, glancing at the listings Jay had pulled up. "Those are good neighborhoods. Safe, convenient to the office."
"That's what I was thinking. Though I'm not in any particular hurry."
"Take your time with it. Buying property is a big decision."
Jay appreciated the advice, even though he suspected Ian spoke from experience Jay couldn't begin to imagine. The price ranges Ian probably considered were likely several times what Jay was contemplating.
Meanwhile, his upcoming trip home required preparation of a different sort. Jay had submitted the paperwork for borrowing a company car, though the prospect of driving four hours on unfamiliar highways made him nervous enough to book driving lessons.
"I need to brush up on my skills," he explained to the driving instructor "It's been a while, and I have an important trip coming up."
After three sessions, Jay felt more at ease. Highway driving wasn't as intimidating as he'd remembered, and the instructor was patient with her cautious approach to highway merging and parallel parking.
"You're actually a competent driver," she assured him. "You just need to trust your instincts more. The fundamentals are solid."
The heat continued unabated, making the office's climate control feel increasingly precious. Jay's extended work days became an established pattern, and being alone with Ian during these evening hours felt natural. They'd developed a rhythm of parallel productivity, each focused on their respective tasks but comfortable sharing the space.
It was a small thing, but it represented how much had changed since Jay's anxious first days at Turner & Associates. He no longer felt like an intruder in Ian's domain, and Ian no longer seemed to view him as a potential threat to be monitored.
As the month progressed toward Ema's graduation, Jay felt more prepared for the challenges ahead, both the immediate trip home and the longer-term decisions about his living situation. The heat might be oppressive, but everything else in his life seemed to be moving in positive directions.
Chapter 19: Family
Scene 1
Mundane tasks
June traditionally marked the beginning of the company's slower season. With most major projects completed before summer and new initiatives postponed until autumn, the office operated at a more leisurely pace. Jay's colleagues spent lunch breaks discussing vacation plans, senior partners left early for weekend trips, and the general atmosphere was relaxed.
For Jay, who had no vacation plans beyond visiting his family for his half-sister's graduation, the quieter schedule created opportunities to tackle projects he had never found time to address during busier periods.
The heatwave had also reignited the old lunch debate with fresh urgency. The team's restaurant rotation faced harsh scrutiny based on air conditioning quality.
"I'm not walking fifteen minutes in this heat just for mediocre pasta," Amy declared during Tuesday's lunch planning session.
"The seafood place has excellent cooling. Even if their service has gotten slower lately." Ela suggested. 
Kim, notorious for prioritizing interesting food over convenience, looked pained as several of his favourite establishments were eliminated from consideration due to inadequate climate control. "The hotpot place makes the best pickled cabbage in the district, but their AC sounds like a dying helicopter."
"Proper cooling beats culinary adventure when it's forty degrees outside," Max replied.
Kim grudgingly agreed that surviving the heat took precedence over gastronomic exploration.
When most of the team departed by six o'clock, Jay remained at his workstation to reorganize the department's filing system. The cabinets had been sorted chronologically for years—a system that made sense when Turner & Associates handled fewer clients but had become increasingly unwieldy as their business expanded.
Ian had mentioned the need for alphabetical reorganization months earlier, describing it as "non-urgent but eventually necessary." June's calm provided the perfect opportunity to tackle such administrative improvements.
Jay pulled files from their current locations, sorted them by client name, and created new folder tabs. The work required little creative energy, making it ideal for the languid summer evenings when his mind felt pleasantly unfocused.
"Working on the filing project?" Ian asked, emerging from his office.
"Almost finished with the G section. Should have the whole system converted by Friday," Jay replied, looking up from his neat piles of documents.
Ian approached the filing cabinets to examine Jay's progress. The new organization was immediately apparent—clear labels, easy accessibility for future reference.
"This looks excellent. Much more practical than what we had before."
"The old system probably made sense when you had twenty clients instead of two hundred," Jay said, and paused as he realized the comment might come across as presumptuous.
"It made sense when I first started here. Less effective once we began hiring groups of people to manage the growing workload. Personally, I preferred the chronological order, but I was in the minority."
The gentle self-deprecation surprised Jay, who was used to Ian's more formal way of speaking. "So you’re saying you’ve sacrificed your own preference for the greater good?"
"I'm saying alphabetical order is superior to my personal filing instincts." Ian replied with obvious amusement.
Jay returned to his sorting with a smile, enjoying the unexpected lightness in their exchange. The banter felt natural, as if some invisible barrier had finally dissolved completely.
Later that week, Jay had ventured to the nearby park in the afternoon, discovered during his anxious first month at Turner & Associates. The small green space included a gourmet ice cream cart that served artisanal flavours created for people with adventurous tastes. After studying the handwritten menu board, he selected parsnip ice cream—an unusual choice that intrigued him precisely because it seemed so unexpected.
The flavour was interesting, with sweetness balanced by earthy undertones that challenged his preconceptions about frozen desserts. Jay ate it slowly on a park bench, watching office workers seek shade under the limited tree cover.
When he finally walked back to Northlight Financial Center, the contrast between the oppressive outdoor heat and the building's climate control felt like entering a sanctuary. The pleasure of that transition made him appreciate the comfort he was returning to even more.
These small explorations of the neighbourhood during quieter periods had become part of Jay's expanded routine. With fewer urgent tasks demanding immediate attention, he allowed himself brief escapes that would have been impossible during the intense winter months.
His summer activities extended beyond filing systems and visiting local ice cream vendors. Jay typically completed all tasks during evening hours, processing emails as they arrived and ensuring that nothing awaited his attention the following morning. That left his morning hours free for other, less pressing matters, like learning how the administrative departments functioned, consulting with staff about office supply purchases and kitchen inventory, understanding how the archives and print room operated.
His explorations remained deliberately unobtrusive—he made sure to schedule visits during natural breaks in departmental workflows and avoided areas containing sensitive information. The goal was understanding how Turner & Associates functioned as an integrated system beyond just his immediate sphere of responsibility.
Jay had also familiarized himself with other departments' client portfolios, reading case summaries and learning about investment strategies that fell outside his direct responsibilities. The knowledge wasn't immediately useful, but it provided context that made him more effective when handling cross-departmental communications.
During quieter moments of the day, Jay studied the advanced prognostic models that Max and Amy typically designed and maintained. The mathematical frameworks challenged his comprehension limits, but persistent effort gradually revealed the elegant logic underlying their complexity. He took notes, flagging areas for future research.
He had acquired a nice leather-bound notebook specifically to organize his growing knowledge about the firm’s practical operations. Relying on loose pads and scattered post-its had started to become troublesome, and he needed a better system. One section of the notebook was dedicated to the intricacies of the models, another detailed the specific responsibilities assigned to each team member. At this time, he focused particularly on hounding Kim for details, since Kim’s annual absence was rarely covered properly due to the wide range of duties he handled.
The economics textbook he had brought to the office earlier now showed signs of serious study, with pages marked with additional notes. Jay had supplemented it with a more challenging text on international finance theory, working through complex analyses during long evenings.
As the Friday evening stretched toward eight o'clock, Jay completed his filing project. Ian was in his office and remained visible through his open door, apparently in no hurry to leave despite having no pressing deadlines.
"All finished. Future researchers will be able to locate materials without developing new theories about the filing philosophy," Jay announced.
"Your organizational skills continue to impress me. Though I have to ask—don't you have better ways to spend your evenings than reorganizing inherited filing disasters?"
"Staying here until the temperature drops feels more pleasant than slowly melting at home. And I like having projects to work on."
Jay returned to his workstation and opened his advanced economics textbook to a chapter on currency stabilization mechanisms. Ian looked up from his work and caught Jay's glance, offering a brief smile that Jay returned automatically. Such moments of connection had become more frequent since the retreat, small acknowledgements of their shared evenings that felt personal.
"Good chapter?" Ian asked.
"Challenging but interesting. International currency policy turns out to be more complex than I originally understood."
When they finally headed for the exit, the building's lobby was nearly empty except for security staff preparing for the overnight shift. Outside, the evening heat remained oppressive despite the late hour, creating visible waves of distortion above the pavement.
"See you on Monday," Jay said as they parted ways.
"Have a good evening. Try to stay cool."
The filing project was complete, but Jay had already identified other administrative improvements that could benefit from attention during the next week. His expanded understanding of the company's operations revealed numerous opportunities for optimization that nobody else had time to pursue.
Scene 2
The Family Visit
Jay picked up the company car Thursday evening, planning to leave early Friday morning for Ema's graduation. He checked the parking space number twice before accepting what he was seeing. In his designated spot sat what could only be described as a limousine. He checked the license plate against his paperwork, then pressed the key fob. The car's lights flashed in response, leaving no room for doubt.
Jay stared at the pristine interior, the leather seats, the glowing dashboard. In retrospect, he should have expected this. Turner & Associates wasn't the type of company to maintain a fleet of economy cars. But the reality of driving something worth more than his apartment was intimidating.
He drove it home with extreme caution, terrified about leaving it parked on the street overnight. Fortunately, his neighborhood was safe, and he found a spot directly under a streetlight where he could see it from his window.
Jay spent the evening on meticulous preparation. He packed his suitcase, laid out everything he'd need, and prepared food for the morning. The graduation ceremony started at two, which meant leaving by eight to account for traffic and arrival time.
Choosing an outfit had been surprisingly complicated. His closet was now full of expensive clothing, but most of it was business wear. He no longer owned casual clothes appropriate for a family gathering, but showing up in a suit seemed too formal for his siblings' middle school graduation.
Eventually he'd decided on the designer pieces from his winter shopping emergency at Hathaway's that he never worn since purchasing them. The combination was more extravagant than anything he'd owned a year ago, but at least it wasn't obviously corporate. 
He could have chosen some of the resort casual wear he'd recently bought, comfortable pieces that would have been perfectly appropriate for a family gathering. But those exquisite items were too expensive to leave hanging in his closet unused, so he figured this was a good enough occasion to wear them. A family function seemed safe enough—he didn't need to worry about attracting unwanted attention. If he was going to wear these beautiful pieces anywhere, this was as good an opportunity as any.
He'd also visited his usual hairdresser for a fresh cut, the same stylist who prepared him for company events. Looking in the mirror Friday morning, he had to admit the overall effect was quite polished.
The drive started smoothly, but Jay quickly discovered he'd underestimated Friday morning traffic during summer. Cars moved at a crawl through the city, and what should have been a four-hour journey threatened to stretch much longer. By ten-thirty, he was texting his mother that he'd go straight to the school instead of stopping at home first. Speeding was obviously out of the question.
He arrived at Ema's school with minutes to spare, parking the deluxe sedan among modest family cars and immediately regretting his choice of vehicle. The contrast was stark. His car looked like it belonged to a celebrity, not someone attending family function.
The effect on Ema's classmates was immediate and dramatic. As Jay walked toward the school entrance, he heard whispers and saw phones being pulled out for photos. He felt conspicuous, and it made him deeply uncomfortable.
"Jay!" Ema's voice cut through the crowd, and suddenly she was running toward him.
"Hey. Congratulations," he said, accepting her enthusiastic hug.
"Oh my God, you look amazing! Is that your car? That's your car, isn't it? This is so cool!"
Before Jay could explain that it was a company vehicle, Ema was dragging him toward her friends, who had clustered nearby with phones ready.
"This is my brother Jay," she announced proudly. "He works in high finance in the city. He's basically like a investment banker or something."
Jay tried to correct her, but she was already posing for selfies and posting to social media with captions about her "successful big city brother." 
The graduation ceremony proceeded smoothly. Ema's cheerleading performance was energetic and well-executed, and Jay applauded enthusiastically from his seat with the family. But even during the formal proceedings, he noticed other parents glancing in his direction, clearly curious about the well-dressed young man who'd arrived in the limousine.
Back at the house for the celebratory dinner, Jay completely overshadowed Ema's actual achievement. She asked questions about the financial world, clearly imagining his job as something far more glamorous than it actually was. Even her performance, which she'd been so proud of earlier, became a secondary topic of conversation.
"Do you work with like, really rich people?" she asked over dessert.
"Sometimes, but I'm really just-"
"That's so cool! Do you have to wear suits every day? Is your office in one of those huge skyscrapers?"
His attempts to downplay his role were futile, especially after he presented gifts to his siblings—vouchers to stores he thought they'd enjoy, meant to mark the end of the school year and serve as birthday presents. Their excitement over the amounts only reinforced their perception of his success. 
"You didn't have to do this," his mother said quietly, but Jay could see she was pleased by his generosity toward the other children.
"I wanted to," Jay replied honestly. "It's not often I get to celebrate with everyone."
Tim was fascinated by the car. "Can we see the inside? Does it have like, a sound system?"
Even Ari, usually shy, was drawn into the excitement, asking if Jay had his own office and whether he'd ever been on television.
Jay's mother watched the proceedings with obvious pride, though she seemed content to let her younger children monopolize his attention. The other relatives who'd come for the graduation treated him with a deference that felt strange and unearned.
Saturday was even more overwhelming. Ema had apparently made promises to her friends, because she appeared at breakfast with a detailed plan for Jay to drive them around the town and accompany them shopping.
"I can't just drive a company car around for entertainment," Jay protested.
"But you said it was okay to use for personal needs!"
"For necessary personal needs. Not joyrides."
"Please? My friends will die if they don't get to ride in it. And you never come home anyway."
The guilt trip worked, largely because Jay couldn't argue with the accusation about never visiting.
"It's not actually a limo," he tried to explain as Ema and three friends piled into the back seat.
"It's close enough," Ema replied dismissively. "My friends think you're basically like those investment bankers in movies."
They spent the morning at a shopping center where Ema used her cosmetics voucher, testing products and consulting with her friends about color choices. Jay followed at a distance, mostly trying to blend into the background.
Lunch at a nice restaurant impressed the teenagers even more, especially when Jay insisted on paying despite their halfhearted protests about using their allowances.
"So you don't make deals worth millions every day?" one of Ema's friends asked, sounding disappointed.
"No, I mostly organize meetings and handle correspondence."
"But you work with people who make such deals?"
"Well, yes, but-"
"That's so cool!"
The afternoon was devoted to his brothers' shopping expeditions. Ari's toy store adventure was relatively straightforward, though he kept asking Jay's opinion about various electronic games and building sets. Tim's outdoor equipment shopping was more complex, involving lengthy discussions about sleeping bag temperature ratings and backpack features.
Between the shopping trips and general driving around, Jay committed to staying until Sunday instead of leaving Saturday evening as originally planned. The siblings had claimed so much of his attention that he'd barely interacted with the other relatives who'd come for the celebration, including several aunts and uncles he hadn't seen in years.
He'd slept cramped in Ari's narrow bed while Ari bunked with their parents, since the house was full of visiting relatives. The accommodations were uncomfortable, but Jay didn't mind. It felt familiar and comforting.
When he finally prepared to leave Sunday afternoon, his mother walked him to the car, holding a small wrapped package.
"Your birthday's coming up, and I know you won't be able to visit again soon," she said, pressing the gift into his hands. "I'm so proud of what you've accomplished, Jay. You've really made something of yourself in the city."
"Mom, I'm just an assistant. It's not as impressive as everyone thinks."
She smiled, the same patient expression she'd worn when he was small and trying to deflect praise. "You look successful, honey. Whatever you're doing, it's working for you."
Jay accepted the gift and her assessment, knowing that further protests would be futile. In their eyes, he'd transformed from a struggling young man into someone worthy of admiration, and perhaps that wasn't entirely wrong.
The drive home was peaceful, with light Sunday traffic making for an easy journey. Jay felt drained but happy. The weekend had been tiring, but seeing his family's pride and excitement had been worth the exhaustion.
Back in his studio, Jay unpacked his mother's gift. Inside was a collection of photos from the weekend—candid shots of him with his siblings, including several where Ema and the boys were literally hanging off his arms, all of them grinning broadly. There was also a package of rare spices, the kind that reminded him of his grandfather and had always fascinated him, even though his cooking skills remained basic.
Looking at the photos, Jay had to admit he looked happy despite the chaos of the weekend. The designer clothes created an image of success that wasn't entirely false, even if it wasn't the whole truth either. His siblings' obvious affection and pride in his achievements made him feel warm inside.
The spices were a thoughtful touch that showed his mother still remembered small details about his preferences, even after years of limited contact.
The visit had been more intense than expected, but it had also been surprisingly affirming. Maybe he really had made it further than he'd realized.
Scene 3
Photos
Jay selected the best photo from his mother's collection and placed it in a discreet corner of his desk Monday morning. The image captured a perfect moment, him looking great in his designer clothes, with Ema hanging from one arm while he patted Ari's hair with his free hand, and Tim lurking behind him, already taller than Jay despite being the younger brother. Everyone was smiling, and the photo radiated uncomplicated joy that made good memories.
When Ian arrived and spotted the new addition to Jay's workspace, he paused at Jay's desk.
"How was the graduation?"
"Really good. Ema was thrilled. She performed with the cheerleading squad, and everything went well. The whole family was there, aunts, uncles, cousins. It was quite the production."
"And your siblings? How are they adjusting to having their successful older brother visit?"
The question felt specific, but Jay answered readily. "They were excited. Maybe a bit too excited. I ended up staying an extra day because they wanted to show me off to their friends."
"Show you off?"
Jay felt heat creep up his neck. "The car made quite an impression. And apparently I look more successful than I feel. Ema spent the entire weekend bragging to her friends about her brother in finance."
"I see. That must have been gratifying."
"Embarrassing, mostly. But nice, I suppose."
Ian's questions continued beyond polite inquiry. "How was he drive? No problems with the vehicle? Where did you stay overnight?"
Jay happily narrated the weekend's events, describing the family dinner and his siblings' excitement about their gifts. Ian listened patiently, though Jay began to feel slightly sheepish about monopolizing his boss's time with personal stories.
"I'm probably talking too much," Jay said eventually. "I know you have work to get to."
"It's fine. I'm glad the visit went well."
Throughout the morning, Jay's colleagues stopped by his desk to admire the family photo. The image sparked conversations about summer plans and upcoming vacations, which gradually became the dominant topic around the office.
"What about you, Jay? Any holiday plans?" Amy asked during their coffee break.
"Not really. I'll probably take time off when Ian does," Jay said.
This prompted general laughter from the group.
"Ian hasn't taken a real vacation in three years. The last time was practically forced by Turner senior when he threatened to lock Ian out of the building," Max informed him.
"Three years?" Jay repeated, feeling that familiar worry about Ian's work habits.
"He's hopeless. We've all given up trying to convince him to take breaks," Ela added.
Jay made a mental note to revisit this topic later, though he wasn't sure what he could possibly do to influence Ian's vacation schedule.
That afternoon, his phone rang with Ema's name appearing on the screen.
"Jay! You have to send me tons of photos from your office and the city. My friends are obsessed with your whole finance life now."
"I can send some photos, but I don't really take many pictures at work."
"Then start! And you absolutely need to get social media so I can tag you in things. It's so embarrassing that my successful older brother doesn't even have an account."
Jay felt uncomfortable at the suggestion. "I've never had social media accounts. I wouldn't know what to do with them."
"Everyone has social media, Jay. How do you even exist without it?"
"Quite peacefully."
After some negotiation, he agreed to take more photos but held firm on the social media issue. Ema wasn't entirely satisfied, but accepted the compromise.
Tuesday morning, Jay arrived at seven-thirty to find the office empty. This seemed like the perfect opportunity to attempt the photography Ema had demanded. He started with awkward selfies that showed nothing useful, then tried setting up his phone with a makeshift timer, but the results were terrible.
He was crouched behind his desk, trying to position his phone against a stack of books, when he heard footsteps. Ian appeared earlier than usual, taking in the scene with what looked like alarm.
"What are you doing?"
"I was just... my sister wanted photos of the office. Is that not allowed? I didn't think about whether it might be inappropriate..." Jay stammered, suddenly worried he'd broken some rule about photographing company premises.
He held up his phone awkwardly, as if to show evidence of his innocent intentions. The camera roll displayed his terrible attempts at office photography—blurry shots of his desk, an accidental close-up of the ceiling, and one particularly unfortunate image of his chin.
"These are quite possibly the worst photos I've ever seen," Ian said, and Jay caught the hint of suppressed laughter in his voice.
"I know. I have no idea what I'm doing."
"Sit down. I'll take proper photos."
"You don't have to do that."
"Apparently I do, unless you want to send your sister evidence that you work in a blurry, incomprehensible dimension."
Ian's photography skills were immediately apparent. He composed shots that made Jay's workspace look impressive, captured the office's elegant atmosphere, and even managed a few images that showed the city view from their floor.
"One more," Ian said, then surprised Jay by positioning himself in the frame for a selfie. "Your sister will want proof that you have colleagues."
The selfie turned out surprisingly well, both of them looking poised, the office's sophisticated backdrop clearly visible. Jay stared at the image with delight.
"This is perfect. Thank you so much for helping with this."
"It's nothing."
Jay looked at Ian's other photos, shaking his head in amazement. "How are you good at everything?"
"I'm not good at everything."
"Name one thing you're not good at."
Ian paused, seeming to consider seriously. "I can't think of anything immediately."
Jay threw him an exaggerated look of despair. "It's not fair. Some of us have to work at being competent."
"I'm sure you have talents I lack."
"Like what?"
"You're much better at making people comfortable. That's not a skill I possess naturally."
The compliment caught Jay off guard, and he felt warmth spread through his chest. "Thank you. And thank you for helping with the photos. Ema's going to be thrilled."
"You're welcome."
The rest of the morning proceeded normally, but Jay treasured the unexpected selfie with Ian. He had other photos of them together from company events, but those felt impersonal, formal shots taken by photographers at business functions. This candid image felt different.
He sent Ema the best photos as promised, receiving an immediate barrage of enthusiastic responses about the office's glamour and how impressive everything looked. But privately, Jay kept returning to the selfie, wondering if it would be presumptuous to print it and put it on his refrigerator alongside the family photo from graduation weekend.
Meanwhile, Ian sat at his desk feeling deeply unsettled by his own behavior. The moment when he'd first seen Jay with the camera had triggered an immediate spike of paranoia, memories of Sam Connelly's corporate espionage attempts flooding back. But Jay's obviously innocent photo attempts had quickly dissolved those fears, leaving Ian feeling guilty for doubting him even momentarily.
Ian forced himself to confront an uncomfortable realization: he was becoming more concerned about accidentally hurting Jay than about protecting himself. The shift in priorities should have alarmed him, but instead it felt inevitable, as if he'd been moving toward this point without conscious recognition.
More troubling was his willingness to help with the photography. He was actively participating in Jay's personal life, making himself available far beyond what supervisory duties required.
He was in dangerous territory, and he knew it. But every interaction with Jay made it harder to maintain the emotional distance he'd once considered essential for his own safety.
Jay's happiness about the photos, his affection for his family, his concern about office policies, everything about him showed authenticity that Ian found increasingly difficult to question. And his own responses to Jay were becoming harder to rationalize.
Scene 4
Holiday season
The leisurely pace of June vanished overnight as the second quarter drew to its official close. July started with the urgency of quarterly reporting season, turning Turner & Associates into a finely tuned machine operating at maximum capacity.
Jay had grown accustomed to the extended evening hours, but the expanded workload felt jarring after weeks of self-directed projects. His role during quarterly reporting remained peripheral to the actual document creation, but his supporting responsibilities expanded during these intensive periods. He handled formatting for multiple document types, managed extensive copy-paste operations, and proofread materials that would eventually reach regulatory authorities and clients.
The compliance and audit departments seemed particularly active this quarter, their increased scrutiny apparently related to recent regulatory changes that Jay didn't fully understand but whose effects rippled through every aspect of their reporting process. His days filled with correspondence between various departments, scheduling meetings, and ensuring that documentation met increasingly specific requirements.
"New regulations always create chaos for the first few cycles. Everyone interprets requirements slightly differently until precedent gets established," Max explained.
Jay nodded while mentally adding another item to his growing list of processes to research once the immediate crisis passed. The regulatory landscape remained largely mysterious to him, but each quarterly cycle revealed more about how external requirements shaped their internal operations.
The suspended lunch trips felt less painful given the oppressive heat outside. Nobody complained about living on takeout when the alternative involved venturing into temperatures that made short walks feel like endurance tests. The office kitchen received heavy use as everyone adapted to eating meals that could be delivered directly to their climate-controlled sanctuary.
Amid the frenzy of quarterly reporting, Jay received his second quarterly bonus. The bank transfer notification appeared in his account, leaving Jay once again staring at his bank statement in disbelief. The company's compensation structure continued to remain needlessly opaque.
The HR documentation remained as cryptic as ever—a lengthy list of components beyond his base salary that included items like "CFO Desk Premium," "Monthly Operations Supplement," and "Discretionary Quarterly Float." His previous job had straightforward simplicity—base salary plus occasional small bonuses tied to specific performance metrics. Turner & Associates operated according to more complex principles.
Jay had initially assumed the bonuses might be temporary or conditional, but their consistent appearance indicated they were integral to the company's compensation philosophy. The amounts were big enough to impact his financial stability. He didn't even want to contemplate the annual bonuses, given that last year's had been large enough to completely revolutionize his understanding of personal finance and fund his designer wardrobe experiments.
"The bonus system shows Leo's approach to employee retention. He believes in paying well enough that people don't want to leave," Amy had explained during a conversation. 
The approach seemed to work effectively. Jay certainly had no desire to leave Turner & Associates, though his motivation extended far beyond financial considerations.
As the chaotic first week finally concluded, the holiday season began in earnest, and the office began to empty in waves. Kim and Ela had suspiciously coordinated their schedules to take two weeks off at the same time, which nobody mentioned directly but everyone noticed.
The reduced staffing meant that remaining team members needed to absorb additional responsibilities, particularly in areas where specialized knowledge was required. Jay covered duties he had never handled independently, armed with the detailed notes Kim had provided during June's slower period.
"Database maintenance isn't complicated once you understand the method. But if something goes wrong, don't try to fix it yourself. Call the IT department immediately,"  Kim had explained during one of their June training sessions.
Jay's notebook contained five pages of instructions for handling Kim's more straightforward tasks, complete with contact information for various specialists and step-by-step procedures for common problems. The preparation was invaluable as Jay handled duties that would have previously required IT intervention.
The additional workload felt manageable, partly because of Kim's preparation and partly because Jay had grown more comfortable with expanding his role when circumstances demanded flexibility. He had learned prepare solutions in advance and escalate issues appropriately when they exceeded his expertise.
The rest of the team had various leave scheduled throughout the upcoming two months, creating the seasonal coverage challenges that Jay was already anticipating. Max was planning another of his eccentric adventures to somewhere hot and unpopular, prompting a chorus of warnings about exotic foods and extended hospital stays.
"Remember last year when you disappeared for two months after eating that fish thing?" Amy reminded him during one of their morning coffee breaks.
"It was a valuable cultural experience," Max replied.
"It was food poisoning that nearly required medical evacuation."
"I was only unreachable for three weeks. And the food poisoning was completely unrelated to my travel choices."
"You couldn't walk properly for a month," Amy reminded him.
"Character building," Max replied cheerfully.
Luc had organized a backpacking trip with his girlfriend for August, while Amy's family vacation with her husband and daughters was scheduled for later in July. Zoe's two-week scuba diving expedition generated considerable excitement from Jay, who kept asking her with questions about locations, certification requirements, and equipment.
"You should really try those beginner classes I mentioned. You seemed to enjoy it at the retreat," Zoe said.
"I'm seriously considering it." 
The vacation discussions inevitably led to Ian calling Jay into his office later that week.
"You haven't submitted your leave request yet," Ian observed, consulting a staffing calendar.
"I'll take my leave when you do," Jay replied matter-of-factly.
Ian looked up sharply. "That's not how vacation scheduling works."
"I’m your assistant. It's how mine works."
"Jay, you need to take time off. It's not optional."
"I agree completely. We both need to take time off."
"I don't take extended vacations."
"I know. That's why I'm not taking mine either."
"That's... manipulative."
"Maybe a little. I'm not trying to be difficult. I just think we both need breaks, and if my schedule depends on yours, perhaps you'll reconsider your approach to time off."
Ian was caught between irritation and grudging respect for Jay's strategy. "You can't just refuse to take vacation because I don't."
"I'm not refusing. I'm scheduling mine to coincide with yours."
"I'm not planning any time off."
"Then neither am I."
They reached an impasse that left Ian clearly frustrated but unwilling to directly order Jay to submit vacation requests. Jay could see him calculating options and finding them all unsatisfactory.
"We'll revisit this," Ian said finally.
"Of course."
Jay left the meeting feeling slightly guilty but confident that his point had been made. Ian's work habits were concerning, and if a little strategic stubbornness could prompt him to take a break, the ends justified the means.
The holiday season was just beginning, and Jay was curious to see whether his gambit would work. Either Ian would order him to take vacation anyway, or he would finally be forced to consider his own need for rest and recovery.
Jay was committed to his position now. Ian's well-being felt more important than his own desire for a beach holiday, and if his mild manipulation succeeded in getting Ian to take care of himself, the gamble would be worth it.

Scene 5
Ambience
The quarterly party provided a welcome distraction from office realities. Turner & Associates had opted for an outdoor evening event to accommodate the summer weather, complete with elegant torches creating atmospheric lighting around the garden venue. String lights draped between architectural elements created constellations against the dusky sky, turning the place into something magical.
 Jay wore his new summer suit in light earthy tones, feeling pleasantly unremarkable for once. The muted colours made him blend into the background, which improved his mood. He stood near the bar, holding a glass of wine and observing the smaller-than-usual gathering. The holiday season had claimed several team members—Kim and Ela absent on their synchronized vacation, Max had taken Friday off to extend a family weekend, and most departments showed similar gaps in attendance.
"Smaller crowd this quarter," Luc commented, joining Jay at his observation point.
"I like it better this way. Less overwhelming."
"The food is excellent."
"The shrimp appetizers were great," Jay agreed.
"And the weather cooperated perfectly. These outdoor events are always risky, but tonight turned out ideal. Leo's in full hosting mode. He gets really excited about these events. Probably the only time he gets to show off his party planning skills."
Jay smiled while strategically positioning himself to maintain distance from Leo. Their interactions remained cordial, but Jay preferred to avoid him altogether.
"Speaking of which, have you noticed our missing colleagues' vacation timing?" Luc continued.
"You mean the fact that Kim and Ela are both mysteriously unavailable for exactly the same two weeks?"
"What a remarkable coincidence."
Jay sipped his drink, enjoying the diplomatic gossip. "I mean, they did seem very comfortable with each other at the concert. Think they'll make it official when they get back?"
"Depends how their mysterious simultaneous vacation goes. Either they'll come back together or they'll never speak again."  
"That's rather dramatic."  
"Office relationships usually are. High stakes, limited privacy, everyone watching for developments."  
Jay felt a slight chill despite the warm evening air. "Sounds complicated."  
"Very. Probably why most people avoid them entirely."
"What's the official stance on office relationships anyway?" Jay asked.
Luc's expression became more serious. "No official policy beyond the usual chain-of-command restrictions. But everyone knows it's risky business. Things can get complicated quickly."
"Complicated how?"
"Breakups affect team dynamics. Favouritism accusations. Liability issues. Why do you ask?"
"Just curious about how these things work."
"My advice? The complications aren't worth it, no matter how attractive the person might be."
Jay nodded, absorbing this information. "That makes sense. Keep things separate."
"Exactly. Much more prudent."
The conversation moved on to safer topics, but Jay thought about the complexities of workplace relationships for the rest of the evening. His attention occasionally drifted to where Ian was engaged in discussion with Turner senior and several board members. Even at social events, Ian maintained focus, though Jay noticed he looked more relaxed in the outdoor setting.
After an hour of socializing, Jay gravitated toward a quieter corner of the venue. A small fountain provided gentle background sound, the water catching the light from nearby torches and creating shifting patterns of illumination. Stone benches arranged around the fountain offered refuge from the main party area without completely isolating him from the celebration.
He sat on one of the benches, appreciating the moment of relative solitude. The party continued behind him, but the fountain's peaceful ambience created a buffer that made the sounds feel distant.
"Hiding from the festivities?"
Jay looked up to find Ian approaching, holding a glass of wine and wearing an expression of mild amusement.
"Just enjoying the ambience," Jay replied, gesturing toward the fountain and torchlit surroundings. "It's beautiful here."
"Leo has excellent taste in venues, whatever his other faults," Ian said as he sat on the bench beside him.
Jay looked up at the strings of lights draped throughout the garden, their warm glow creating patterns of light and shadow. "I love the lighting decoration. The garlands of lights glittering everywhere make it feel like a fairy tale setting."
Ian followed his gaze upward, his expression more critical. "It's rather gaudy."
"I think it's lovely. The lights create exactly the right atmosphere for an evening celebration."
"Perhaps you're right. It does suit the garden setting, even if it's not my preference."
Their conversation drifted to other topics—the successful completion of the quarterly reports, upcoming projects that would begin after the holiday season, general observations about their colleagues and the evening's festivities. 
"Speaking of upcoming plans," Ian said eventually, "you still haven't submitted your holiday request. Disregard my schedule and choose dates that work for you."
"I honestly don't have specific plans that require particular timing."
"No travel arrangements? Personal commitments that would benefit from extended time off?"
"Not really. I rarely even leave the city for holidays. A few days off here and there suit me perfectly."
"Jay, you've been working here for a year. You've earned vacation time, and you should use it for something more meaningful than staying home in the city."
"I'm content with my current approach to time off. Not everyone needs elaborate vacation plans."
Ian looked like he wanted to argue further but seemed to recognize the futility of the discussion. Jay had clearly thought about his vacation preferences and reached conclusions that differed from Ian's expectations.
"At least consider taking a full week at some point. Even if you spend it entirely in your apartment, the complete break from work can be refreshing."
"I'll think about it," Jay promised, meaning it sincerely even though he suspected his thinking wouldn't lead to dramatically different choices.
The party continued around them as evening deepened into night, the torch lights becoming more prominent as natural light faded. Their conversation continued comfortably—touching on various topics without particular agenda, simply two people who had grown to enjoy each other's company sharing observations about their work and their world.
Eventually, Ian got up with obvious reluctance. "I should circulate more. Leo will notice if I spend the entire evening hiding in corners."
"Of course. Can't have people thinking you're antisocial."
"Exactly. My reputation as a charming conversationalist depends on making appearances."
As Ian left, Jay remained by the fountain, trailing his fingers in the cool water, content with his solitude and the peaceful atmosphere. He wasn't nervous about company social events anymore, but he still appreciated moments of quiet, especially in settings as beautiful as this garden.
He eventually returned to the buffet for another sampling of the excellent food, exchanged pleasantries with various colleagues, and enjoyed the relaxed social atmosphere.
When it felt appropriate, Jay left the party and headed home, content with his life’s current trajectory. It felt extraordinarily good to be alive, to be part of something meaningful, and to have found his place in a world that had once seemed impossibly foreign.
Chapter 20: Milestones
Scene 1
Thirty and debt-free
July 14th fell on a Saturday this year, and Jay woke up feeling pleased with himself. Today was his thirtieth birthday, but more importantly, it marked the achievement of a goal he'd been pursuing all year with aggressive determination.
His student loans were now paid in full as of this month. They hadn't been particularly large to begin with thanks to his choice of a local college and part-time work throughout school, but under normal circumstances, he'd have been making payments for another five years. His comfortable salary had allowed him to overpay quite dramatically, and even accounting for his clothing expenditures, his savings had grown comfortable enough to support this aggressive strategy. He'd wanted to be debt-free by his thirtieth birthday, and he'd reached that goal right on schedule.
He'd learned earlier in the year that his colleagues didn't make office birthday celebrations—apparently not everyone was comfortable with the attention. Amy had declared she no longer acknowledged birthdays after turning forty, and Ian reportedly didn't celebrate at all. The office policy was no gifts or cakes in the office to avoid awkwardness. The arrangement suited Jay perfectly, since he disliked being the center of attention anyway. Becoming debt-free was gift enough to himself.
His mother called in the morning with birthday wishes, and he could hear all his siblings chiming in with their own greetings in the background. The chaos was endearing, and Jay smiled as Ema demanded to know if he was celebrating properly in the big city.
"I'm planning a very exciting day of laundry and grocery shopping," Jay told her, which prompted immediate protests about his boring lifestyle.
He went to the gym as always. There was no reason to abandon good habits just because of a birthday.  
"Well, well. Look who's officially thirty today. Happy birthday," Rus said, consulting his tablet as Jay approached the weight station.
"Thanks. How did you—"
"Membership records. Which means today we celebrate properly," Rus grinned with mock menace.
Jay eyed him suspiciously. "What does that mean?"
"Means you get the birthday special. We're doing a full-body circuit that's going to make you question your life choices."
"That sounds more like punishment than celebration."
"Same thing, really. You'll thank me when you're in the best shape of your life." Rus loaded additional weight onto the machine. 
Jay groaned but couldn't suppress a smile. "You're enjoying this way too much."
"Absolutely. Don't think I'm going easy on you just because it's your special day."
Back at his apartment, sore but satisfied, Jay decided to experiment with some of the herbs from his mother's gift package. He'd looked up recipes that used hyssop and borage, deciding on a meat stew that promised interesting flavour combinations. The specialty herbs created an unusual aroma while cooking, not unpleasant, but definitely unfamiliar. 
On impulse, he created the social media account he'd been avoiding, adding his siblings and mother as his first connections. He photographed the finished stew alongside the herb package, captioning it "birthday experiments" before posting his first ever social media content. The process was more complicated than expected. His small kitchenette wasn't photogenic, and he had to take six attempts to create something presentable. Even then, the result looked amateurish compared to the effortless quality of Ian's office photography. Jay scrolled through those images again, feeling frustrated that the same phone camera produced such different results in Ian's hands.
"Completely unfair," he muttered to himself.
He ate the stew at his small table while browsing apartment listings on his laptop. Now that he was debt-free, there was no justification for delaying a serious real estate search. Paying the same in rent as he would for mortgage payments on a cramped studio with no elevator and inadequate air conditioning made no financial sense, regardless of how much he enjoyed the neighbourhood.
The heat made scheduling property viewings impractical, and the upcoming holiday season would mean extra work covering for vacationing colleagues, but Jay began comparing options seriously. He researched prices, read forums about different neighborhoods, and compared mortgage conditions from various banks. At thirty, he felt ready for this new chapter of his life to begin.
One-bedroom places closer to the financial district were within his budget, offering modern amenities, proper climate control and in-unit laundry, which seemed almost impossibly extravagant after years of basement laundromat visits.
He bookmarked several promising listings and made notes about questions to ask real estate agents. The process felt significant, a symbol of the stability he'd built over the past year. Twelve months ago, he'd been anxious about affording basic necessities. Now he was researching property ownership.
As evening approached, his phone buzzed with more birthday messages from extended family and a few friends from college. The attention was pleasant, and he responded to each with appreciation.
Meanwhile, across the city, Ian spent the day engaged in an internal debate that had been building for weeks. He knew Jay's birthday, had known it for months, having memorized Jay's personnel files through repeated readings. Initially, he'd reviewed the information as a precaution, looking for inconsistencies or warning signs. Lately, he returned to the files for less defensible reasons, studying the photos, or perhaps seeking insights he couldn't name.
The question of whether to acknowledge Jay's birthday had occupied his thoughts all day. He'd drafted and deleted several text messages, none of which struck the right tone. Too formal seemed cold, too casual felt inappropriate for their relationship.
He didn't send birthday wishes to other employees. There was no precedent for personal communication outside of work contexts. He couldn't justify the gesture, no matter how much he wanted to reach out.
By evening, Ian had convinced himself that staying silent was the prudent choice. They weren't close enough to warrant personal birthday acknowledgments. He told himself this restraint was appropriate. He was maintaining necessary distance, protecting both Jay's comfort and his own objectivity. Ian clung to these rationalizations as if they represented salvation, but he knew deep down they were just the remnants of defences that had been crumbling for months.
The unsent birthday message remained in his drafts folder, a small symbol of the internal conflict that had become his constant companion. Ian closed his phone and tried to focus on other matters, deliberately avoiding thinking about how Jay was spending his thirtieth birthday alone, probably content and certainly unaware of how much his happiness had come to matter to someone who was supposed to remain detached.
The shoreline of emotional safety had disappeared from Ian's view, but he continued pretending he could still see it, as if maintaining the illusion might somehow restore the equilibrium he'd already lost.
Scene 2
A life made
Monday morning felt different as Jay prepared for work. Thirty. The number had weight that he couldn't dismiss.
A decade ago, the prospect of reaching this age without clear direction or meaningful achievement had filled him with dread. He had imagined himself struggling in dead-end positions while college friends established careers, relationships, and the markers of adult success that seemed impossibly distant from his own circumstances.
The metro ride to Northlight Financial Center felt identical to countless previous mornings, but Jay observed his reflection in the train windows with fresh perspective. The man looking back wore a perfectly tailored suit, held a beautiful leather briefcase, and looked like he belonged in the financial district's landscape.
When had that transformation occurred? The changes had been so gradual that he had never noticed their cumulative effect. Months of working alongside accomplished colleagues, handling increasingly complex responsibilities, and dressing according to standards that once seemed impossibly sophisticated had created a version of himself that would have been unrecognizable a year earlier.
Success felt less important than happiness, Jay realized as he emerged from the metro into the morning bustle of the financial district. He had indeed become successful, more so than his modest background and unremarkable credentials should have allowed, but the achievement mattered less than the simple fact that he enjoyed his daily life.
Turner & Associates' offices welcomed him with a sense of comfort. The space felt like home after so many months of extended hours, with his workstation now thoroughly personalized with items that balanced practical needs and personal preferences.
His closet contained spare clothes. The desk drawers held his neatly organized collection of office supplies—notes in a rainbow of hues, pens and highlighters for document markup, various notepads for different purposes, and his trusty notebook—now filled with information about Turner & Associates' inner workings
The kitchen area bore subtle signs of his influence as well. The fridge now stocked smoothies that matched his preferences, thanks to conversations with procurement staff. His requests had also resulted in expanded fruit selections and herb options that allowed him to create refreshing summer drinks during the heat. Small customization that made the office environment feel more personal and comfortable.
With Kim and Ela still absent on their coordinated vacation, the remaining team continued covering their responsibilities with varying degrees of grace. Amy had taken on the more complex aspects of Kim's database management while Jay handled the straightforward maintenance tasks, while Ela's client communication tasks were distributed among everyone else according to expertise and availability.
Jay had managed his expanded duties without major incidents, and he remained optimistic about maintaining that record through the remainder of their absence, even though technical troubleshooting still felt precarious despite Kim's detailed notes.
Jay had also established relationships throughout the building that extended far beyond his immediate department. He knew most employees by name, even those with whom he rarely interacted. The  receptionist greeted him warmly, the security personnel recognized him, and even the cleaning crew acknowledged him with friendly waves.
His familiarity with Turner & Associates' operations had expanded far beyond his original job description. He understood the workflows of multiple departments and administrative processes that had once seemed mysterious and intimidating.
The comfort level extended to his colleagues as well. While he wouldn't claim close friendships with most of them, Jay felt included in the office community. His relationship with Luc had developed into easy camaraderie. His connection with Ian had evolved into something more complex.
Perhaps most importantly, Jay approached each workday with enthusiasm. He woke each morning knowing that whatever challenges awaited, the day would be fundamentally good. This wasn't naive optimism but realistic confidence based on consistent positive experiences.
Around two o'clock, Ian's phone rang with an unexpected client matter. Jay could hear only Ian's side of the conversation, and the tone indicated someone requiring immediate attention.
"Conference room in half an hour," Ian announced after ending the call. "Wentworth requested an urgent consultation. Amy, I'll need your input on the emerging markets component."
Jay gathered his laptop and notebook without being asked, having learned that client meetings often generated documentation requirements that were easier to handle in real-time. He headed to the conference room and positioned himself at the side table where he could take notes without intruding on the primary conversation, his laptop ready for whatever might be required.
Client meetings no longer triggered the panic they once had, though Jay remained alert to potential complications. He had attended enough such sessions to understand the usual flow and his supporting role within the overall dynamic.
The Wentworth representatives arrived looking harried, caught in an unexpected crisis and asking for immediate guidance on their investment strategy.
Ian handled their concerns competently, explaining hedging strategies and risk management approaches with clarity that made even Jay understand the underlying principles. Amy provided technical details about emerging market trends that supported Ian's recommendations and addressed the clients' specific worries about regional instability.
Jay typed throughout the discussion, capturing details that would be crucial for follow-up actions and documentation. The conversation flowed smoothly, with Ian and Amy working in seamless coordination to address every concern the clients raised.
By the time Wentworth representatives departed an hour later, they appeared relieved about their portfolio's risk profile, the prompt consultation potentially preventing costly oversights.
Jay returned to his desk and immediately began formatting his meeting notes into a comprehensive summary for distribution. The document included action items for follow-up and key decision points that might require future reference.
He printed copies for relevant files and sent electronic versions to Ian and Amy within thirty minutes of the meeting's conclusion. The work felt automatic now, part of his standard response to client interactions that required documentation and follow-up planning.
The afternoon passed quickly as Jay caught up on tasks that had been postponed for the unexpected meeting. Email correspondence, document formatting, and administrative coordination filled the remaining hours until the office began its usual evening transition.
When eight o'clock arrived, Jay and Ian gathered their belongings. The elevator ride to the lobby, brief goodbyes as Ian continued to the garage level, and Jay's walk to the metro station—all of it felt natural.
The evening air retained the day's heat as Jay walked toward his stop. Thirty years old, established in a career that challenged and rewarded him, surrounded by colleagues who treated him with respect and appreciation—life had indeed sorted itself out.
Scene 3
Conventional wisdom
The morning briefing on Tuesday proceeded as usual, Ian reviewing the day's priorities while Jay took notes and confirmed scheduling details. Client calls at ten and two, document reviews between meetings, correspondence that needed attention.
As they concluded their review of immediate tasks, Ian added an unexpected question.
"Are you planning to leave at five today as well?"
Jay felt heat rise in his cheeks, embarrassed that his Tuesday departure pattern had become noticeable enough to warrant comment. 
"Yes, if that's not a problem. It's my gym day."
"No problem at all. I was just curious. It's good that you're maintaining a consistent routine. Exercise habits are important."
"I do my best to take care of myself," Jay said, already edging toward his desk to escape the unexpected scrutiny.
The brief exchange left him feeling exposed. It wasn't the first time Ian had asked about his personal habits, but having his workout schedule specifically noticed made him self-conscious about his modest fitness efforts compared to Ian's obviously rigorous training regimen. Jay couldn't help but remember Ian's athletic build, and the thought left him uneasy about his own scrawny constitution.
Then he realized he was sitting at his desk thinking about his boss's physique, which created an entirely new layer of embarrassment that made him focus determinedly on his computer screen.
The rest of the day proceeded normally. The oppressive heatwave had finally broken, making the midday lunch expedition more pleasant than it had been in weeks. Without Kim's persistent advocacy for experimental cuisine, the reduced team selected a safe restaurant that offered reliable food and excellent air conditioning without culinary adventure.
When five o'clock arrived, Jay gathered his belongings, saying goodbyes to his remaining colleagues before heading home to change into his gym clothes.
His session with Rus began at six in the gym's modest facility. The trainer had become a regular fixture in Jay's routine, providing both technical guidance and casual conversation that made the workout time pass more enjoyably.
"How did your birthday go?" Rus asked as they began the warm-up.
"I don't really celebrate birthdays. Hard to organize festivities when you don't know many people in the city besides coworkers."
"That's a shame. You should consider joining some of our group fitness classes. Great way to meet fellow exercise enthusiasts."
"I'll think about it," Jay replied, though he doubted he would follow through on the suggestion.
The workout proceeded with its usual combination of challenging exercises and encouraging commentary from Rus. Jay had grown to appreciate both the physical benefits of regular training and the mental break it provided from work-related thoughts. The hour passed quickly, leaving him tired but satisfied with his effort.
By seven o'clock, he was back in his apartment, enjoying the improved air conditioning performance now that the extreme temperatures had moderated. He reheated the elaborate stew he had prepared over the weekend, and as he ate, he thought back to the morning's conversation with Ian.
The initial embarrassment had faded, replaced by what might have been pleasure that Ian paid attention to his personal habits, even if the interest stemmed from practical scheduling concerns and not from curiosity about Jay's life.
Rus's suggestion about group fitness activities returned to his thoughts as well. The trainer clearly meant well and probably had valid points about the social benefits of expanding his circle of acquaintances. But Jay didn't feel particularly lonely, and the prospect of working out with strangers held little appeal.
Ian's daily companionship, however subtle and business focused, provided an unexpected source of fulfillment. Their extended evening hours together, their morning briefings, the gradual development of both light banter and meaningful conversation—all of it created a sense of connection.
The rest of the week proceeded much as expected—long days where Jay remained in the office until eight each evening, working alongside Ian through the quieter summer schedule. Despite several colleagues' continued absence on vacation, the workload remained manageable, creating space for the leisurely evening atmosphere that had become one of Jay's favorite aspects of his routine.
Jay was making his last coffee of the day on the late Thursday afternoon, the office having emptied considerably. He lingered by the kitchen window, drawn to the view of the city stretching out below in the golden hour light. The skyline looked different at this time of day, with the harsh angles of buildings mellowed by the warm glow.
Ian appeared beside him, holding an empty cup.
"The view never gets old," Ian remarked, following Jay's gaze across the cityscape.
"I was just thinking the same thing. It's especially nice this time of day, when the light hits everything differently."
Ian prepared his coffee, then joined Jay at the window. "Did you see they're finally breaking ground on that new park project? The one where the old textile factories used to be."
Jay's face lit up with enthusiasm. "The Green Range development? I've been following that project for months. It's going to be incredible when it's finished—fifteen hectares of parkland right in the heart of the district."
"You seem invested in it."
"It's only about fifteen minutes from my apartment. I walk past the construction site regularly. They're preserving some of the original brick facade and incorporating it into the landscape design. It's going to enhance the entire neighborhood."
"I didn't realize you were so interested in urban planning." 
"I love parks. Well-designed green spaces make the city feel more livable."
Their evening conversations had become more frequent and natural, touching on everything from work observations to general commentary about the city, the weather, and the peculiarities of their industry. Jay treasured these exchanges, finding in them an intellectual companionship he had never known he wanted.
When Friday arrived and they exchanged their usual weekend farewells, Jay realized he was already looking forward to Monday's return to the office. Continuing their gradual evolution toward something that felt increasingly like friendship felt more appealing than whatever recreational activities the weekend might offer.
Saturday's gym session with Rus included a predictable follow-up about fitness opportunities.
"Have you thought any more about joining some group activities?" 
"I'm so busy with work that I barely have time for these individual sessions. Adding more would be difficult to manage."
Rus shook his head with gentle disappointment. "That's a pity. Work-life balance is important for long-term health and happiness."
Jay nodded politely but didn't share Rus's concern about his work-focused lifestyle. Time spent at Turner & Associates didn't feel like a burden that needed balancing with external activities. The work itself provided social connection and a sense of purpose.
If that meant he spent more time in Ian's company than conventional wisdom deemed healthy, Jay was content to let conventional wisdom take care of itself. Some arrangements worked better than others, and his current situation worked exceptionally well.
Scene 4
Relationship woes
When Kim and Ela returned, they maintained the pretence while exchanging subtle glances across their desks. Nobody addressed their obvious relationship directly, but the knowing looks between other team members indicated the secret was poorly kept.
"Think they'll make it official eventually?" Jay asked Luc during their morning coffee break.
"They're trying so hard to be subtle that everyone notices more. Classic office romance mistake."
Kim was pleased to discover that nothing had gone catastrophically wrong during his absence. He reviewed the database maintenance logs Jay had kept with obvious relief, nodding approvingly.
"Everything looks perfect. No system crashes, no data corruption, no emergency calls to IT. You handled it better than I expected."
Zoe's departure for a two-week scuba diving vacation created another gap in their workforce, but her absence didn't add significantly to Jay's workload. Her responsibilities were more easily distributed among the remaining team members, unlike Kim's specialized technical duties that required dedicated coverage.
The return of Kim's adventurous palate immediately reinvigorated the lunch selection process. His relentless enthusiasm for culinary exploration had been noticeably absent during his vacation. Now the daily restaurant debates resumed with renewed intensity.
"There's a new coastal place two blocks over. They specialize in fermented flatbreads and spiced stews," Kim announced during Monday’s lunch planning.
"That sounds a bit ambitious for lunch," Max replied cautiously.
"Exactly why we should try it," Kim countered, his enthusiasm making his food advocacy both compelling and occasionally exhausting.
Jay welcomed Kim's return to form with relief. Left to his own devices, Jay invariably chose conventional options that posed no risk of disappointment or digestive adventure. Kim’s persistent pressure to expand everyone’s culinary horizons had introduced Jay to flavours and preparations he would never have discovered independently.
"I’m willing to try it," Jay said, surprising himself with his eagerness.
The restaurant was an excellent choice, with communal platters that encouraged conversation and sharing. Jay appreciated both the food itself and the way Kim’s selections consistently pushed the team toward experiences that enriched their daily life.
The first half of the week proceeded at a relaxed pace. Jay continued his extended evening hours with Ian, enjoying the productive quiet of their shared workspace after the rest of the office had emptied.
Wednesday brought an unexpected surge of activity when a major client submitted a request for additional documentation that required assembly from various sources. The project involved consolidating materials from multiple departments and formatting everything according to specific client requirements.
Jay accepted the assignment eagerly, recognizing it as a challenge that utilized his skills while providing valuable learning opportunities about the company's historical operations. The work was time-consuming but not technically complex, making it perfect for his skill level.
"I can handle this. I'm staying late anyway, and it's better if one person maintains consistency throughout the assembly process," Jay told Luc, who had been assigned the project initially.
Luc's relief was immediately apparent. "Are you sure? It's going to take at least two full evenings to complete properly."
"Absolutely. No problem at all."
Jay worked diligently for two days, gathering materials, organizing them according to the client's specifications, and ensuring that every detail met the standards. Ian reviewed the completed files, suggested minor corrections that Jay implemented immediately, and approved the final submission.
"Thanks for taking that on. I owe you a drink for saving me from two nights of extended hours." Luc said when the project was completed. "
"Don't mention it. It was actually interesting work."
"You realize you're doing analyst work for assistant pay," Max observed.
"I'm learning valuable skills."
"You're also making the rest of us look lazy."
Jay felt pleased by the acknowledgement. A year ago, such recognition would have seemed impossible.
"I can't thank you enough for covering so much this summer. My girlfriend was ready to kill me last year when I worked eighty-hour weeks during vacation season," Luc said as they prepared to leave for the day. 
"How are things with her?" Jay asked.
Luc's expression darkened slightly. "Not great, honestly. We argue constantly these days. She thinks I should be more serious about life at my age. Why is everyone so eager to be miserable?"
"What does that mean?"
"Career advancement, marriage timeline, mortgage discussions. Meanwhile, I'm perfectly content splitting a condo with three guys from college and occasionally staying out until three in the morning. Is that really so selfish?"
"I don't think wanting to be ready for major decisions is selfish," Jay replied carefully, without offering solutions he didn't possess. His own romantic experience was woefully limited.
"She says I'm wasting my potential. I say I'm enjoying my youth while I still have it. What about you? Anyone pressuring you to settle down and become respectable?"
"Career takes precedence right now."
Luc raised an eyebrow. "That's interesting, considering you turned down Ian's promotion offer. Advancement doesn't seem like your top priority."
"It's complicated."
Jay deflected further questions, but the conversation stayed with him. His motivations had changed over the past year. The prestigious job he'd initially wanted for security had become something deeper—a sense of belonging he'd never experienced before.
Amy departed for her own vacation on Friday, creating a bigger gap in their workforce. With both Zoe and Amy absent, the remaining team members faced increased workloads that ended the leisurely evening atmosphere Jay had grown to appreciate.
"No more relaxed evenings for a while. Everyone will need to cover additional responsibilities until people start returning," Ian observed as they reviewed the week's accomplishments.
Jay nodded, already mentally adjusting his expectations for the coming weeks. The extended hours would continue, but they would be filled with pressing tasks instead of the comfortable discretionary projects and casual conversations.
The coming weeks would test everyone's adaptability as they managed reduced staffing levels and maintained service quality for clients who expected consistent excellence regardless of summer schedules. But Jay felt confident about the challenges ahead, knowing that his role had evolved to the point where he could contribute meaningfully.
Scene 5
One year
The calendar's progression to August held unusual weight this year, marking not just another month but a complete revolution around the change that had remade Jay's daily existence. One full year at Turner & Associates—a milestone that would have seemed impossible to reach during those first terrifying weeks when every task felt like a potential catastrophe.
Ian called Jay into his office for what he described as an annual review, scheduled for Thursday morning in his office with the door closed.
"Please, sit down," Ian said, gesturing toward the chairs arranged across from his desk. The formal setup felt almost ceremonial after so many months of casual interaction.
"You've been here a full year now," Ian said, consulting a folder that probably contained Jay's employment records. "Your performance has been exemplary."
"Thank you," Jay said, uncertain about the tone Ian was trying to establish.
"You've expanded your responsibilities far beyond the original role description, demonstrated reliability during crisis periods, and integrated seamlessly into our team dynamic. Which brings me to my previous offer. You're clearly capable of handling regular analyst duties. The position I mentioned six months ago is still available if you're interested."
Jay didn't hesitate. "I'd rather stay where I am."
"You're sure? It would mean better advancement opportunities, more varied work."
"I'm happy in my current role."
Ian nodded slowly. "Then we'll leave things as they are."
The moment felt charged, but Jay couldn't decode the undercurrent of tension in Ian's demeanour.
"Actually," Ian continued, reaching into his desk drawer and producing a rectangular box. "I have something for you."
"What's this?"
"One-year anniversary gift."
Jay accepted the box sceptically. "I've never heard of one-year anniversaries warranting gifts."
"No other assistant has lasted this long. I've had a dozen in my career, so that means something."
Jay opened the box. Inside, nestled in silk lining, was a watch. Even his untrained eye could recognize its quality—the leather band was soft, the face elegant, every detail speaking of craftsmanship and expense.
"It's also compensation for the circumstances of your hiring. And for your thirtieth birthday."
Jay stared at it, uncertain how to respond.
"Jay." Ian's voice had gone quiet, almost hesitant. "It's also an apology."
"For what?"
"During your first year, you were wronged repeatedly, and I never properly acknowledged my role in that. I was distant when you needed guidance. I rebuffed your questions when you were trying to learn. I allowed office gossip to affect you. I didn't prepare you adequately for company events. I didn't protect you from harassment at the gala. These were failures of leadership on my part. A watch isn't adequate compensation for those slights, but it's a token of my sincerity."
Jay felt heat climb his neck. "None of those were your fault."
"They were my responsibility. You deserved better mentorship from the beginning. I can't undo the times I was colder than necessary, or the moments when my caution probably seemed like rejection. But I want you to know that those failings were mine, not yours. You have been exemplary from day one, and I should have made that clear much sooner."
The intensity in Ian's voice made Jay uncomfortable. He fumbled for a response that might deflect the weight of the moment.
Ian seemed to recognize his discomfort. "Besides," he added with forced lightness, "Leo paid for it. He's mostly to blame for everything that went wrong, so you can accept it without feeling burdened."
Jay managed a weak smile. "In that case."
He returned to his desk with the watch box. A quick internet search revealed the price was roughly half his annual salary. A year ago, that sum would have been incomprehensible. Now he thought it would complement his midnight blue suit nicely.
He fastened the watch around his wrist, studying how it looked against his sleeve. It was heavier than Jay expected. Like everything else in his new life, it fit perfectly.
His eyes moved to the leather messenger bag Leo had given him during his first week. It sat beside his desk, still pristine despite daily use, testament to quality craftsmanship. Back then, it had been his only possession that belonged in this environment. Now everything about him matched the setting.
He looked toward Ian's office, where his boss was reviewing documents. There was no other place he would rather be than here, no other role he would rather fill than supporting Ian's work.
Jay touched the watch lightly with his other hand, unsure about the true significance of Ian’s gift but certain it ran deeper than Ian's explanation. It felt monumental somehow, and Jay resolved that he would never take it off.
He realized that he had never been happier in his life. Not just content with his career or financially secure. He felt true happiness that encompassed his entire existence. Turner & Associates had given him stability, his colleagues had provided friendship, and Ian had offered something more precious that Jay was only beginning to understand. The bond between them felt real, and words seemed insufficient to describe what was actually happening.
That evening, Ian sat in his living room with his head in his hands, replaying the afternoon's conversation. Jay's immediate refusal to transfer, the relief that had flooded through him at that response. The careful words of his apology had barely contained the deeper truth he couldn't acknowledge.
He was in love with Jay Hall. Had been for months, probably. The realization wasn't sudden—it had been building gradually. But watching Jay's face as he opened the gift, seeing the surprise and confusion in his expression, the way his beautiful eyes looked at him, Ian could no longer pretend his feelings were merely protective or appreciative.
The admiration in Jay's eyes was pure, innocent, completely without awareness of Ian as anything more than a mentor. Jay didn't see him as a man at all—just as an authority figure worthy of respect and gratitude.
And that meant Ian was in love, hopelessly and completely, with someone he could never have. But knowing it was impossible didn't change the reality of what he felt. It only made the daily proximity more challenging.
Ian wondered how he could continue pretending, how he could maintain the defences that kept them both safe, when every interaction felt like a betrayal of his own heart.
